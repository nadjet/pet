"The Nicholas Carriger Estate (16-acre) is a collection of buildings located in Sonoma, California, United States. The estate consists of three buildings: the main house built in 1847, a small house, which is a replica of the main house, built in 1860, and a winery, built in 1875. The main house and the Little Carriger house fall in the architectural Greek revival style. There also is a locally quarried ""candy rock"" stone small building next to the main house that may have been used as an ice house. The everflowing Yulupa Spring, which supplied water to the houses and is still flowing, is a short walk along a hillside pathway from the main house. In 1979 the estate was designated a Sonoma County Historic Landmark, and in 2001, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Nicholas Carriger built the property after traveling west with his family as a settler of California. Carriger was welcomed to the area by Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo. Vallejo and Carriger would remain lifelong friends. Carriger chose his estate property based on the scenery and the good drainage of the area. He purchased the property, 1,000 acres, from Vallejo. It was on this land that Carriger was reportedly the first American to grow wine grapes in Sonoma Valley. Cattle, purchased from Vallejo, also grazed the property. After an absence to participate in the gold rush, Carriger returned after great success finding gold, to complete the main house in 1850. In 1875, he began construction of his winery building with a large celebration where he laid the cornerstone and a box containing personal items relating to the Carriger family and Sonoma. Nicholas Carriger died in 1885 at his home and is buried with family and other notable pioneers of Sonoma at the Mountain Cemetery in Sonoma, California. After the death of his wife, Mary Ann Wardlow Carriger, in 1891, the property remained in the Carriger family until sold by daughter Levisa Carriger Lewis."

"3-Methylbutanoic acid, also known as β-methylbutyric acid or more commonly isovaleric acid, is a branched-chain alkyl carboxylic acid with the chemical formula (CH3)2CHCH2CO2H. It is classified as a short-chain fatty acid. Like other low-molecular-weight carboxylic acids, it has an unpleasant odor. The compound occurs naturally and can be found in many foods, such as cheese, soy milk, and apple juice."
"Gluconic acid is an organic compound with molecular formula C6H12O7 and condensed structural formula HOCH2(CHOH)4COOH. It is one of the 16 stereoisomers of 2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid. In aqueous solution at neutral pH, gluconic acid forms the gluconate ion. The salts of gluconic acid are known as ""gluconates"". Gluconic acid, gluconate salts, and gluconate esters occur widely in nature because such species arise from the oxidation of glucose. Some drugs are injected in the form of gluconates."
"Malic acid is an organic compound with the molecular formula C4H6O5. It is a dicarboxylic acid that is made by all living organisms, contributes to the sour taste of fruits, and is used as a food additive. Malic acid has two stereoisomeric forms (L- and D-enantiomers), though only the L-isomer exists naturally. The salts and esters of malic acid are known as malates. The malate anion is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle."
"The acids in wine are an important component in both winemaking and the finished product of wine. They are present in both grapes and wine, having direct influences on the color, balance and taste of the wine as well as the growth and vitality of yeast during fermentation and protecting the wine from bacteria. The measure of the amount of acidity in wine is known as the “titratable acidity” or “total acidity”, which refers to the test that yields the total of all acids present, while strength of acidity is measured according to pH, with most wines having a pH between 2.9 and 3.9. Generally, the lower the pH, the higher the acidity in the wine. However, there is no direct connection between total acidity and pH (it is possible to find wines with a high pH for wine and high acidity). In wine tasting, the term “acidity” refers to the fresh, tart and sour attributes of the wine which are evaluated in relation to how well the acidity balances out the sweetness and bitter components of the wine such as tannins. Three primary acids are found in wine grapes: tartaric, malic, and citric acids. During the course of winemaking and in the finished wines, acetic, butyric, lactic, and succinic acids can play significant roles. Most of the acids involved with wine are fixed acids with the notable exception of acetic acid, mostly found in vinegar, which is volatile and can contribute to the wine fault known as volatile acidity. Sometimes, additional acids, such as ascorbic, sorbic and sulfurous acids, are used in winemaking."
"Hippocras (Catalan: Pimentes de clareya; Latin: vīnum Hippocraticum), sometimes spelled hipocras or hypocras, is a drink made from wine mixed with sugar and spices, usually including cinnamon, and possibly heated. After steeping the spices in the sweetened wine for a day, the spices are strained out through a conical cloth filter bag called a manicum hippocraticum or Hippocratic sleeve (originally devised by the 5th century BC Greek physician Hippocrates to filter water), from which the name of the drink is derived."
"May wine, also known as Maitrank, Maiwein, Maibowle and Waldmeisterbowle, is the name of a German beverage that uses aromatized wine as a base. May wine is served in the spring, traditionally on the May Day holiday. The base is made by steeping the fragrant creeping herb sweet woodruff (Galium odoratum, sometimes called Asperula odorata, known in Germany as Waldmeister) that grows in the forests of Northern Europe in a white German wine. It is the specialty of the town of Arlon, in the south of Belgium."
"Lillet (French pronunciation: ​[li.lɛ]), classed as an aromatised wine within EU law, is a French wine-based aperitif from Podensac. It is a blend of 85% Bordeaux region wines (Semillon for the Blanc and for the Rosé, Merlot for the Rouge) and 15% macerated liqueurs, mostly citrus liqueurs (peels of sweet oranges from Spain and Morocco and peels of bitter green oranges from Haiti). The mix is then stirred in oak vats until blended. During the aging process, Lillet is handled as a Bordeaux wine (undergoing fining, racking, filtering etc.). In the original Kina Lillet formulation (so named with respect to its status as a quinquina), quinine liqueur made of cinchona bark from Peru was included among its ingredients. ""Lillet"" belongs to a family of aperitifs known as tonic wines because of the addition of quinine liqueur."
"Kir is a popular French cocktail made with a measure of crème de cassis (blackcurrant liqueur) topped up with white wine. In France it is usually drunk as an apéritif before a meal or snack. It was originally made with Bourgogne Aligoté, a white wine of Burgundy. Now, various white wines are used throughout France, according to the region and the whim of the barkeeper. Many prefer a white Chardonnay-based Burgundy, such as Chablis. It used to be called blanc-cassis, but it is now named after Félix Kir (1876–1968), mayor of Dijon in Burgundy. Kir was a pioneer of the twinning movement in the aftermath of the Second World War, and popularized the drink by offering it at receptions to visiting delegations. Besides treating his international guests well, he was also promoting two economic products of the region. Kir allowed one of Dijon's producers of crème de cassis to use his name, then extended the right to their competitors as well. According to Rolland (2004), the reinvention of blanc-cassis (post 1945) was necessitated by the German Army's confiscation of all the local red Burgundy during the war. Faced with an excess of white wine, Kir renovated a drink that used to be made primarily with the red. Another explanation that has been offered is that Mayor Kir revived it during a year in which the ordinary white wine of the region was inferior and the crème de cassis helped to disguise the fact. Following the commercial development of crème de cassis in 1841, the cocktail became a popular regional café drink, but has since become inextricably linked internationally with the name of Mayor Kir. When ordering a kir, waiters in France sometimes ask whether the customer wants it made with crème de cassis (blackcurrant), de mûre (blackberry), de pêche (peach), or framboise (raspberry). The International Bartenders Association gives a recipe using 1/10 crème de cassis, but French sources typically specify more; 19th-century recipes for blanc-cassis recommended 1/3 crème de cassis, which modern tastes find cloyingly sweet, and modern sources typically about 1/5. Replacing the crème de cassis with blackcurrant syrup is discouraged."
"Rebujito is a cocktail invented in Andalusia that mixes sherry (Manzanilla or Fino) and soft drinks, typically white lemonade or lemon-lime soda. Rebujito is a common drink in Andalusia, and is typical at the Seville Fair. It is similar to a sherry cobbler."
"Kalimotxo or calimocho (Basque pronunciation: [ka.li.mo.tʃo], Spanish pronunciation: [ka.li.ˈmo.tʃo]) is a drink consisting of equal parts red wine and cola-based soft drink. The concoction dates back to the 1920s in Spain, but was relatively uncommon as Coca-Cola wasn't manufactured in the country at that time. The first Coca-Cola factory opened in Spain in 1953, and the drink was ""reborn"" and given its current name in 1972. It has since become a classic of the Basque Country region."
The Black Velvet is a beer cocktail made from a combination of stout (often Guinness) and white sparkling wine (often Champagne).
"The Vesper or Vesper Martini is a cocktail that was originally made of gin, vodka, and Kina Lillet.

"A Bellini is a cocktail made with Prosecco and peach purée or nectar. It originated in Venice, Italy."
"Tinto de verano (literally ""summer red [wine]"") is a cold, wine-based drink popular in Spain. It is similar to sangria, but simpler, being normally made up of 1 part of table red wine and 1 part gaseosa (a general term for sodas and carbonated drinks), although proportions can vary according to taste. The preferred mixer is a mild-flavored, low-sugar, carbonated lemonade, of which La Casera is the best known brand. Traditional gaseosa can be replicated by mixing Sprite or 7-Up with carbonated water. The drink is served over ice, often with a slice of lemon or orange. Rum is sometimes added to the drink. Other variations include red wine mixed with lemon soda, orange soda, or bitter lemon; rosé wine mixed with lemon or orange soda; and red wine mixed with cola (known as calimocho). The drink has its origins in the early 20th century, when Federico Vargas created a mix of a red wine and soda pop for his patrons at Venta Vargas in Cordoba, Spain. The drink was at first called un Vargas but soon came to be known as Tinto de Verano. As the name suggests, tinto de verano is usually served during the summertime. It is often home-made, or bought ready-bottled from supermarkets. In the Costa del Sol and other Southern regions of Spain it is common for locals to drink tinto de verano as it is easy to make oneself, or has many variations of preprepared varieties for the same price as many cola drinks. Sangria is considered more commercial and ""touristy"" as it requires more time to make and is often sold in restaurants at a more expensive price, whereas tinto de verano is common at parties, festivals, and dive bars where drinks are affordable and consumed in volume."
"Zurracapote (sometimes abbreviated as zurra) is a popular Spanish alcoholic mixed drink, similar to sangría. It consists of red wine mixed with fruit such as peaches and lemons, sugar, and cinnamon. The concoction is then traditionally left to steep for several days, though some recipes call for the addition of other alcoholic beverages, juices, and fruit extracts. The result is a mild-to-medium alcoholic drink, similar to sangría. The drink is normally prepared in large receptacles during local festivals with many local variations in recipe. It was first drunk in Calahorra, where ""Peña Phillips"" developed the recipe through several competitions. It is the typical drink of the La Rioja area and nearby areas such as northern Burgos, Soria, , and the Basque Country. It is also prepared in other Spanish provinces, such as Albacete, northern Granada, Ciudad Real, Cuenca, and Guadalajara."
"The Chicago Cocktail is a brandy-based mixed drink probably named for the city of Chicago, Illinois. It has been documented in numerous cocktail manuals dating back to the 19th century. Chicago restaurant critic John Drury included it in his 1931 guide Dining in Chicago, noting that it had been served at the American Bar in Nice and the Embassy Club in London. Whether it originated in Chicago is unknown. Recipes call for brandy; orange-flavored liqueur, such as curacao or triple sec; and bitters, stirred or shaken with ice, which may or may not be strained out afterward. In many versions of the drink, it is topped off with champagne or white wine. Some versions call for sugaring the rim of the glass. It can be served on the rocks in a double old-fashioned glass or, especially in the champagne variation, straight up in a champagne coupe or flute or a cocktail glass."
"An Old Etonian is a gin cocktail which enjoyed great popularity in London, circa 1925.

"A mimosa cocktail is composed of champagne (or other sparkling wine) and chilled citrus juice, usually orange juice unless otherwise specified. It is traditionally served in a tall champagne flute at brunch, at weddings, or as part of business or first class service on some passenger railways and airlines. The mixing ratio of the ""classic mimosa"" differs based on the source."
"A Whisky Macdonald more commonly known under the shortened name Whisky Mac is a cocktail made up of whisky and ginger wine. The whisky is expected to be a Scotch whisky, usually a blended type. The ginger wine should be green ginger wine. Recipes vary from those having equal parts of each ingredient to those that use a ratio of 3 to 2 of whisky to wine. A common recipe is to take 45 millilitres (1+1⁄2 imperial fluid ounces) Scotch whisky and 45 mL (1+1⁄2 imp fl oz) green ginger wine. Pour both of the ingredients into a wine goblet with no ice. A hot version can also be made, akin to a hot toddy, made with the addition of boiling water. The invention of it, and its name, is attributed to Colonel Hector MacDonald, who devised it during the days of the British Raj in India. The mixed drink is sometimes referred to as ""The Golfers' Favourite"". Apparently, golfers drank whisky macs to ward off the cold after a chilly round on the links."

Cleese guides viewers through the basics of wine types and grape varieties, wine making, wine tasting and terminology, buying and storing wines, through direct narrative and interviews with wine makers and wine sellers. The film duration is 92 minutes and includes visits to wineries in California. The film concludes with a large group conducting a blind wine tasting. One of the tasting results was the fact that most tasters could not distinguish between red wine and white wine. Another was that most tasters rated an inexpensive wine equal in taste to an expensive prestige wine, and both of these out scored the rest of the mid-priced and high-priced wines in the blind test."

"Christie's World Encyclopedia of Champagne & Sparkling Wine is an encyclopedia written by Tom Stevenson and , published by Absolute Press, which is devoted to subjects relating to Champagne and sparkling wine. The foreword is written by Michael Broadbent. A smaller reduced version, Champagne & Sparkling Wine Guide, is published in the soft cover format. When first published in 1998, the book became the only wine book to warrant a leader in a UK national newspaper (The Guardian, October 14, 1998), for the first time revealing a 17th-century document proving that the English used a second fermentation to convert still wines into sparkling at least six years before Dom Pérignon arrived at the Abbey of Hautvillers, and nearly 40 years before the French claim that sparkling Champagne was invented. Although Le Figaro accused Stevenson of ""trying to burn Dom Pérignon"", the French were prompt to award it The Best Wine Book of 1998 at the Salon International du Livre Gourmand in Périgueux. Ranked among its ""Top Ten Best Wine Books"" by The Independent it has been characterised as ""still the best guide to fizz"", ""authoritative, opinionated and comprehensive"", and a vital purchase for any Champagne lover."

"The Wines of Alsace by Tom Stevenson was published in 1993 by Faber & Faber. This 600 page book profiles 300 producers, 118 wine villages, 51 grands crus, 84 lieux-dits, 28 clos and 4 wine-producing châteaux of Alsace. The vintage chart stretches from 1992 back to 585. In “Alsace, French or German?”, Stevenson traces the historical development of Alsace back to the Protocelts who settled this part of the Rhine 3,500 years ago, and determines that not only was Alsace originally German, but it was the French who were the first to invade the region. He also researched the popular notion that the reputation of Alsace wine was deliberately lost by the Germans after the Franco-Prussian War, and discovered that prior to that war the French had expanded the region’s vineyards into unsuitable areas on the plains, and planted them with lowly varieties, “proof positive” according to Stevenson that “it was Gallic madness, not German vindictiveness”. Although published in 1993, Stevenson’s portraits of the growers are still considered valid today, due to his ability to capture the essence of the people and their wines. ISBN 0-571-14953-7"

"Vertical is a 2010 novel by Rex Pickett and the second novel in the Sideways Trilogy. It is a sequel to the novel Sideways, which was made into a successful 2004 film of the same name. The novel takes place seven years after the events depicted in Sideways.

The book was self-published by Pickett. He has said that the book is autobiographical: The trip didn’t happen with Jack, but everything with my mother was real. I lived that, and Jack is that character now, he’s a guy who’s gone to seed. And I am a guy who’s had success and overimbibed and did some things that I don’t do anymore."

"Dionysus (/daɪ.əˈnaɪsəs/; Greek: Διόνυσος) is the god of the grape-harvest, winemaking and wine, of fertility, orchards and fruit, vegetation, insanity, ritual madness, religious ecstasy, festivity and theatre in ancient Greek religion and myth. He is also known as Bacchus (/ˈbækəs/ or /ˈbɑːkəs/; Greek: Βάκχος, Bákkhos), the name adopted by the Romans; the frenzy he induces is bakkheia. Another name used by the Romans is Liber meaning ""free"", due to his association with wine and the Bacchanalia and other rites, and the freedom associated with it. His thyrsus, sometimes wound with ivy and dripping with honey, is both a beneficent wand and a weapon used to destroy those who oppose his cult and the freedoms he represents. As Eleutherios (""the liberator""), his wine, music and ecstatic dance free his followers from self-conscious fear and care, and subvert the oppressive restraints of the powerful. Those who partake of his mysteries are believed to become possessed and empowered by the god himself. In his religion, identical with or closely related to Orphism, Dionysus was believed to have been born from the union of Zeus and Persephone, and to have himself represented a chthonic or underworld aspect of Zeus. Many believed that he had been born twice, having been killed and reborn as the son of Zeus and the mortal Semele. In the Eleusinian Mysteries he was identified with Iacchus, the son (or, alternately, husband) of Demeter. His origins are uncertain, and his cults took many forms; some are described by ancient sources as Thracian, others as Greek. Though most accounts say he was born in Thrace, traveled abroad, and arrived in Greece as a foreigner, evidence from the Mycenaean period of Greek history shows that he is one of Greece's oldest attested gods. His attribute of ""foreignness"" as an arriving outsider-god may be inherent and essential to his cults, as he is a god of epiphany, sometimes called ""the god that comes"". Wine played an important role in Greek culture, and the cult of Dionysus was the main religious focus surrounding its consumption. Wine, as well as the vines and grapes that produce it, were seen as not only a gift of the god, but a symbolic incarnation of him on earth. However, rather than being a god of drunkenness, as he was often stereotyped in the post-Classical era, the religion of Dionysus centered on the correct consumption of wine, which could ease suffering and bring joy, as well as inspire divine madness distinct from drunkenness. Performance art and drama were also central to his religion, and its festivals were the initial driving force behind the development of theatre. The cult of Dionysus is also a ""cult of the souls""; his maenads feed the dead through blood-offerings, and he acts as a divine communicant between the living and the dead. He is sometimes categorised as a dying-and-rising god. Dionysus is an agriculture and vegetation deity. His connection to wine, grape-harvest, orchards, and vegetation displays his role as a nature god. As the god of viticulture and grapes, he is connected to the growth and harvest of the fruit. In myth, he teaches the art of growing and cultivating the plant."
"BYOB or BYO is an initialism and acronym concerning alcohol that means ""bring your own bottle"" or ""bring your own booze"" or ""bring your own beer"". It can also stand for similar phrases such as ""bring your own blow"", or when relevant, ""bring your own beverage"". BYOB is stated on an invitation to indicate that the host will not be providing alcohol and that guests should bring their own. Some restaurants and business establishments (especially in areas where liquor licenses are difficult to obtain) allow patrons to bring their own bottle, sometimes subject to fees or membership conditions, or because the establishment itself does not have license to sell alcohol."
"Spinning cone columns are used in a form of low temperature vacuum steam distillation to gently extract volatile chemicals from liquid foodstuffs while minimising the effect on the taste of the product. For instance, the columns can be used to remove some of the alcohol from wine, 'off' smells from cream, and to capture aroma compounds that would otherwise be lost in coffee processing."

"Dhokra (also spelt Dokra) is non–ferrous metal casting using the lost-wax casting technique. This sort of metal casting has been used in India for over 4,000 years and is still used. One of the earliest known lost wax artefacts is the dancing girl of Mohenjo-daro. The product of dhokra artisans are in great demand in domestic and foreign markets because of primitive simplicity, enchanting folk motifs and forceful form. Dhokra horses, elephants, peacocks, owls, religious images, measuring bowls, and lamp caskets etc., are highly appreciated. The lost wax technique for casting of copper based alloys has also been found in China, Egypt, Malaysia, Nigeria, Central America, and other places."
"Champagne has featured prominently in popular culture for over a century, due in part to a long history of effective marketing and product placement by leading Champagne houses and their representatives, such as CIVC. In time this created an association of Champagne with luxury and exclusivity. The popularity and positive attributes associated with Champagne have caused many other sparkling wine producers not located in the French wine region of Champagne to incorrectly use the name ""champagne"" to describe their wines."
"The use of vine training systems in viticulture is aimed primarily to assist in canopy management with finding the balance in enough foliage to facilitate photosynthesis without excessive shading that could impede grape ripening or promote grape diseases. Additional benefits of utilizing particular training systems could be to control potential yields and to facilitate mechanization of certain vineyard tasks such as pruning, irrigation, applying pesticide or fertilizing sprays as well as harvesting the grapes. In deciding on what type of vine training system to use, growers will also consider the climate conditions of the vineyard where the amount of sunlight, humidity and wind could have a large impact on the exact benefits the training system offers. For instance, while having a large spread out canopy (such as what the Geneva Double Curtain offers) can promote a favorable for photosynthesis, it offers very little wind protection. In places such as the Châteauneuf-du-Pape, strong prevailing winds such as le mistral can take the fruit right off the vine so a more condensed, protective vine training system is desirable for vineyards there. While closely related, the terms trellising, pruning and vine training are often used interchangeably even though they refer to different things. Technically speaking, the trellis refers to the actual stakes, posts, wires or other structures that the grapevine is attached to. Some vines are allowed to grow free standing without any attachment to a trellising structure. Part of the confusion between trellising and vine training systems stems from the fact that vine training systems will often take on the name of the particular type of trellising involved. Pruning refers to the cutting and shaping of the cordon or ""arms"" of the grapevine in winter which will determine the number of buds that are allowed to become grape clusters. In some wine regions, such as France, the exact number of buds is outlined by Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) regulations. During the summer growing season, pruning can involve removing young plant shoots or excess bunches of grapes with green harvesting. Vine training systems utilize the practice of trellising and pruning in order to dictate and control a grape vine's canopy which will influence not only the potential yield of that year's crop but also the quality of the grapes due to the access of air and sunlight needed for the grapes to ripen fully and for preventing various grape diseases."

"The Champagne Riots of 1910 and 1911 resulted from a series of problems faced by grape growers in the Champagne area of France. These included four years of disastrous crop losses, the infestation of the phylloxera louse (which destroyed 15,000 acres (6,100 ha) of vineyards that year alone), low income and the belief that wine merchants were using grapes from outside the Champagne region. The precipitating event may have been the announcement in 1908 by the French government that it would delimit by decree the exact geographic area that would be granted economic advantage and protection by being awarded the Champagne appellation. This early development of Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée regulation benefitted the Marne and Aisne districts to the significant exclusion of the Aube district which included the town of Troyes—the historic capital of the Champagne region."
"Bloody Sunday is a name given to political clashes that occurred in Colmar, Alsace, France on August 22, 1926. On that day the French Communist Party and the Colmar section of the Popular Republican Union (a Catholic organization) had organized a joint protest meeting at the Salle des Catherinettes. The theme of the meeting was to denounce measures by the French state against the signatories of the Alsatian autonomist manifesto. However, a large group of French nationalists had assembled at the meeting point of the rally. They included the royalist Camelots du Roi and Action française. The French nationalists sought to blockade the Alsatian autonomists from holding their meeting. As Dr. Eugène Ricklin, a clerical autonomist and one of the main speakers of the event, and Joseph Rossé, reached the Colmar train station, they were attacked by the French nationalists. At the site of the meeting, violent clashes erupted again. Police, partly mounted, slowly intervened. Around 60 people were injured. Amongst the injured was Ricklin. However, the autonomist rally was conducted despite the violence. The Bloody Sunday rally was significant in breaking up the taboo of cooperation between communists and Catholic autonomists. It also marked the starting point of a split between a section of Alsatian communists and the French Communist Party. Bloody Sunday furthered cooperation between Alsatian communists with right-wing sectors sharing common autonomist goals, which would eventually lead to the expulsion of a sector of Alsatian communists from the French Communist Party in 1929. The expellees founded the Opposition Communist Party of Alsace-Lorraine."

"The Pan-European Picnic (German: Paneuropäisches Picknick; Hungarian: páneurópai piknik; Slovak: Paneurópsky piknik) was a peace demonstration held on the Austrian-Hungarian border near Sopron, Hungary on 19 August 1989. The opening of the border gate between Austria and Hungary at the Pan-European Picnic set in motion a peaceful chain reaction, at the end of which there was the German reunification, the Iron Curtain fell apart and the Eastern Bloc had disintegrated. The communist governments and the Warsaw Pact subsequently dissolved, ending the Cold War. As a result, this also led to the disintegration of the Soviet Union. The idea of opening the border at a ceremony and testing the Soviet Union's response came from Otto von Habsburg, the then President of the Paneuropean Union, and was brought up by him to Miklós Németh, the then Hungarian Prime Minister, who also promoted the idea. The Pan-European Picnic itself developed from a meeting between Otto von Habsburg and Ferenc Mészáros of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) in June 1989. The local organisation in Sopron took over the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the other contacts were made via Habsburg and the Hungarian Minister of State Imre Pozsgay. The Austrian Paneuropean Union and the MDF took care of advertising the event with leaflets that were distributed in Hungary. The patrons of the picnic, Habsburg and Pozsgay, who were not present at the event, saw the planned event as an opportunity to test Mikhail Gorbachev's reaction to an opening of the border on the Iron Curtain. The official emblem of the picnic was a pigeon breaking through the barbed wire. At the picnic several hundred East German citizens overran the old wooden gate, reaching Austria unhindered by the border guards around Árpád Bella. It was the largest mass exodus since the Berlin Wall was built in 1961. The Hungarian borders were opened on 11 September, and the Berlin Wall fell on 9 November. The Warsaw Pact disintegrated in 1991."
"Alemannic Separatism is a historical movement of separatism of the Alemannic-German-speaking areas of Germany, France and Austria (viz., South Baden, Swabia (viz. most of Württemberg and all of Bavarian Swabia), Alsace and Vorarlberg), aiming at a unification with the Swiss Confederacy (later Switzerland). The historic origins of the movement lay in the Napoleonic era (ca. 1805–1815) and it was briefly revived both after the end of World War I (1919) and after the end of World War II (1946–1952)."
"The Twelve Grapes (Sp. las doce uvas de la suerte, ""the twelve grapes of luck"") is a Spanish tradition that consists of eating a grape with each clock bell strike at midnight of December 31 to welcome the New Year. The twelve grapes date back from at least 1895 but became established in 1909. In December of that year, some alicantese vine growers popularized this custom to better sell huge numbers of grapes from an excellent harvest. According to the tradition, eating the twelve grapes leads to a year of good luck and prosperity. In some areas, it is believed that it wards away witches and general evil, although this ""magic"" is treated like an old heritage, and in modern days it's viewed as a cultural tradition to welcome the new year. There are two main places where people gather to eat the grapes: at home with the family after Nochevieja dinner or in the main squares around the country, being the Puerta del Sol in Madrid the most famous place to do it and where this tradition started. The twelve grapes are closely related to the time ball and clock of the Royal House of the Post Office in Puerta del Sol, from where the change of year is broadcast on Spain's major TV networks, including Televisión Española since 1962. This tradition was also adopted in places with a broad cultural relation with Spain and Latin American countries, as well as Hispanic communities in the United States. The Philippines has adopted the tradition as well. This tradition is part of the Hispanic Christmas festivities."
"The Feria Nacional de San Marcos (San Marcos Fair) is a national fair held in the Mexican state of Aguascalientes every year for three (or sometimes four) weeks. Most of the events related to the fair, however, occur in the city of Aguascalientes, the state capital. The exact date of the fair varies every year but is set around April 25, the Feast Day of San Marcos. Initially the fair was tied to the vendimia (harvesting of grapes) since wine production used to be an important activity in Aguascalientes. Nowadays, it is an important tourist attraction that is heavily associated with bullfighting and cockfighting. It is estimated that seven million people visit the fair every year and as a consequence hotels are usually filled to capacity, however some locals rent out their houses to visitors and go on vacation during this time."
"Haro Wine Festival is a summer festival in the town of Haro in the La Rioja region of Northern Spain. It features a Batalla de Vino (Battle of Wine) and youth bullfights. The Wine Festival takes place on June 29, the day of the patron saint San Pedro. The day begins at 9:00 am, with a procession of people of all ages carrying jugs, bottles, botas and other types of containers filled with red wine. Led by the town mayor on horseback, the procession winds through Haro to the Cliffs of Bilibio. A mass is then celebrated at the Hermitage of San Felices de Bilibio. After the mass, the Battle of Wine commences. The participants toss wine on each other until everyone is completely soaked. This is a super fun event and tourist friendly. At noon, the festival continues at the Plaza de la Paz in Haro. The festival offers ""bullfights"" for youth in the town bullring. However, the ""bulls"" are actually heifers and no animals are killed."
"Panathenaic amphorae were the amphorae, large ceramic vessels, that contained the olive oil given as prizes in the Panathenaic Games. Some were ten imperial gallons (12 US gal; 45 L) and 60–70 cm (24–28 in) high. This oil came from the sacred grove of Athena at Akademia. The amphorae which held it had the distinctive form of tight handles, narrow neck and feet, and they were decorated with consistent symbols, in a standard form using the black figure technique, and continued to be so, long after the black figure style had fallen out of fashion. Some Panathenaic amphorae depicted Athena Promachos, goddess of war, advancing between columns brandishing a spear and wearing the aegis, and next to her the inscription τῶν Ἀθήνηθεν ἄθλων ""(one) of the prizes from Athens"". On the back of the vase was a representation of the event for which it was an award. Sometimes roosters are depicted perched on top of the columns. The significance of the roosters remains a mystery. Later amphorae also had that year's archon's name written on it making finds of those vases archaeologically important. The vases were commissioned by the state from the leading pottery workshops of the day in large numbers. Their canonical shape was set by 530 BC, but the earliest known example is the Burgon vase (British Museum, B130), which depicts Athena's owl nestling on the neck of the vase and on the reverse is a synoris team. This may mean that the vase predates the festival's reorganization in 566 since it is not an athletic event. The cock column is first seen on a panathenaic by Exekias (Karlsruhe 65.45). By the early fourth century the inclusion of the archon's name appears on these vases, the earliest almost intact one being Asteios 373/2 BC. (Oxford, 1911.257). There is a fragment that bears the name Hippodamas of 375/4 BC, however, which may also be a panathenaic, and Beazley suggests there may be a preceding one, Pythokles of 392/1. As the century progressed, the profile of the vases became elongated and the decoration more mannered. The last known dated vase is from 312/11, although production continues into the third and second centuries, the archons are no longer named, instead, the treasurers and stewards of the games are recorded in their place. Some vases were used as grave goods by the families of the victors, some were dedicated to sanctuaries, and still others sold, hence their wide distribution in the Greek world. The survival rate of Greek pottery as a whole may be calculated from the remnant of panathenaic amphorae that exist. After approximately 350 BC at least 1450 vases were awarded every four years in the greater Panathenaia. Assuming the number of events was consistent throughout the history of the games and that all prizes were in the form of decorated amphora, dividing the number of unique vases known by the total production run, gives the figure of between 0.5% and 1% of all Greek vases awarded are still extant.

"Oenophilia (/ˌiːnəˈfɪliə/ EE-nə-FIL-ee-ə; Greek for the love (philia) of wine (oinos)) is a love of wine. In the strictest sense, oenophilia describes a disciplined devotion to wine, accompanying strict traditions of consumption and appreciation. In a general sense however, oenophilia simply refers to the enjoyment of wine, often by laymen. Oenophiles are also known as wine aficionados or connoisseurs. They are people who appreciate or collect wine, particularly grape wines from certain regions, varietal types, or methods of manufacture. While most oenophiles are hobbyists, some may also be professionals like vintners, sommeliers, wine merchants, or one who tastes and grades wines for a living. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the earliest occurrence of the word oenophile was in 1865 in Culture of the Vine and Wine Making, an English translation of a French book by Jules Guyot. The word oenophilia was initially primarily used in contexts of excessive drinking, and in its earliest occurrence in 1908, spelled oinophilia. It became common in the wine lexicon in 1977 when Shirley Copperman used it for her new bring-your-own-wine restaurant she and her husband dubbed ""Oenophilia"", located on the upper West Side of Manhattan. A reviewer in a local paper, The Westsider, wrote about the debut: ""If the name suggests a rare disease you wouldn't want to catch, a sign in the window informs you that you may already have it. 'Oenophilia', it says, 'is an affliction of the senses characterized by intense cravings for good food and service and vintage wines served in a tasteful, comfortable setting at reasonable prices.'"" The reviewer from The Village Voice wrote in 1977: ""Oenophilia. No, not a social disease. It's the sensual orientation towards the pleasures of fine food and wine, and the name of a spiffy new bistro for elegant gourmandizing....'"""
"The Colmar Pocket (French: Poche de Colmar; German: Brückenkopf Elsass) was the area held in central Alsace, France, by the German Nineteenth Army from November 1944 to February 1945, against the U.S. 6th Army Group (6th AG) during World War II. It was formed when 6th AG liberated southern and northern Alsace and adjacent eastern Lorraine, but could not clear central Alsace. During Operation Nordwind in December 1944, the 19th Army attacked north out of the Pocket in support of other German forces attacking south from the Saar into northern Alsace. In late January and early February 1945, the French First Army (reinforced by the U.S. XXI Corps) cleared the Pocket of German forces."
"The Hong Kong International Wine & Spirits Fair is a trade fair organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), scheduled to be held annually with its inaugural event held in 2008 at the central location in Hong Kong of the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre.

"Interwine China, also known as China (Guangzhou) International Wine & Spirits Exhibition, is a trade show in China organized by Canton Universal Fair Group Ltd. It was founded in 2005, when the customs duty on imports of wine decreased from 40% to 14%. It is a showcase for wine and spirits production, trade, and related products and services from abroad, responding to the need of professionals in the field for a trade-fair with strong international appeal and a strict business-to-business formula. In the context of China's rapidly growing appetite for wine consumption, it is the largest international wine exhibition in China and the only wine and spirits fair approved to exhibit at the Guangzhou International Convention and Exhibition Center in Pazhou. It is dedicated entirely to the wine and spirits industry, and brings together the country's whole community of wine and spirits importers, distributors, wholesalers and retailers, along with large-scale buyers such as hotels, airlines, and restaurants. Interwine has the biggest Chinese wine importers networking in China Mainland. Over 60% of the imported wine is located in Guangdong area and still ranks the most dynamic place for a wine business with a huge quantity of importers and distributors. Interwine also organizes professional wine tastings and forums during and before the exhibition. The use to invite different wine experts to join the wine tasting summits. Interwine also organizes business-matching, promotional events and Roadshows in 40 different Chinese cities (46 cities starting from 2018). Since 2008, Interwine organizes and brings Chinese importers to visit wineries overseas. France, Spain, Italy, South Africa, Chile, Argentina, Israel, Romania, Moldova,...are these countries are continuously visited by importers thanks to Interwine. Interwine China 2013 Spring Session promoted over 50,000 different wines. Interwine China 2017 Autumn Session took place on 12-14 November at China Import and Export Fair Pazhou Complex in Guangzhou, China."
"The 1985 diethylene glycol wine scandal (German: Glykolwein-Skandal) was an incident in which several Austrian wineries illegally adulterated their wines using the toxic substance diethylene glycol (a minor ingredient in some brands of antifreeze) to make the wines appear sweeter and more full-bodied in the style of late harvest wines. Many of these Austrian wines were exported to West Germany, some of them in bulk to be bottled at large-scale West German bottling facilities. At these facilities, some Austrian wines were illegally blended into German wines by the importers, resulting in diethylene glycol ending up in some bulk-bottled West German wines as well. The scandal was uncovered by wine laboratories performing quality controls on wines sold in West Germany, and immediately made headlines around the world. The affected wines were immediately withdrawn from the market. A number of people involved in the scandal were sentenced to prison or heavy fines in Austria and West Germany. The short-term effect of the scandal was a complete collapse of Austrian wine exports and a total loss of reputation of the entire Austrian wine industry, with significant adverse effects on the reputation of German wines as well. The long-term effect was that the Austrian wine industry focused their production on other wine types than previously, primarily dry white wines instead of sweet wines, and increasingly targeted a higher market segment, but it took the Austrian wine industry over a decade to recover. Much stricter wine laws were also enacted by Austria."
"A cup-bearer was historically an officer of high rank in royal courts, whose duty was to pour and serve the drinks at the royal table. On account of the constant fear of plots and intrigues (such as poisoning), a person must have been regarded as thoroughly trustworthy to hold the position. He would guard against poison in the king's cup, and was sometimes required to swallow some of the drink before serving it. His confidential relations with the king often gave him a position of great influence. The position of cup-bearer has been greatly valued and given only to a select few throughout history. Qualifications for the job were not held lightly, but in high esteem. Holders of the position were valued for their beauty and even more for their modesty, industriousness, and courage. The cup-bearer as an honorific role, for example as the Egyptian hieroglyph for ""cup-bearer,"" was used as late as 196 BC in the Rosetta Stone for the Kanephoros cup-bearer Areia, daughter of Diogenes; each Ptolemaic Decree starting with the Decree of Canopus honored a cup-bearer. A much older role was the appointment of Sargon of Akkad as cup-bearer in the 23rd century BC."
"En primeur or ""wine futures"", is a method of purchasing wines early while the wine (a vintage) is still in the barrel. This offers the customer the opportunity to invest before the wine is bottled. Payment is made at an early stage, a year or 18 months prior to the official release of a vintage. A possible advantage of buying wines en primeur is that the wines may be considerably cheaper during the en primeur period than they will be once bottled and released to the market. However, that is not guaranteed and some wines may lose value over time. Wine experts, like Tom Stevenson, recommend buying en primeur for wines with very limited quantities and will most likely not be available when they are released.The wines most commonly offered en primeur are from Bordeaux, Burgundy, the Rhône Valley and Port, although other regions are adopting the practice."
"The Court of Master Sommeliers (CMS) is an educational organisation established in 1977 to encourage improved standards of beverage service by sommeliers, particularly in wine and food pairing. From the court's inception through 2018, a worldwide total of 274 people have earned its Master Sommelier diploma, the highest level."
"Nabīdh (Arabic: نبيذ [naˈbiːð]) is a drink traditionally made from raisins/grapes or dates steeped in water. Nabidh is non-intoxicating, but if left to steep over 96 hours, it can turn mildly intoxicating, or heavily intoxicating depending on the level of fermentation. Non-fermented (non-intoxicaing) Nabidh was one of the favorite drinks of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. He never steeped it for more than 96 hours as steeping over 96 hours ferments the drink, making it an intoxicant. Intoxicants are forbidden in Islam. Abu Hurayrah narrates of the fermented version of the drink which was refused by Muhammad: I knew that the Apostle of Allah used to keep fast. I waited for the day when he did not fast to present him the drink (nabidh) which I made in a pumpkin. I then brought it to him while it fermented. He said: Throw it by this wall, for this is a drink of the one who does not believe in Allah and the Last Day. Nabidh is known to increase alcoholic content to intoxication levels after two to three days, depending on the surrounding conditions. Non-fermented Nabidh is permissible to drink and a sunnah. According to the hadith collection by Imam Malik Ibn Anas, it is forbidden to ""prepare nabidh in a gourd or in a jug smeared with pitch."" Rufus of Ephesus (fl. 100 AD) wrote a tract on the beverage nabīdh, which Qusta ibn Luqa in his times translated into Arabic by the name Risālah fī al-Nabīdh. In 2007, after collecting and collating copies of this manuscript from different libraries across the world, Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman again reintroduced and published this rare work in Urdu and Arabic. Arab writer Ibn Fadlan describes an encounter on the Volga with a people he calls ""Rūsiyyah,"" who may have been either Russians or Vikings. He relates how the Rusiyyah would drink an alcoholic drink he refers to by the name ""nabidh"". It is not clear what drink it actually was, but from context it is clear that it was intoxicating. In Modern Standard Arabic the meaning of nabidh has shifted to mean wine in general, replacing the Classical Arabic word for wine, khamr."
"The Battle of Wissembourg or Battle of Weissenburg, the first of the Franco-Prussian War, was joined when three German army corps surprised the small French garrison at Wissembourg on 4 August 1870. The defenders, greatly outnumbered, fought stubbornly ""especially considering they were surprised and greatly outnumbered, that the French sustained their old renown as fighting men and that the first defeat, although severe, reflected no discredit on the soldiers of the 1st Corps."" The fall of Wissembourg allowed the Prussian army to move into France and compelled Marshal Mac-Mahon to give battle, and suffer defeat, at the Battle of Wörth on 6 August."
"The Battle of Mulhouse (German: Mülhausen), also called the Battle of Alsace (French: Bataille d'Alsace), which began on 7 August 1914, was the opening attack of the First World War by the French Army against Germany. The battle was part of a French attempt to recover the province of Alsace, which France had ceded to the new German Empire following defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871. The French occupied Mulhouse on 8 August and were then forced out by German counter-attacks on 10 August. The French retired to Belfort, where General , the VII Corps commander, was sacked along with the commander of the 8th Cavalry Division. Events further north led to the German XIV and XV corps being moved away from Belfort and a second French offensive by the French VII Corps, reinforced and renamed the French Army of Alsace (General Paul Pau), began on 14 August. During the Battle of Lorraine, the principal French offensive by the First and Second armies, the Army of Alsace advanced cautiously into the border province of Lorraine (Lothringen). The French reached the area west of Mulhouse by 16 August and fought their way into the city by 19 August. The German survivors were pursued eastwards over the Rhine and the French took 3,000 prisoners. Joffre ordered the offensive to continue but by 23 August, preparations were halted as news of the French defeats in Lorraine and the Ardennes arrived. On 26 August, the French withdrew from Mulhouse to a more defensible line near Altkirch, to provide reinforcements for the French armies closer to Paris. The Army of Alsace was disbanded, the VII Corps was transferred to the Somme area in Picardy and the 8th Cavalry Division was attached to the First Army, to which two more divisions were sent later. The German 7th Army took part in the counter-offensive in Lorraine with the German 6th Army and in early September was transferred to the Aisne."
"Malbec World Day is an annual observance celebrated on April 17, to commemorate the day on which President Domingo Faustino Sarmiento of Argentina officially made it his mission to transform Argentina's wine industry. On April 17, 1853, Sarmiento tasked , a French soil expert, to bring new vines to Argentina. Among the varietals Pouget brought was Malbec. Pouget continued experimenting with the adaptation of French varietals to Argentina's diverse terroirs. A decade later, the Great French Wine Blight affected the Rhône region. The name ""Malbec World Day"" translates from the Spanish ""Día Mundial del Malbec,"" meaning ""Malbec throughout the world"". The name stuck and continues to confuse English speakers to this day, as most refer to it ""World Malbec Day"" or ""Malbec Mondo"" for those who like the alliteration. In the meantime, Malbec flourished in Argentina, creating wines widely superior to those of its country of origin. Many decades later, in 1956, France faced another obstacle when a freeze wiped out the majority of Malbec vineyards. In the following years, specifically during the 1990s, Argentina positioned Malbec as their star varietal. More than 10,000 acres were planted and it became the undeniable leader of the country's exportations. Wine lovers around the world, especially in the United States, discovered and praised Argentine Malbec."
"Brunellopoli is the name given by Italian press for a scandal involving producers of Brunello di Montalcino under suspicion of wine fraud, first reported by Italian wine journalist Franco Ziliani and American wine critic James Suckling of Wine Spectator. The name ""Brunellopoli"" bears reference to Tangentopoli, or ""Bribesville"", the Italian political scandal of the 1990s, while some English language reporters have applied the name ""Brunellogate""."
"Wine Australia is an Australian Government statutory corporation that promotes and regulates the Australian wine industry. It was created as the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation (AWBC) in 1981 to replace the Australian Wine Board by the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980, and had its name changed by the amended Wine Corporation Act 1980, passed in December 2010. Wine Australia is now governed by the superseding law, Wine Australia Act 2013. Wine Australia determines the boundaries of Australia's wine regions and sometimes names them. Wine Australia also regulates wine exports, ensuring the quality and integrity of each shipment of wine exported. Wine Australia has three main departments; Compliance, Market Development and Knowledge Development. Wine Australia has its headquarters in Adelaide."
"The New Jersey Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (Division of ABC or, simply, ABC) is an agency of the government of the state of New Jersey that regulates commerce in alcoholic beverages in that state. The 21st Amendment to the United States Constitution, which ended the Prohibition, permitted the states to regulate matters related to alcohol. Immediately upon the end of Prohibition in 1933, New Jersey instituted the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, codified as ""Title 33 Intoxicating Liquors"" of the New Jersey Statutes, which established the state ABC. These laws are expanded through administrative regulations in Title 13, Chapter 2 of the New Jersey Administrative Code. After New Jersey's 1947 Constitution was adopted and some departments were consolidated, the department was incorporated into the Division of Law and Public Safety under the New Jersey Attorney General's office. The Division of ABC is headed by a Director, who is appointed by the Governor of New Jersey with the advice and consent of the State Senate. Investigations of violations of the ABC law are conducted by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Enforcement Unit in the Division of State Police which, like the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control, is within the New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety under the state attorney general. In June 2017, State Assemblyman Dave Rible was nominated by Governor Chris Christie to head the department. Rible was confirmed to the position of Director by the State Senate and appointed the following month."
"Board of State Viticultural Commissioners was established in 1880 in the U.S. state of California. The board's office was located 526 Montgomery Street, San Francisco."
"The Institut national de l'origine et de la qualité (previously Institut National des Appellations d'Origine) (INAO) is the French organization charged with regulating French agricultural products with Protected Designations of Origin (PDOs). Controlled by the French government, it forms part of the Ministry of Agriculture. The organization was co-founded by Châteauneuf-du-Pape producer Baron Pierre Le Roy. Every Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC), the French term for PDOs, is produced according to rules codified by the INAO. Because its primary purpose is to regulate the use of noteworthy names, one of its primary tasks is to delimit the geographic area entitled to produce a product. For wine this means vineyards, but the INAO also regulates the places of processing and aging. The INAO, like many organizations charged with regulating and helping producers, is often put in a contradictory position. An individual farmer may want his farm to be included in the limited area, but that might have the effect of diluting the average quality of the area. Rarely is this without controversy, and it is a delicate balancing act."
"New Jersey is home to the most complex alcohol laws in the United States. They provide 29 liquor licenses to wholesalers, manufacturers, retailers and the general public. New Jersey is the only other state, other than Wisconsin, to consider a DUI or DWI a minor traffic offense. Alcohol is also allowed on public transportation, making it more accessible to the public.In addition to granting local governments wide latitude over liquor sales, New Jersey law has some other unusual features. Corporations are limited to two retail distribution licenses, making it impractical for chain stores to sell alcoholic beverages; this restriction, in conjunction with municipal ordinances, severely limits supermarket and convenience store chains from selling beer as they do in many other states. State law treats drunk driving as a traffic offense rather than a crime, and permits individual municipalities to define the scope of underage drinking laws. New Jersey has a strong tradition of municipal home rule. Local municipalities thus have considerable authority in the licensing and regulating of alcohol-related businesses. These powers include: limiting the number of licenses to sell alcoholic beverages at retail (Class C licenses),limiting the hours of retail alcohol sales,prohibiting the retail sale of alcoholic beverages on Sunday,regulating the conduct of any retail establishment licensed to sell alcoholic beverages,regulating the nature and condition of the licensed premiseslimiting persons within the municipality to a single liquor license,limiting a license to cover only the specific licensed premises; andallowing municipalities with populations of 15,000 or more to appoint a municipal alcoholic beverage control board of three persons with terms for three years.[22] The New Jersey Wine Industry Advisory Council was created in 1985 in accordance with New Jersey Statutes (N.J.S.A 4:10-77(c)) The duties of the advisory council are ""to assess the condition of the wine industry and to advise the Secretary of Agriculture on expenditures for research, development, and promotion of the New Jersey wine industry from the New Jersey Wine Promotion Fund.""(N.J.S.A 4:10-77(c)) New Jersey's wine production industry has experienced significant growth from seven small wineries to 48 (as of 2014) since the passage of the 1981 New Jersey Farm Winery Act. The act initiated the repeal of Prohibition-era alcoholic beverage control laws that severely constrained the industry for fifty years. The council has eight members who serve for terms of three years. Two of the council's members are appointed by virtue of their positions in the State Government (i.e. the state Secretary of Agriculture, and the Commissioner of Commerce, Energy and Economic Development) and one (i.e. the Dean of Cook College at Rutgers University) because of his or her position at the state's sole land grant university under the Morrill Act of 1862. Cook College, named for nineteenth-century professor George Hammell Cook was previously known as the Rutgers Scientific School and College of Agriculture and is home to the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station and Cooperative Extension Service. In 2007, Cook College—a residential college at Rutgers with a focus on agriculture and specializes in environmental science, animal science and other life sciences—was reorganized as the ""School of Environmental and Biological Sciences"" (SEBS). The remaining five members are appointed from the general public by the State Board of Agriculture—two of whom shall be holders of a plenary winery license, two of whom shall be holders of a farm winery license and one of whom shall be a viticulturist (N.J.S.A 4:10-77(a)). New Jersey is one of only two states (along with Wisconsin) that classify DUI as a traffic violation, and not a criminal offense, except in cases of serious injury or death.[169] Because it is not a criminal offense, those charged in New Jersey with DUI and related offenses are not fingerprinted, do not have the right to a jury trial, DUI arrests and convictions are not submitted to the FBI's NCIC criminal database, and DUI arrests and convictions cannot be expunged. Statutory criminal defenses (e.g. duress, entrapment) are not available for DUI, and in State v. Hammond, the state Supreme Court upheld the conviction of a person who drove after unknowingly having his drink spiked with alcohol. Common-law criminal defenses are available in DUI cases, and a state appellate court reversed the conviction of a person who drove while intoxicated in order to escape assailants, citing the doctrine of necessity. As of 2013, the eight current members of New Jersey Wine Industry Advisory Council are: 
* Jack Tomasello, Tomasello Winery (Council Chairman) 
* Anthony Valenzano, Valenzano Winery 
* Janet Giunco, Four JG's Orchards & Vineyards 
* Ollie Tomasello, Tomasello Winery 
* William Heritage, Heritage Vineyards 
* Douglas H. Fisher, New Jersey Secretary of Agriculture (2009–present) 
* (Commissioner of Commerce, Energy and Economic Development) 
* Robert M. Goodman, Dean, School of Environmental and Biological Sciences, Rutgers University The council is required to meet twice each year, and may meet for additional sessions if necessary (N.J.S.A 4:10-77(b))."
"The Oregon Wine Board (OWB) is a semi-independent agency of the government of the U.S. state of Oregon that promotes development of the wine industry within the state, and coordinates both domestic and export marketing efforts for the industry. The nine-member board is appointed by the Governor of Oregon, is supported financially by a tax on wine grapes produced in the state and the sale of Oregon wines in the state. The taxes are collected on its behalf by the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC), and receives administrative support from the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services. Having no regulatory authority, it recommends labelling standards for wines grown and bottled within the state to the OLCC. OWB was formed in 2003 by the Oregon Legislative Assembly to replace the Oregon Wine Advisory Board of the Oregon Department of Agriculture. The restructuring was part of Governor Ted Kulongoski's initiative to improve Oregon's economy through partnerships between the public and private sectors to better promote the state's products and tourism. After signing the bill creating OWB into law, he appointed vineyard and winery owners to all nine positions on the board. The newly constituted agency's position independent of the agriculture department permitted it to expand its budget through private sources, and recruit an executive director unhampered by agency salary caps. The OWB and its sister organization the Oregon Winegrowers Association (OWA) have offices in Portland. Tom Danowski was appointed executive director of both organizations by the board in December 2011."
"Ampelography (ἄμπελος, ""vine"" + γράφος, ""writing"") is the field of botany concerned with the identification and classification of grapevines, Vitis spp. Traditionally this has been done by comparing the shape and colour of the vine leaves and grape berries; more recently the study of vines has been revolutionised by DNA fingerprinting."
"Dead arm, sometimes grape canker, is a disease of grapes caused by a deep-seated wood rot of the arms or trunk of the grapevine. As the disease progresses over several years, one or more arms may die, hence the name ""dead arm"". Eventually the whole vine will die. In the 1970s, dead-arm was identified as really being two diseases, caused by two different fungi, Eutypa lata and Phomopsis viticola (syn. Cryptosporella viticola)."
"Quality Wines Produced in Specified Regions (often abbreviated to QWpsr or simply ""quality wines"") is a quality indicator used within European Union wine regulations. The QWpsr category identifies wines with protected geographical indications. The European Union regulates and defines the status of ""quality wines"" according to production method, management and geographical location. Its original, fundamental role is in differentiating quality wines from table wines, broadly in line with the system traditionally employed by the French government, amended to account for the preferences and methodology of Italian and German growers, among others in the EU."
"Winemaking in Bordeaux is the collection of processes used to make Bordeaux wine. Winemaking in Bordeaux differs from winemaking in other places both because of the Bordelais climate and because of the particular Bordeaux style which the wine-maker is aiming for. A large number of processes are involved: pruning, training, spraying, (green harvesting), harvesting, (sorting), (de-stemming), crushing, fermentation, pressing, barrel-ageing, blending, bottling and bottle-ageing."
"Fruit wines are fermented alcoholic beverages made from a variety of base ingredients (other than grapes); they may also have additional flavors taken from fruits, flowers, and herbs. This definition is sometimes broadened to include any fermented alcoholic beverage except beer. For historical reasons, mead, cider, and perry are also excluded from the definition of fruit wine. Fruit wines have traditionally been popular with home winemakers and in areas with cool climates such as North America and Scandinavia; in East Africa, India, and the Philippines, wine is made from bananas."
"Pommeau is an alcoholic drink made in north-western France by mixing apple juice with apple brandy: Calvados in Normandy (Pommeau de Normandie) or lambig in Brittany (Pommeau de Bretagne). Considered a mistelle, it is generally consumed as an apéritif, or as an accompaniment to melon or blue cheese. It is also popular with a variety of desserts, including any chocolate or apple-based dishes."
"Pallidol is a resveratrol dimer. It can be found in red wine, in Cissus pallida or in Parthenocissus laetevirens."
"Shaoxing wine (Shaohing, Shaoshing) is one of the most famous varieties of huangjiu, or traditional Chinese wines, fermented from rice. It originates from the region of Shaoxing, in the Zhejiang province of eastern China. It is widely used as both a beverage and a cooking wine in Chinese cuisine. It is internationally well known and renowned throughout mainland China, as well as in Taiwan and Southeast Asia."
"The Raymond Massey is a cocktail made of rye, ginger syrup, and champagne. The drink’s namesake is Canadian actor Raymond Massey (1896–1983), and the beverage is predominantly consumed in his hometown of Toronto, Ontario. Ginger syrup can be prepared in advance much as simple syrup, but with the inclusion of ¾ cup of peeled and sliced ginger."
"Ochsenblut (ox blood) is a champagne and burgundy cocktail from Königsberg. It was mixed at the no longer existent Blutgericht pub. The name ""Ochsenblut"" came from both the deep red colour of the drink, reminiscent of the colour oxblood, and the name of the Blutgericht pub (""blood court"" – the pub being located under the regional court in Königsberg Castle) where it was served."
"The Negroni is a popular Italian cocktail, made of one part gin, one part vermouth rosso (red, semi-sweet), and one part Campari, garnished with orange peel. It is considered an apéritif. A traditionally made Negroni is stirred, not shaken, and built over ice in an old-fashioned or rocks glass and garnished with a slice of orange. Outside of Italy an orange peel is often used in place of an orange slice."
"A Manhattan is a cocktail made with whiskey, sweet vermouth, and bitters. While rye is the traditional whiskey of choice, other commonly used whiskies include Canadian whisky, bourbon, blended whiskey, and Tennessee whiskey. The cocktail is usually stirred then strained into a cocktail glass and garnished traditionally with a maraschino cherry. A Manhattan may also be served on the rocks in a lowball glass. The whiskey-based Manhattan is one of five cocktails named for a New York City borough. It is closely related to the Brooklyn cocktail, which uses dry vermouth and Maraschino liqueur in place of the Manhattan's sweet vermouth, and Amer Picon in place of the Manhattan's angostura bitters. The Manhattan is one of six basic drinks listed in David A. Embury's 1948 classic The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks."
"The Rob Roy is a cocktail consisting primarily of whisky and vermouth, created in 1894 by a bartender at the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan, New York City. The drink was named in honor of the premiere of Rob Roy, an operetta by composer Reginald De Koven and lyricist Harry B. Smith loosely based upon Scottish folk hero Rob Roy MacGregor. A Rob Roy is similar to a Manhattan, but is made exclusively with Scotch whisky, while the Manhattan is traditionally made with rye and today commonly made with bourbon or Canadian whisky. Like the Manhattan, the Rob Roy can be made ""sweet"", ""dry"", or ""perfect"". The standard Rob Roy is the sweet version, made with sweet vermouth, so there is no need to specify a ""sweet"" Rob Roy when ordering. A ""dry"" Rob Roy is made by replacing the sweet vermouth with dry vermouth. A ""perfect"" Rob Roy is made with equal parts sweet and dry vermouth. The Rob Roy includes a dash of Angostura bitters (mostly for color), and is usually served in a cocktail glass garnished with two maraschino cherries on a skewer (for the standard version), or a lemon twist (for the perfect and dry versions)."
"The Americano is an IBA official cocktail composed of Campari, sweet vermouth, and for the sparkling version, club soda and garnished with a slice of lemon. The cocktail was first served in creator Gaspare Campari's bar, Caffè Campari, in the 1860s. It is the direct descendant of the ""Milano-Torino"" which consisted of Campari, the bitter liqueur from Milan (Milano) and Punt e Mes, the vermouth from Turin (Torino) but lacked soda water. This drink was itself a descendant of the ""Torino-Milano"", a concoction consisting of equal parts Campari and Amaro Cora."
"The martini is a cocktail made with gin and vermouth, and garnished with an olive or a lemon twist. Over the years, the martini has become one of the best-known mixed alcoholic beverages. H. L. Mencken called the martini ""the only American invention as perfect as the sonnet"", and E. B. White called it ""the elixir of quietude""."
"Coca wine is an alcoholic beverage combining wine with cocaine. One popular brand was Vin Mariani, developed in 1863 by French-Corsican chemist and entrepreneur Angelo Mariani. At the end of the 19th century, the fear of drug abuse made coca-based drinks less popular. This led to the prohibition of cocaine in the United States in 1914 via the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act, and the removal of cocaine from coca wine, though coca leaf remained. Coca wine itself became illegal in the United States when its other main drug, alcohol, was banned just a few years later with Eighteenth Amendment in 1920.

"The Corpse Reviver family of named cocktails are sometimes drunk as alcoholic hangover ""cures"", of potency or characteristics to tongue in cheek be able to revive even a dead person. Some Corpse Reviver cocktail recipes have been lost to time, but several variations commonly thought of with ties to the American Bar at the Savoy Hotel remain, especially those espoused by Harry Craddock that originally date back to at least 1930 and are still being made. Many ""reviver"" variations exist and the word is sometimes used as a generic moniker for any morning after cocktail."
"Death in the Afternoon, also called the Hemingway or the Hemingway Champagne, is a cocktail made up of absinthe and Champagne, invented by Ernest Hemingway. The cocktail shares a name with Hemingway's 1932 book Death in the Afternoon, and the recipe was published in So Red the Nose, or Breath in the Afternoon, a 1935 cocktail book with contributions from famous authors. Hemingway's original instructions were: ""Pour one jigger absinthe into a Champagne glass. Add iced Champagne until it attains the proper opalescent milkiness. Drink three to five of these slowly."" It is claimed that the cocktail was invented by Hemingway after he spent time in the Left Bank, Paris, and enjoyed the absinthe there. The original printed recipe for the drink claimed that it was invented ""by the author and three officers of H.M.S. Danae after having spent seven hours overboard trying to get Capt. Bra Saunders’ fishing boat off a bank where she had gone with us in a N.W. gale."" Death in the Afternoon is known for both its decadence and its high strength. There are a number of alternative ways to produce Death in the Afternoon. The absinthe can be added to the glass after the Champagne, as some brands of absinthe will float on the Champagne for a short time. Other alternatives have arisen because of the difficulty of acquiring absinthe; the absinthe can be replaced with Absente, an alternative to absinthe available where it is illegal, or a strong pastis, such as Pernod. Variants which use an alternative to absinthe are sometimes given a different name, but are also sometimes still referred to as Death in the Afternoon. Some recipes direct the person making the cocktail to use ingredients in addition to the Champagne and absinthe; Valerie Mellma recommends that a sugar cube and several dashes of bitters be added to the glass prior to the main ingredients. The cocktail is milky in appearance on account of the spontaneous emulsification of the absinthe (or substitute), and bubbly, which it takes from the Champagne. After the first sip, however, it becomes significantly less bubbly. Harold McGee, dining and wine writer for The New York Times, said that it ""seemed a waste of effervescence"" (though substituting Pernod for the absinthe)."
"The boulevardier cocktail is an alcoholic drink composed of whiskey, sweet vermouth, and Campari. Its creation is ascribed to , an American-born writer who founded a monthly magazine in Paris called Boulevardier, which appeared from 1927 to 1932. The boulevardier is similar to a Negroni, sharing two of its three ingredients. It is differentiated by its use of bourbon whiskey or rye whiskey as its principal component instead of gin. Paul Clark, writing for the food blog Serious Eats, says, ""This isn't a Negroni. It is, however, the Negroni's long-lost autumnal cousin."" He continued: A simple substitution? Hardly. The bittersweet interplay between Campari and vermouth remains, but the whiskey changes the storyline. Where the Negroni is crisp and lean, the Boulevardier is rich and intriguing. There's a small difference in the preparation, but the result is absolutely stunning. Recipes vary the proportions of its components. Some boulevardier recipes call for 1+1/2 parts rather than 1 part whiskey, or call for two parts bourbon to one part vermouth and one part Campari."
"A Harlem Mugger is an alcoholic cocktail usually made with 1/2 oz vodka, 1/2 oz gin, 1/2 oz white rum, 1/2 oz tequila, 3 oz Champagne and topped with cranberry juice. It is normally served straight up and garnished with a wedge of lime. Called a Harlem Mugger because ""it takes your money and kicks your head in!"""
"French 75 is a cocktail made from gin, champagne, lemon juice, and sugar. It is also called a 75 Cocktail, or in French simply a Soixante Quinze (Seventy Five). The drink dates to World War I, and an early form was created in 1915 at the New York Bar in Paris—later Harry's New York Bar—by barman Harry MacElhone. The combination was said to have such a kick that it felt like being shelled with the powerful French 75mm field gun."
"The Ritz Fizz was created as the Ritz-Carlton hotel chain's signature cocktail in 1934 upon the repealing of prohibition in the United States. It was first concocted in the bar at The Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Boston, Massachusetts."
"A poinsettia cocktail is a mixture of champagne, Cointreau (or Triple Sec), and cranberry juice. It is named after the poinsettia flower, commonly associated with Christmas."
"The flirtini is a cocktail containing vodka, champagne and pineapple juice. The flirtini is known for being seen on Sex and the City and The Mighty Boosh. In The Mighty Boosh, it contained a twist of lime, but no vodka. A pink flirtini is made with cranberry juice and raspberries."
"Buck's Fizz is an alcoholic cocktail made of two parts sparkling wine, typically champagne, to one part orange juice. It is very similar to the Mimosa, which also contains champagne and orange juice, but in equal measures. Other sparkling wines may also be used."
"Kir Royal is a French cocktail, a variation on Kir. It consists of crème de cassis topped with champagne, rather than the white wine used in traditional Kir. This apéritif is typically served in a flute glass."
"A bijou is a mixed alcoholic drink composed of gin, vermouth, and chartreuse. This cocktail was invented by Harry Johnson, ""the father of professional bartending"", who called it bijou because it combined the colors of three jewels: gin for diamond, vermouth for ruby, and chartreuse for emerald. An original-style bijou is made stirred with ice as Johnson's 1900 New and Improved Bartender Manual states ""mix well with a spoon and serve."" This recipe is also one of the oldest in the manual, dating back to the 1890s. The bijou was popular for several decades. Unlike the Manhattan and the martini, however, the bijou disappeared after Prohibition. It was rediscovered by ""the King of Cocktails"" Dale DeGroff in the 1980s, when he stumbled upon the recipe in Johnson's book. While the original cocktail had equal parts of the three ingredients, DeGroff tripled the ratio of gin to vermouth and chartreuse to soften the taste profile. Eventually, his recipe became the standard."
"The Bronx is a cocktail. It is essentially a Perfect Martini with orange juice added. It was ranked number three in ""The World's 10 Most Famous Cocktails in 1934"" behind the Martini (#1) and the Manhattan (#2).In the movie ""The Thin Man"" 1934, the lead actor (William Powell) compared the methods for shaking the Manhattan, Bronx, And Martini."
"The Gibson is a mixed drink made with gin and dry vermouth, and often garnished with a pickled onion. In its modern incarnation, it is considered a cousin of the ubiquitous martini, distinguished mostly by garnishing with an onion instead of an olive. But the earliest recipes for a Gibson -- including the first known recipe published in 1908 -- are differentiated more by how they treat the addition of bitters. Other pre-prohibition recipes all omit bitters and none of them garnish with an onion. Some garnish with citrus twists. Others use no garniture at all. There is no known recipe for the Gibson garnished with an onion before William Boothby's 1908 Gibson Recipe. Some sources use other garnishment than the onion into the 1930s and beyond, but still none use bitters. The drink is traditionally made with gin, but the vodka Gibson is also common."
"The Hanky-Panky is a cocktail made from gin, sweet vermouth, and Fernet-Branca."
"Rose is a cocktail made of vermouth, cherry eau de vie (Kirsch) and fruit syrup (strawberry, raspberry or redcurrant). Some recipes include cherry liqueur and gin. The Rose cocktail was popular in 1920s Paris and was created by Johnny Mitta, barman at the Chatham Hotel. A recipe for it can be found in a 1927 book by Harry McElhone, owner of Harry's New York Bar in Paris."
"The El Presidente cocktail is a Cuban alcoholic drink made of rum, orange curaçao, vermouth, and grenadine. The original recipe calls for blanc vermouth. Some believe it is the only bona fide classic cocktail that is supposed to use harder to find blanc vermouth (Chambéry vermouth) and is frequently mismade with dry vermouth. While variations are made using other orange liqueurs than curaçao, the drink is traditionally meant to be red in color, so blue curaçao should not be used. The red comes from red curaçao, or when paler colors are used, from the grenadine."
"A Cheeky Vimto is an alcoholic cocktail. Served in nightclubs and bars, it is a popular drink among Britain's youth. It is also known as a D4 diesel."
"Feni (sometimes spelled fenno or fénnim or fenny) is a spirit produced in Goa, India. The two most popular types of feni are cashew feni and toddy palm feni, depending on the original ingredient; however, many other varieties are sold. The small-batch distillation of feni has a fundamental effect on its final character, which still retains some of the delicate aromatics, congeners and flavour elements of the juice from which it was produced. The word feni is derived from the Sanskrit word phena (फेन ; Konkani फेण), meaning ""froth""; this is thought to be because of the bubbles that form a light froth when the liquor is shaken in a bottle or poured into a glass. It is generally accepted that coconut feni was produced before and then followed to adapt the same procedure for distilling the exotic cashew fruit. Coconut palms are abundant along the coastline of Western India and Goa, whereas the cashew tree was an exotic species brought by the Portuguese from Brazil to India. There is ambiguity about when and who started distilling fermented juice into a spirit. The feni consumed in South Goa is generally of higher alcohol content (43-45% abv) as compared to the feni produced in North Goa. Commercially packaged feni is available at 42.8% abv."
"Perry is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented pears, similar to the way cider is made from apples. It has been common for centuries in England, particularly in the Three Counties (Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire); it is also made in parts of South Wales and France, especially Normandy and Anjou. It is also made in Commonwealth countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In more recent years, commercial perry has also been referred to as ""pear cider"", but some organisations (such as CAMRA) do not accept this as a name for the traditional drink. The National Association of Cider Makers, on the other hand, disagrees, insisting that the terms perry and pear cider are interchangeable. An over twenty-fold increase of sales of industrially manufactured ""pear cider"" produced from often imported concentrate makes the matter especially contentious."
"Huangjiu (Chinese: 黄酒), meaning yellow wine, is a Chinese alcoholic beverage, and is most popular in the Jiangnan area. Huangjiu is brewed by mixing boiled grains including rice, glutinous rice or millet with Qū as starter culture, followed by saccharification and fermentation at around 13-18 °C for fortnights. Its alcohol content is typically 8%-20%. Huangjiu is usually pasteurized, aged, and filtered before its final bottling for sale to consumers. Pasteurisation removes impurities as well as stabilising the aromatic flavour compounds. Maturation process can be complicated but important for the development of the layers of flavours and fragrance. A few brands of premium grade huangjiu could have been aged for up to 20 years. Although as huangjiu's name may suggest, its colour is typically light yellow and orange, but it can in fact range from clear to brown. Many famous huangjiu brands use the quality of water involved in the brewing process as a way of advertising, and some consider it to be the most important ingredient. Huangjiu is commonly consumed warm, as the richness from the flavour compounds are released better when warm. In summer, it is popular to drink sweet huangjiu chilled or on ice. Liaojiu (料酒) is a type of huangjiu used in cooking, an example of this being the liaojiu-type of Shaoxing rice wine. Major producers of huangjiu include mainland China and Taiwan."
"Mijiu (Chinese: 米酒; pinyin: mǐjiǔ; Wade–Giles: mi-chiu; lit. 'rice wine') is a Chinese rice wine made from glutinous rice. It is generally clear in appearance with balanced sweetness and acidity, similar to its Japanese counterpart sake and Korean counterpart cheongju. The alcohol content ranges between 15% and 20%. Rice wine was made around or before 1000 BC in ancient China, and then the practice spread to Japan and other East Asian countries. Since then, it has played an important role in Chinese life. In most Chinese supermarkets there are various kinds of rice wines. It is a traditional beverage to the Chinese and some of the families still follow the custom of making rice wine by themselves. The rice wine is made using glutinous rice, Chinese yeast and water. It is also served as an aperitif and is believed to be beneficial in improving metabolism and skin. Mijiu is usually drunk warm, like the Japanese sake and Korean cheongju, and is also used in cooking. The cooking mijiu available in Asian grocery stores are generally of a lower quality, and often contain added salt to avoid an alcohol tax. Mijiu is produced in mainland China and Taiwan. A type of baijiu called rice baijiu (Chinese: 米白酒; pinyin: mǐ báijiǔ) is distilled from mijiu. An unfiltered form of Chinese rice wine containing whole glutinous rice grains of extremely low alcoholic content and often consumed by children is called jiǔniàng (酒酿) or láozāo (醪糟). In Taiwan, the Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corporation (Monopoly Bureau) is the main manufacturer, branded as Taiwan red label. The alcohol content is 19.5%. Mijiu is commonly used in cooking dishes such as ginger duck, sesame oil chicken, and shochu chicken."
"Byrrh is an aromatised wine apéritif made of red wine, mistelle, and quinine. Created in 1866 and a trademark since 1873, it was popular as a French apéritif. With its marketing and reputation as a ""hygienic drink"", Byrrh sold well in the early 20th century. It was even exported, despite the similarity of its name to ""beer"", complicating sales in English- and German-language speaking regions. Byrrh was sold in the United States until Prohibition. As of 2012, Byrrh has been reintroduced to the United States."
"Ma La Sun (Chinese: 馬拉桑) is a brand of millet wine, originally used in Taiwanese Film director Wei Te-sheng's movie 《Cape No. 7》. The phrase ""Ma La Sun"" originally means ""drunk"" in Ami language. This product was invented and sold by Farmers' Association in Xinyi, Nantou, with an Advertising slogan ""A Thousand Years Tradition. A Brand New Taste."""
"Caribou is a sweet French-Canadian alcoholic beverage composed of red wine and a spirit (usually rye whisky) (mixed 3 parts to 1), and maple syrup or sugar. Caribou can be made at home but is now available as a premixed beverage by the Société des alcools du Québec. It can be consumed hot or cold depending on the weather and served with citrus and cinnamon in the manner of mulled wine. Cloves and nutmeg are also commonly added to flavour the drink. The drink has been traditionally served at the Quebec Winter Carnival, where it is carried around by carnival goers in hollow plastic walking canes or available at outdoor bars at the event. In recent years, it has also been served in celebration on the National holiday of Quebec. It is also a staple of the Festival du Voyageur in Winnipeg, Manitoba, where it is sometimes served in glasses made out of ice."
"Aguardiente, in Spanish, or aguardente, in Portuguese (Basque: pattar; Catalan: aiguardent; Galician: augardente) is a generic term for alcoholic beverages that contain between 29% and 60% ABV. It originates in the Iberian Peninsula (Portugal and Spain), as well as Iberian America (Spanish and Portuguese-speaking countries of the Americas)."
"Tej (from Amharic: ጠጅ, pronounced [ˈtʼədʒ]) is a honey wine, like mead, that is brewed and consumed in Ethiopia and Eritrea. It has an alcohol content generally ranging from 7 to 11%. It is often home processed and consists of three main ingredients; honey, water and a medicinal shrub called Rhamnus prinoides [gesho]. Tej is also available commercially to buy in many different types. It is generally consumed during social events such as festivals or weddings, and religious events like Ethiopian New Year [Enkutatash]. Consequently, tej forms an important part of Ethiopian society and culture and is considered the national drink of Ethiopia. It is called myes (ሜስ) in Tigrinya, and daadhi in Oromo. In Ethiopia, tej is often homemade or served at tej houses, and is often served in a flask-like pitcher or bottle, called a berele. A different beverage, berz, is Ethiopian honey water."
"Rosso Antico (""Ancient red"") is an aperitif produced in San Lazzaro di Savena, Italy. It is produced by the infusion of 32 herbs macerated in alcohol (including rosemary, thyme and sage) and then added to a mixture of 5 different types of wine. The drink is ruby-colored and has a sweet-sour flavor with notes of citrus and vanilla. Its alcohol content is 17% and is recommended for consumption as an aperitif, served plain with a slice of orange. It is sometimes used as an ingredient in a Negroni cocktail, as a substitute for Vermouth. Rosso Antico is also a name for a fancy type of marble, much used by the Romans. It is also a red stoneware body developed by Josiah Wedgwood."
"Bacardi Breezer is an alcoholic fruit-flavoured drink made by Bacardi that comes in a variety of fruit flavours: lemon, peach, pineapple, apple, ruby grapefruit, lime, orange, blackberry, watermelon, cranberry, coconut, raspberry, blueberry, pomegranate, strawberry, and mango, premixed as a cocktail with Bacardi rum, sparkling water, and added sugar. In some countries, it is also available in chocolate flavour. A number of the flavours are available in the Half Sugar range. The drink is popular in India, Europe, Israel, Canada and Australia, and is also available in China. In India, Bacardi Breezer was the first entrant in the ready to drink category and is currently the market leader in its segment. In Thailand, Breezers are actually wine coolers but still give the appearance that they contain fruits. In the UK, the Bacardi Breezer was launched in 1993 and became one of the most popular alcopops, particularly in the 1990s and 2000s, and was discontinued in 2015. A new fruit wine-based variant has been released, called Breezer Spritzed."
"Charanda is an alcoholic spirit derived from sugarcane, similar to rum. Typically the beverage is associated with the central portion of the State of Michoacán in Mexico, particularly the Purépecha-populated areas in the vicinity of the prominently agricultural City of Uruapan. Named after a hill range in the area called 'Cerro de la Charanda' where the first distillery was built in the region. Charanda is a term in Purépecha language meaning 'red-colored soil'. Obtained through the distillation and rectification (double distillation) of sugarcane cold-extracted and then fermented juices. The result is a colorless crystalline spirit. When stored and aged in oak or encino barrels the spirit acquires hues of amber. Certain tonalities of blue are seen in Premium distillations from handpicked sugarcanes when a maceration process is added. Buttery sweet in taste, similar to vanilla. It is usually served at room temperature. Charanda was granted protection with a declaration of 'Denominación de Origen Protegida' in 2003 (in English: Protected Designation of Origin or PDO), following the normatives regarding the quality of the sugarcanes used in the production, the characteristics and types of the final product, as well as the methods of extraction and production. It also norms and specifies the geographical region where the name of the spirit can be used for commercial use. Charanda comes in many brands just like any other distilled spirit. Some of the most popular are ""Tres Extra"", ""Tarasco"" (three varieties: Blanco, Reposado and Añejo -Premium-), and ""Uruapan"" (three varieties: Blanco, Plata -Premium- and Real de Uruapan -Premium-)."
"Smoking Bishop is a type of mulled wine, punch or wassail. It was especially popular in Victorian England at Christmas time and it is mentioned in Dickens' story A Christmas Carol. Smoking Bishop was made from port, red wine, lemons or Seville oranges, sugar and spices such as cloves. The citrus fruit was roasted to caramelise it and the ingredients then warmed together. There is a persistent myth that the name comes from the shape of the traditional bowl, shaped like a bishop's mitre, and that in this form, it was served in medieval guildhalls and universities. Other variations of drinks known collectively as ""ecclesiastics"" included the Smoking Archbishop (made with claret), the Smoking Beadle (made with ginger wine and raisins), the Smoking Cardinal (made with Champagne or Rhine wine) and the Smoking Pope (made with burgundy)."
"Eierpunsch (literally ""egg punch"") is the German name given to a warm, sweetened alcoholic, egg-based drink similar to egg nog. It is commonly a winter drink and can be found served in the popular Christmas markets of Germany and Austria. Eierpunsch is made with egg yolks, sugar, white wine and vanilla. Sometimes cream or custard can be added."
"A gyropalette is a piece of equipment used in the production of sparkling wine, such as Champagne, made by the traditional method, where the second fermentation takes place in the bottle."
Sparkling wine production is the method of winemaking used to produce sparkling wine. The oldest known production of sparkling wine took place in 1531 with the ancestral method.
"Dryness is a property of beverages that describes the lack of a sweet taste. This may be due to a lack of sugars, the presence of some other taste that masks sweetness, or an underabundance of simple carbohydrates that can be converted to sugar by enzymes in the mouth (amylase in particular). The term ""dry"" may be applied to types of beer, wine, distilled spirits, or any other form of alcoholic beverage. In a dry martini, ""dry"" originally referred to the inclusion of dry gin, however it is often incorrectly used to refer to the amount of vermouth used in the drink. A ""perfect"" martini – or any other cocktail that uses vermouth, such as a Perfect Manhattan – is a martini made with equal parts dry and sweet vermouth."
"Kopskiekelwein was a currant wine produced in the former German province of East Prussia. The wine was made from either blackcurrants or redcurrants, and was usually fermented with Burgundy yeast. Kopskiekelwein took its name from the jocular saying that whoever became too fond of the drink would fall down headfirst - or kopskiekel in the old Low Prussian dialect. Popular pubs where the wine was available included the forester's lodge in Moditten and the Four Brothers Inn (Vierbrüderkrug) in Metgethen, both located in the suburbs of Königsberg. Unfortunately, these establishments no longer exist, as they were destroyed during World War II."
"Choujiu is a type of Chinese fermented alcoholic beverage brewed from glutinous rice. It is very thick and has a milky white color, which is sometimes compared to jade.photo Fermentation is carried out by a combination of the fungus Aspergillus oryzae, which converts the rice starches into fermentable sugars, and yeast, which converts the sugars into alcohol. Varieties of lactic acid bacteria are also commonly present in the fermentation starter. The traditional Chinese name of the fermentation starter is qū. Choujiu is an ancient variety of Chinese alcoholic beverage. It can be traced back to the Tang Dynasty, where it was praised by the poet Li Bai. In ancient times, choujiu was referred to as láolǐ (醪醴) or yùjiāng (玉浆). In the modern day, the city of Xi'an is known particularly for its choujiu. Doburoku (どぶろく / 濁酒) is the Japanese equivalent of choujiu, and in Korea gamju and makgeolli are similar."
"Sotol is a distilled spirit of Mexican origin sourced from the family of Asparagaceae; the genus Dasylirion and several species, most commonly: Dasylirion wheeleri, Dasylirion durangense, , and Dasylirion leiophyllum, less commonly with Dasylirion texanum and Dasylirion lucidum (commonly known as Desert Spoon or, in Spanish, sotol, sereque, cucharilla, or palmilla), a plant that grows in the Chihuahuan desert of northern Mexico, New Mexico, Arizona, and west and central Texas. Sotol liquor is a Mexican drink that is known as the state spirit of Chihuahua, Durango and Coahuila. Sotol has its own appellation of origin since 2002, and may be produced only in Chihuahua, Coahuila and Durango. There are dozens of commercial examples available.Production of sotol spirits exists outside the Sotol Denomination of Origin in several regions such as Sonora, Oaxaca, and the Texas Hill Country. It is produced in a manner similar to the more common artisanal mezcals of central Mexico."
"Tepache is a fermented beverage made from the peel and the rind of pineapples, and is sweetened either with piloncillo or brown sugar, seasoned with powdered cinnamon, and served cold. Though tepache is fermented for several days, the resulting drink does not contain much alcohol. In Mexican culinary practice, the alcoholic content of tepache may be increased with a small amount of beer. In Mexico, tepache is usually sold as a chilled drink by street vendors. It is usually stored in barrels to make the fermentation process faster. It is served either in a clay mug or in a clear plastic bag with a straw inserted for easier travel. In the U.S., it is sold in juice bars or traditional Mexican restaurants in the Mexican American communities of the Southwestern United States. The fermentation process for making tepache is simple and quick, which makes tepache a drink readily produced at home."
"Jabol (Polish pronunciation: [ˈjabɔl]) is a slang name for a kind of cheap Polish fruit wine that is made from fermented fruit and is bottled at 8% to 18% alcohol by volume. Its name seems to be derived from jabłko, the Polish word for ""apple,"" which it is often made from. Though it is usually fruit flavoured, it can come in other flavours such as chocolate or mint. It comes in a variety of containers and is sold under a variety of names."
"Banana wine is a fruit wine made exclusively from bananas. It is different from banana beer, which has a long tradition and great cultural significance in East Africa. Blocker et al. (2001) wrote a chapter on ""Banana Wine"" in the book Alcohol and temperance in modern history: an international encyclopedia, though this is slightly confusing, as they define what is traditionally referred to as banana beer as being banana wine. The data they present on Production Techniques and Social Practices and Rituals relates to the latter and not to what is commonly known as banana wine. In Tanzania, banana wine is made commercially by fermenting peeled, mashed, ripe bananas. Water (to dilute the rather thick banana mash), wine yeast and sugar is added to the ""banana mash"". The traditional banana beer processing (as described in the banana beer page and in Blocker et al. (2001)) is different from commercial banana wine processing. For example, the process of making banana wine used by Banana Investment Ltd. is as follows: 1. 
* Ripe bananas are peeled and put in plastic barrels filled with water. 2. 
* The barrel contents are then pressed (mashed) and banana mash transferred to large metal pots and boiled for several hours, forming a base of juice and pulp. 3. 
* The boiled banana mash is strained and sugar added to the leftover juice and boiled again. 4. 
* The boiled juice is left to cool. 5. 
* Wine yeast is added to the cooled, sweetened banana juice and placed in plastic fermentation tanks for 15 to 20 days, depending on product. 6. 
* The fermented liquid is diluted with sterilized water, bottled and then shipped for distribution. In commercial production, ‘Cavendish’ bananas are used, while in informal production, a variety of cultivars, including both cooking and beer East African Highland bananas, ‘Pisang Awak’, ‘Gros Michel’ and apple bananas are used. Commercially produced banana wine is a clear, slightly sparkling alcoholic beverage with a longer shelf-life than banana beer, which is spoiled easily and therefore not stored for long periods. Depending on the strain of yeast and amount of sugar added, the sweetness and alcohol level in the final product is variable. Production of banana wine is mostly at a small-scale level, though attempts have been made to bring it up to industrialized production, and there are commercial producers of banana wine (e.g. Arusha-based Banana Investment Ltd). Since the early 2000s, attempts have been made to expand banana wine production to other countries where the crop is prevalent. The Philippines government has sought to expand a local banana wine industry, while India has produced both award-winning banana wines and research into expanding production."
"Falernian wine (Latin: Falernum) was produced from Aglianico grapes (and quite possibly Greco as well) on the slopes of Mount near the border of Latium and Campania, where it became the most renowned wine produced in ancient Rome; Silius Italicus attributed its origin to a mythic figure named Falernus, who lived in the late 3rd century BC. Considered a ""first growth"" or ""cult wine"" for its time, it was often mentioned in Roman literature, but has since disappeared. There were three vineyards (or appellations) recognized by Romans: Falernian from the vineyards on the highest slopes of Mount Falernus; Faustian Falernian, the most famous, from land on the central slopes corresponding to the current hilly areas of the town of Falciano del Massico and Carinola di Casanova, owned by Faustus, son of the Roman dictator Sulla; and wine from the lower slopes and plain that was simply called Falernian. The area is now occupied by the modern day vineyards of and Monte Massico."
"Passion Pop is an Australian alcoholic beverage, labelled as a carbonated ""passion flavoured"" juice-based beverage. Now an Australian icon and has been a market leader in the Flavoured Sparkling Wine category for over 30 years. Passion Pop's low price made it very popular amongst female Australian grandmothers, students and teenagers.

"The Treaty of Frankfurt (French: Traité de Francfort; German: Friede von Frankfurt) was a peace treaty signed in Frankfurt on 10 May 1871, at the end of the Franco-Prussian War."
"The Concordat in Alsace-Moselle is the part of the Local law in Alsace-Moselle relating to the official status accorded to certain religions in these territories. This Concordat is a remnant of the Napoleonic Concordat of 1801. The 1801 Concordat was abrogated in the rest of France by the law of 1905 on the separation of church and state. However, at the time, Alsace-Moselle had been annexed by Germany, so the Concordat remained in force in these areas. The Concordat recognises four religious traditions in Alsace-Moselle: three branches of Christianity (Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed) plus the Jewish religion. Therefore, the French concept of laïcité, a rigid separation of church and state, does not apply in this region. Several French governments have considered repealing the Concordat, but none have done so. On 21 February 2013, the Constitutional Council of France upheld the Concordat, reaffirming its validity, in response to an appeal from a secularist group which claimed that the Concordat in Alsace-Moselle contradicted the secular nature of the French Republic."
"The Elsässisches Fahnenlied (the ""Hymn to the Alsatian Flag"") was written by (1870-1926) in German when Alsace-Lorraine was part of the German Empire (1871-1918). It was adopted as the official anthem of Alsace-Lorraine in 1911. After World War I, the short-lived independent Republic of Alsace-Lorraine became part of France in late 1918."
"The Declaration to Protect Wine Place and Origin, commonly known as the Napa Declaration on Place, is a ""declaration of joint principles stating the importance of location to wine and the need to protect place names."" The Declaration group brings together a diverse group of wine regions from multiple continents that compete with each other in the marketplace, yet agree that protecting wine place names worldwide is key to future of the quality wine world and to avoid consumer confusion. In 2011, the Declaration group released a poll of 1000 U.S. wine consumers with the following findings: 
* 79 percent consider the region where a wine comes from an important factor when buying a bottle of wine; 
* 75 percent report they would be less likely to buy a wine if they learned that it claimed to be from a place like Champagne, Napa Valley or Oregon, but in actuality was not; 
* 84 percent think that the region a wine comes from is extremely important in determining its quality; 
* 96 percent say that consumers deserve to know that the location where wine grapes are grown is accurately stated on wine labels; and 
* 98 percent support establishing worldwide standards for all winemakers that would require that they accurately state the location where wine grapes are grown on wine labels. Support for winegrowing place name protection has also been voiced by some of the world's preeminent names in food and wine. The declaration released an open letter on October 19, 2011 signed by chefs and sommeliers lending their support for truth in wine labeling. Signatories included Thomas Keller from Per Se and the French Laundry; Ferran Adrià from El Bulli; Daniel Boulud from Daniel; Gérard Margeon from Alain Ducasse; Wolfgang Puck from Wolfgang Puck Restaurants; Antoine Hernandez from Joël Robuchon; Michel Richard from Citronelle; José Andrés from Jaleo and minibar; Pontus Elofsson from Noma; Charlie Palmer from Charlie Palmer Restaurants and many others from around the globe. The declaration was signed in July 2005 by five United States winegrowing regions and three European Union winegrowing regions. The signatory regions from the US were: 
* Napa Valley 
* Washington 
* Oregon 
* Walla Walla Valley 
* Willamette Valley The signatory regions from the EU were: 
* Champagne 
* Oporto (the region where Port wine is produced) 
* Jerez (the region where Sherry is produced) All wine regions signing the declaration pledged to work together to educate consumers about the importance of place and to protect the integrity of these names worldwide. It is the first such agreement among EU and U.S. winemakers and is seen as a step toward breaking down the ""Old World vs. New World"" focus in wine, replacing it with one that highlights greater understanding of where wine comes from all over the world. The list of signatories to the agreement expanded in March 2007 when Sonoma County, Paso Robles, Chianti Classico, Tokay, and the Australian states of Victoria and Western Australia signed the Declaration at a ceremony in Washington, D.C. In 2010, Rioja and Long Island added their signature to this effort. On March 26, 2014, Santa Barbara, Bordeaux, and Bourgogne/Chablis became the latest signatories to the movement. In addition, an invitation has been extended for winemakers from other wine-producing regions to sign onto the agreement."
"Three European Union schemes of geographical indications and traditional specialties, known as protected designation of origin (PDO), protected geographical indication (PGI), and traditional specialities guaranteed (TSG), promote and protect names of quality agricultural products and foodstuffs. Products registered under one of the three schemes may be marked with the logo for that scheme to help identify those products. The schemes are based on the legal framework provided by the EU Regulation No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 November 2012 on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs. This regulation applies within the EU as well as in Northern Ireland. Protection of the registered products is gradually expanded internationally via bilateral agreements between the EU and non-EU countries. It ensures that only products genuinely originating in that region are allowed to be identified as such in commerce. The legislation first came into force in 1992. The purpose of the law is to protect the reputation of the regional foods, promote rural and agricultural activity, help producers obtain a premium price for their authentic products, and eliminate the unfair competition and misleading of consumers by non-genuine products, which may be of inferior quality or of different flavour. Critics argue that many of the names, sought for protection by the EU, have become commonplace in trade and should not be protected. These regulation protect the names of wines, cheeses, hams, sausages, seafood, olives, olive oils, beers, balsamic vinegar, regional breads, fruits, raw meats and vegetables. Foods such as Gorgonzola, Parmigiano-Reggiano, feta, the Waterford blaas, Herve cheese, Melton Mowbray pork pies, Piave cheese, Asiago cheese, Camembert, Herefordshire cider, cognac, armagnac and champagne can only be labelled as such if they come from the designated region. To qualify as Roquefort, for example, cheese must be made from milk of a certain breed of sheep, and matured in the natural caves near the town of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon in the Aveyron region of France, where it is colonised by the fungus Penicillium roqueforti that grows in these caves. This system is similar to national appellation systems used throughout Europe, such as the appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) used in France, the denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) used in Italy, the denominação de origem controlada (DOC) used in Portugal, the denumire de origine controlată (DOC) system used in Romania and the denominación de origen (DO) system used in Spain. In many cases, the EU PDO/PGI system works parallel with the system used in the specified country, and in some cases is subordinated to the appellation system that was already instituted, particularly with wine, for example, and in France (in particular) with cheese, where for example Maroilles has both PDO (Appellation d'origine protégée (AOP) in French) and AOC classifications, but generally only the AOC classification will be shown."

"The Oxford University Wine Circle (OUWC), founded in 1962, was a wine society in the University of Oxford. The society organised frequent tastings and tasting dinners for its members and their guests. In the course of over six decades, the Wine Circle hosted many of the reference-point estates from the wine world. While the Wine Circle was a sociable group, the emphasis at meetings was on the wines themselves: as a former President, Tom Bromwich, noted: ""It's certainly not pretentious – most people, including me, have always liked wine and just want to know more about it."" Along with members of the more recently established Oxford University Wine Society and the Oxford Blind Tasting Society, members of the society often participated in blind tasting competitions. A team including members of the Wine Circle took first place in the SPIT Competition at Champagne Bollinger in April 2011. Notable former members include Jeremy Seysses of Domaine Dujac, Arabella Woodrow MW, Jasper Morris MW and Alex Hunt MW. Until the mid-2000s, the OUWC ran the Oxford blind tasting training and oversaw team selection for the Varsity Match, and there are numerous wine professionals who discovered their love and talent for tasting wine while preparing to compete against Cambridge such as: Oz Clarke and Charles Metcalfe. The Varsity Blind Tasting Match is the oldest organised blind tasting competition in the world (created by Harry Waugh in 1953); Champagne Pol Roger UK has sponsored the Match since 1992. The Wine Circle ceased to operate in 2016. The most recent Senior Member of the Society was Professor David Womersley."
"The Edmund Mach Foundation, formerly the Istituto Agrario di San Michele all’Adige (IASMA), is an agrarian institution and wine academy located in Trentino in north-east Italy. It was founded in 1874, when the Tyrolean Diet at Innsbruck decided to open an agrarian school and research station at San Michele all’Adige, with the aim of improving agricultural practice in Tyrol. The Institute has been located within the premises of former Augustinian monastery of San Michele then abandoned due to its secularization in 1807. The lombardo-venetian enologist was the academy's first director and the institute developed a reputation for work in viticulture and enology. Its mission today is to provide agricultural education, training and consultancy, and to conduct research and experimentation with the aim of ""promoting cultural and socio-economic growth in the agricultural sector and at developing the forestry and agro-alimentary systems, with particular regard for the environment and the safeguard of the territory of the Trentino region"".

"Navara rice is one of the many types of rice found in India, and is a unique grain plant in the Oryza group. It originated somewhere in Kerala, where it is regarded as endemic. In 2007–09, geographical indication status was granted. (Typically, such classification indicates an assurance of quality and distinctiveness which is primarily derived from a defined geographical region.) There seems to have been about a hundred varieties of rice but only about 20 types are said to be existing. Navara is one of the 20. The rice is often powdered and then mixed with milk and taken in the form of a cereal. Navara also has religious significance and is sometimes used in temples for ceremonies."
"Monsooned Malabar, also known as Monsoon Malabar, is a process applied to coffee beans. The harvested coffee seeds are exposed to the monsoon rain and winds for a period of about three to four months, causing the beans to swell and lose the original acidity, resulting in a flavor profile with a practically neutral pH balance. The coffee is unique to the Malabar Coast of Karnataka, Kerala and the Nilgri mountains of Tamil Nadu and has protected status under India's Geographical Indications of Goods Act. The name Monsoon Malabar is derived from exposure to the monsoon winds of the Malabar coast. The brew is heavy bodied, pungent, and considered to be dry with a musty, chocolatey aroma and notes of spice and nuts."
Ambemohar is a fragrant rice variant grown in the foothills of the Western ghats region of the state of Maharashtra in India.
"Gobindobhog (Bengali: গোবিন্দভোগ) is a rice cultivated mostly in West Bengal in India. It is a short grain, white, aromatic, sticky rice having a sweet buttery flavor. It derives its name from its usage as the principal ingredient in the preparation of the offerings to Govindaji, the family deity of the Setts of Kolkata. Gobindobhog was traditionally cultivated in the districts of Bardhaman, Hooghly, Nadia and Birbhum. Later, it began to be cultivated in Bankura and Purulia. In Bihar it is cultivated in Kaimur, and other rice bowl areas."
"Tulaipanji (Bengali: তুলাইপাঞ্জি) is an Indian rice cultivar from West Bengal, India. It is an indigenous aromatic rice grown mainly in the Raiganj subdivision of Uttar Dinajpur district and some pockets of Dakshin Dinajpur district. In 2012, the Government of West Bengal sent Tulaipanji rice to the food festival at the London Olympics. Tulaipanji is an indigenous aromatic rice landrace grown mainly in Raiganj sub-division of North Dinajpur district of West Bengal, India. The aroma and quality of this rice variety are strongly associated with its native origin. Tulaipanji is categorized as 'non-Basmati aromatic rice'. It has medium-long slender grain with an average length of 5.5 mm, length/breadth ratio of 3.4 and elongation ratio of 1.6. Cooked rice is tasty, good in texture, bright in appearance, non-sticky and friable due to high amylose content.Tulaipanji contains amylose – 28.3%, protein – 7.3%. It has comparable quality parameters like 77.1% hulling, 65% milling, 54.2% head rice recovery and alkali value at 4.0. Traditionally, Tulaipanji is grown without using any fertilizer in mid-land to high-land condition and preferably in jute harvested fields, after rainy season during the August–December period. Low soil fertility and moisture stress generally prevail in the growing field and believed to be the key factor behind the aroma. Inorganic fertilizers are generally not used due to the reduction in aroma and other qualitative parameters."

"The Gloucester Tree is a giant karri tree in the Gloucester National Park of Western Australia. At 58 metres in height, it is the world's second tallest fire-lookout tree (second only to the nearby Dave Evans Bicentennial Tree), and visitors can climb up to a platform in its upper branches for views of the surrounding karri forest. It is owned by the Shire of Manjimup. Built in 1947, the Gloucester Tree was one of eight karri trees that between 1937 and 1952 were made relatively easy to climb so that they could be used as fire lookout spots. The suitability of the tree as a fire lookout was tested by forester Jack Watson, who climbed the tree using climbing boots and a belt. It took Watson six hours to climb 58 metres, a difficult climb due to the 7.3 metre girth of the tree and the need to negotiate through limbs from 39.6 metres up. Jack Watson, a Gallipoli veteran, was also Superintendent of Kings Park in Perth, and retired from that position in 1962. Another forester, George Reynolds, pegged the ladder and lopped branches to facilitate climbing the tree, and a wooden lookout cabin was built 58 metres above the ground. The Governor-General of Australia, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, visited the site during construction, and the tree and national park are named in his honour. The wooden lookout cabin was demolished in 1973 for safety reasons, and was replaced with a steel and aluminium cabin and visitors' gallery. Currently the climb is done by stepping on 153 spikes that spiral the tree. Only 20 percent of visitors climb to the top of the tree; most make it only part of the way before turning back."

"The Fête des Vignerons (Winegrowers’ Festival) is a traditional festival which takes place in Vevey, in Switzerland. It has been organised by the Confrérie des Vignerons (Brotherhood of Winegrowers) in Vevey since 1797. The organising committee is free to choose how often the festival takes place, but the idea is that it is held once in a generation. Up to now, the interval between two festivals has varied between 14 and 28 years. The most recent festival took place in July and August 2019, 20 years after the preceding one (1999). The festival features a show celebrating the world of winemaking; performances take place in the Vevey marketplace on the shores of Lake Geneva, and other festivities are organised around the town. Since 2016, the Fête des Vignerons has been included in UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage. The 2019 edition of the festival was recommended as one of National Geographic's ""world's most exciting destinations"", one of The New York Times's ""places to go in 2019"" and was listed in The Guardian's ""Where to go in 2019"" list."
"The Route des Grands Crus (roughly, ""road of the great wines"") is the name of a tourist route situated in Burgundy, France. The approximately 60-kilometre route runs along the foot of the Côte d'Or escarpment, from Dijon in the north to Santenay in the south. Thus it runs through many of the great appellations of Burgundy wine, hence the name of the route. It takes the visitor through the vineyards of the Côte de Nuits and the Côte de Beaune and the back hills behind and above the wine slopes. It is punctuated by 33 villages or little towns, including Beaune, many of which have picturesque churches."
"Posca was an Ancient Roman drink, made by mixing vinegar, water, salt and perhaps herbs. It was the soldiers, the lower classes, and the slaves who drank posca, a drink despised by the upper class."
"The transformation of water into wine at the Marriage at Cana or Wedding at Cana is the first miracle attributed to Jesus in the Gospel of John. In the Gospel account, Jesus, his mother and his disciples are invited to a wedding, and when the wine runs out, Jesus delivers a sign of his divinity by turning water into wine. The location of Cana has been subject to debate among biblical scholars and archaeologists; multiple villages in Galilee are possible candidates."

"Grapevine yellows (GY) are diseases associated to phytoplasmas that occur in many grape growing areas worldwide and are of still increasing significance. Phytoplasmas are obligate cell wall-less bacterial pathogens (class Mollicutes), and rely on plants and homopterous phloem-sucking insects for biological dispersal. In plants, they are mainly restricted to the phloem tissue where they can move and multiply through the sieve tube elements. Almost identical symptoms of the GY syndrome are caused by different phytoplasmas and appear on leaves, shoots and clusters of grapevine. Typical symptoms include discoloration and necrosis of leaf veins and leaf blades, downward curling of leaves, lack or incomplete lignification of shoots, stunting and necrosis of shoots, abortion of inflorescences and shrivelling of berries. Those symptoms are related to callose deposition at the sieve plates and subsequent degeneration of the phloem. Although no resistant cultivars of Vitis vinifera or rootstocks are known so far, the various grape varieties differ considerably as far as symptom severity is concerned. It ranges from fast decline and death in highly susceptible cultivars to tolerant rootstocks as symptomless carriers of the pathogen. Currently, the only available control strategies include early eradication of infected crops, early eradication of infected source plants (weed control), and chemical controlof vectors through regular insecticide treatments. The main viticultural production areas in the Republic of North Macedonia were surveyed in 2006/2007/2008 for the presence of grapevine yellows. PCR and RFLP analyses were used to detect and identify phytoplasmas infecting grapevines. Only phytoplasmas associated with “bois noir” disease (ribosomal subgroup 16SrXII-A or stolbur) were detected. Molecular analyses showed that all phytoplasmas identified belonged to tuf-type II (VKII)."
"Flavescence dorée (from French ""Flavescence"" : yellowing and ""dorée"" : golden) is a phytoplasma disease of the vine with the potential to threaten vineyards. The bacterial agent has recently been named Candidatus Phytoplasma vitis, and its vector is the leafhopper, Scaphoideus titanus. Infection may kill young vines and greatly reduce the productivity of old vines. It is classified as a phytoplasma disease belonging to the group generically termed grapevine yellows. Occurrences are in sporadic epidemics, and varieties vary in their sensitivity to it. There is no cure at the moment and the way to manage its spread is by uprooting infected plants and by using selective insecticides in an area-wide pest management approach in order to reduce the hemipteran vectors."
"""Candidatus Phytoplasma solani"", the causal agent of the black wood of grapevine, is a bacterial Phytoplasma species of the 16SrXII group. The black wood of grapevine disease is classified as part of the grapevine yellows. ""Ca. Phytoplasma solani"" is also associated with the tree peony (Paeonia suffruticosa) yellows disease in China."
"The Duchy of Alsace (Latin: Ducatus Alsacensi, Ducatum Elisatium; German: Herzogtum Elsaß) was a large political subdivision of the Frankish Empire during the last century and a half of Merovingian rule. It corresponded to the territory of Alsace and was carved out of southern Austrasia in the last decade of the reign of Dagobert I, probably to stabilise the southern reaches of Austrasia against Alemannia and Burgundy. By the late Middle Ages, the region was considered part of Swabia."
"Pinard is a French term for wine (particularly red wine), popularized as the label for the ration of wine issued to French troops during the First World War. The term became wrapped up in the public conception of the poilu (""hairy one"", the typical French foot soldier) and his beloved pinard, joined in a ""cult of wine""."
"Vinogel was a dehydrated wine product, reduced to 1/3 of its volume and gelled to maintain alcohol titration. It was utilised by the French Far East Expeditionary Corps, most notably at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. It was used as late as a decade later in Africa."
"Melian Pithamphorae or Melian Amphorae are names for a type of large belly-handled amphorae, which were produced in the Archaic period in the Cyclades. On account of their shape and painted decoration in the Orientalising style, they are among the most famous Greek vases. The amphorae are dated to the seventh and early sixth centuries BC; the last of them was made in the 580s. They were used as grave markers with the same function as the later grave statues and reliefs and were dedicated as cult objects in sanctuaries. With the increasing importance of sculpture in these roles, the production of these vases came to an end."
"A Nikosthenic amphora is a type of Attic vase invented in the late 6th century BC by the potter Nikosthenes, aimed specifically for export to Etruria. Inspired by Etruscan Bucchero types, it is the characteristic product of the . Characteristic features are the angular body of the amphora and the broad flat handles. The Etruscan predecessors were black-painted, whereas the Attic vases were decorated in the black-figure style. Nearly all know examples were found in Caere, while the majority of Nikosthenes products in other shapes were discovered in Vulci. This suggests that the type was specifically made for sale in or to Caere, which indicates that Nikosthenes must have been a gifted salesman and that an efficient system of intermediate traders must have existed. Niksothenes created or introduced several vase shapes, but the Nikosthenic amphora is his most famous innovation. The clay of the Nikosthenic amphorae is bright orange-red, and thus provides a perfect base for black-figure vase painting. Their decoration follows quite varied patterns. Sometimes, they are subdivided in two or three separate friezes, mostly of plant and animal motifs. In other cases, images cover the whole vase body. Apparently most, perhaps even all, Nikosthenic amphorae were painted by N Painter, which has been suggested to be identical with Nikosthenes. Production began around 530 to 520 BC and continued under Nikosthenes' successor Pamphaios – at that stage in the red-figure style – to cease between 500 and 490 BC."
"In vino veritas, also written as in uino ueritas, is a Latin phrase that means ""In wine, there is truth"", suggesting a person under the influence of alcohol is more likely to speak their hidden thoughts and desires. The phrase is sometimes continued as, ""In vīnō vēritās, in aquā sānitās"", i.e., ""In wine there is truth, in water there is good sense (or good health)."" Similar phrases exist across cultures and languages. The expression, together with its counterpart in Greek, ""Ἐν οἴνῳ ἀλήθεια"" (En oinō alētheia), is found in Erasmus' Adagia, I.vii.17. Pliny the Elder's Naturalis historia contains an early allusion to the phrase. The Greek expression is quoted by Athenaeus of Naucratis in his Deipnosophistae; it is now traced back to a poem by Alcaeus. Herodotus asserts that if the Persians decided something while drunk, they made a rule to reconsider it when sober. Authors after Herodotus have added that if the Persians made a decision while sober, they made a rule to reconsider it when they were drunk (Histories, book 1, section 133). The Roman historian Tacitus described how the Germanic peoples kept counsel at feasts, where they believed that drunkenness prevented the participants from dissembling."
"Darjeeling tea is a tea made from Camellia sinensis var. sinensis that is grown and processed in the Darjeeling or Kalimpong Districts in West Bengal, India. Since 2004, the term Darjeeling tea has been a registered geographical indication referring to products produced on certain estates within Darjeeling and Kalimpong. The tea leaves are processed as black tea, though some estates have expanded their product offerings to include leaves suitable for making green, white and oolong teas. The tea leaves are harvested by plucking the plant's top two leaves and the bud, from March to November, a time span that is divided into four flushes. The first flush consists of the first few leaves grown after the plant's winter dormancy and produce a light floral tea with a slight astringency; this flush is also suitable for producing a white tea. Second flush leaves are harvested after the plant has been attacked by a leafhopper and the camellia tortrix so that the leaves create a tea with a distinctive muscatel aroma. The warm and wet weather of monsoon flush rapidly produces leaves but they are less flavourful and often used for blending. The autumn flush produces teas similar, but more muted, to the second flush. Tea plants were first planted in the Darjeeling region in the mid-1800s. At the time, the British were seeking an alternative supply of tea apart China and attempted growing the plant in several candidate areas in India. Both the newly discovered assamica variety and the sinensis variety were planted but the sloped drainage, cool winters and cloud cover favoured var. sinensis. The British established numerous tea plantations, with the majority of workers being Gorkhas and Lepchas from Nepal and Sikkim. After independence, the estates were all subsequently sold to businesses in India and regulated under the laws of India. The Soviet Union replaced the British as the primary consumers of tea from Darjeeling. As Darjeeling tea gained a reputation for its distinctiveness and quality, it was marketed more to Western Europe with many estates acquiring organic, biodynamic and Fairtrade certifications and the Tea Board of India pursuing authentication and international promotion of Darjeeling teas."
"Nilgiri tea is a drink made by infusing leaves of Camellia sinensis that is grown and processed in the Nilgiris district in Tamil Nadu, India. The leaves are processed as black tea, though some estates have expanded their product offerings to include leaves suitable for making green, white and oolong teas. It is generally described as being a brisk, fragrant and full-bodied tea. The region produces both rolled and crush, tear, curl tea and it is predominately used for blending. Nilgiri tea is also used for making iced tea and instant tea. Camellia sinensis var. sinensis was introduced to Nilgiri Mountains by the British in 1835 from seeds shipped from China. Commercial production commenced in the 1860s, where the industry would evolve to include a mixture of many small growers with a few large corporate estates and the government-owned Tamil Nadu Tea Plantation established for the purpose of assisting in repatriating Indian Tamils from Sri Lanka. Its fertile, soils located on well-drained slopes with geography that brings two monsoons per year with periods of fog and humid, cold weather, allow the sinensis variety to thrive. The tea is of sufficient quality and uniqueness to warrant being a registered geographical indication."
"Assam tea is a black tea named after the region of its production, Assam, India. Assam tea is manufactured specifically from the plant Camellia sinensis var. assamica (Masters). Assam tea is indigenous to Assam. Initial efforts of planting Chinese varieties in Assam soil did not succeed. Although Assam tea is now mostly grown at or near sea level and is known for its body, briskness, malty flavour, and strong, bright colour. Assam teas, or blends containing Assam, are often sold as ""breakfast"" teas. For instance, Irish breakfast tea, a maltier and stronger breakfast tea, consists of small-sized Assam tea leaves. The state of Assam is the world's largest tea-growing region by production, lying on either side of the Brahmaputra River, and bordering Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar and very close to China. This part of India experiences high rainfall; during the monsoon period, as much as 250 to 300 mm (10 to 12 in) of rain per day. The daytime temperature rises to about 36 °C (96.8 °F), creating greenhouse-like conditions of extreme humidity and heat. This tropical climate contributes to Assam's unique malty taste, a feature for which this tea is well known. Though Assam generally denotes the distinctive black teas from Assam, the region produces smaller quantities of green and white teas as well, with their own distinctive characteristics.Historically, Assam has been the second commercial tea production region after southern China, the only two regions in the world with native tea plants. The introduction of the Assam tea bush to Europe is related to Robert Bruce, a Scottish adventurer, who apparently encountered it in the year 1823. Bruce reportedly found the plant growing ""wild"" in Assam while trading in the region. Maniram Dewan directed him to the local Singpho chief Bessa Gam. Bruce noticed local people (the Singhpos) brewing tea from the leaves of the bush and arranged with the local chiefs to provide him with samples of the leaves and seeds, which he planned to have scientifically examined. Robert Bruce died shortly thereafter, without having seen the plant properly classified. It was not until the early 1830s that Robert's brother, Charles, arranged for a few leaves from the Assam tea bush to be sent to the botanical gardens in Calcutta for proper examination. There, the plant was finally identified as a variety of tea, or Camellia sinensis var assamica, but different from the Chinese version (Camellia sinensis var. sinensis)."
"Lees are deposits of dead yeast or residual yeast and other particles that precipitate, or are carried by the action of ""fining"", to the bottom of a vat of wine after fermentation and aging. The same while brewing beer at a brewery is known as trub – the same from secondary fermentation of wine and beer are the lees or equally, as to beer only, dregs. This material is the source for most commercial tartaric acid, which is used in cooking and in organic chemistry. Normally, the wine is transferred to another container (racking), leaving this sediment behind. Some wines (notably Chardonnay, Champagne, and Muscadet) are sometimes aged for a time on the lees (a process known as sur lie), leading to a distinctive yeasty aroma and taste. The lees may be stirred (French: bâtonnage) for uptake of their flavour. The lees are an important component in the making of ripasso, where the leftover lees from Amarone are used to impart more flavour and colour to partially aged Valpolicella."
"Ginger wine is a fortified wine made from a fermented blend of ground ginger root and raisins which was first produced in England. It is often fortified by being blended with brandy (especially cognac). Ginger wine can be drunk with ice (""on the rocks""), or without ice (either ""neat"" or ""straight up""), and is frequently used as an ingredient—along with whisky (typically a blended Scotch whisky)—in a ""Whisky Mac"" (the shortened form of ""Whisky Macdonald""). Ginger wine can also be served mixed with other beverages, such as lemonade, ginger ale, bitter lemon or diluted with water. Ginger wine is traditionally sold in green glass bottles, although the word ""green"" may or may not appear on the label. The first documented appearance of ginger wine occurred with the foundation of The Finsbury Distillery Company based in the City of London in 1740. The company, like other distillers, was required to build a retail network in compliance with the Gin Act 1751. Joseph Stone, a grocer on High Holborn street, central London, was one of the most prominent and important customers of the Finsbury wines division, and as such, had his name given to their ginger wine. In the 19th century, sales were boosted by a cholera epidemic and a widely held belief that ginger offered protection against the disease. Other 19th-century claims marketed it as a medicinal tonic that aided digestion and served as an effective aphrodisiac. Today, it is still produced and is widely available through most licensed premises. In the UK a ginger essence called ""Yulade"" is produced by the Co-op, and is widely used at festive times to make a non-alcoholic 'ginger wine' popular for children and teetotal households. In some instances ginger wine may be mistaken for ginger beer, which by definition contains grains. Since 2007, ginger wine has also been sold under the name ""ginger libation"" by a producer in Massachusetts, with the addition of pineapple and citrus."
"Shedeh was a drink of ancient Egypt. Although it was long thought to have been made from pomegranates, recent evidence suggests it came from red grapes. Our results definitively reveal that the ancient Egyptian highly valued Shedeh drink was a grape product, specifically made from red grapes."
"Guntur Sannam or Capsicum annuum var. longum, is a variety of chili pepper that grows in the districts of Guntur, Prakasam (Andhra Pradesh), Warangal (Telangana), and Khammam in India. It is registered as one of the geographical indications of Andhra Pradesh (pursuant to Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999)."
"The 'Ataúlfo' mango, also called young, baby, yellow, honey, Adaulfo, Adolfo, or Champagne, is a mango cultivar from Mexico. Ataulfo mangos are golden yellow and generally weigh between 6 and 10 ounces (170 and 280 g), with a somewhat sigmoid (oblong) shape and a gold-blushed yellow skin. Their buttery flesh is not fibrous, and they have a thin pit. Their flesh is a deep yellow and high in sugar (15 grams per 100-gram serving), with a rich, sweet flavor. They were named for grower Ataulfo Morales Gordillo. Since August 27, 2003, the Ataulfo mango is one of the 18 Mexican Designations of Origin."
"The Himsagar mango is a popular mango cultivar, originating in the modern-day Bangladesh and state of West Bengal in India. Widely considered as the best mangoes, the inside of Himsagar is yellow to orange in colour and does not have any fibre. The fruit is medium-sized and weighs between 250 and 350 grams, out of which the pulp content is around 77%. It has a good keeping quality. It is also known as Khirsapati. Himsagar ripens in May and it is available in the market from the second week of May to the end of June. It is mainly grown in the Chapai Nawabganj district of Bangladesh and the Malda, Murshidabad, Nadia, Hooghly districts of West Bengal, India. This cultivar is registered under the protected Geographical Indication index with G.I. Registration No. 112."
"The 'Fazli' mango is a mango cultivar primarily grown in Bangladesh. and Indian state of West Bengal. It is a late maturing fruit, available after other varieties. Fazlis are commonly used in jams and pickles in the cuisine of the Indian subcontinent. Each mango can be quite large, going up to a kilo. Rajshahi Division in Bangladesh is the major producers of fazli. An important commercial variety, it is increasingly being exported. In 2009, India has filed a Geographical Indication for the name Fazli, but this is likely to be shared with Bangladesh. There is a dispute over this issue regarding registration to the WTO manual by India."

"The Elsässische Maschinenbau-Gesellschaft Grafenstaden (Alsatian Engineering Company in Grafenstaden) was a heavy industry firm located at Grafenstaden in the Alsace, near the city of Strasbourg. In 1826, André Koechlin founded the engineering works of Andre Koechlin & Cie in Mulhouse, which made steam engines, turbines, spinning and weaving machinery and, from 1839, steam locomotives too. The subsequent history of the firm is closely linked to the history of Alsace-Lorraine. After losing the Franco-Prussian war of 1870/71, France had to withdraw from the so-called Reichsland and cede it to the German Empire. As a result, the company, now called the Elsässische Maschinenbaugesellschaft Andreas Köchlin & Cie. in Mülhausen and the Maschinenwerkstätte Rollé & Schwillgué in Strassburg-Grafenstaden found themselves inside the German Empire. In 1872 the two factories were merged into the Elsässischen Maschinenbau-Gesellschaft Grafenstaden. The scale-making factory of ""Rollé & Schwillgué"", that predominantly made decimal weighing equipment based on the 1821 patent of a Benedictine monk, was bought in 1837 by the Strasbourg engineering company, which transferred the workshop with its work force of 40 employees one year later to Grafenstaden, a few kilometres south of Strasbourg. In 1846 they began the manufacture of tenders, and from 1856 locomotives as well. After the takeover of Alsace-Lorraine by the German Empire in 1871, many Alsatians who considered themselves to be Frenchmen moved to the area around Belfort where, in 1872, the Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques (Alsatian Mechanical Engineering Company), SACM, was opened. After the peace treaty of Versailles in 1919 Alsace-Lorraine, and with it the Elsässische Maschinenbau-Gesellschaft Grafenstaden, returned to France, where the Grafenstaden firm was merged with the SACM.The factory in Belfort was worked until 1926 and taken over in 1928 by Thomson-Houston and Alsthom, the present-day firm of Alstom. After the occupation of Alsace in 1941 the factory was forced to deliver Class 44 and Class 52 locomotives to the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft under the direction of the Magdeburger Werkzeugmaschinenfabrik (Magdeburg Machine Tool Factory), MWF. After World War II the factory was once again under French control. In 1951 the first diesel locomotives were built in the factory and, in 1955, the manufacture of steam locomotives was halted. The production of diesel engines continued until 1965."

"The Confrérie des Chevaliers du Tastevin (English: Fraternity of Knights of the Wine-Tasters' Cup) is an exclusive bacchanalian fraternity of Burgundy wine connoisseurs. Originally formed under the Ancien Régime and re-established in 1934, the Chevaliers du Tastevin are based at the 12th-century château of the Clos de Vougeot in the Côte d'Or region of Burgundy, France. With Chapters worldwide, called Sous-Commanderies, in view of its Gallic heritage, the Confrérie's name and ceremonial titles are usually styled in French."
"Sugars in wine are at the heart of what makes winemaking possible. During the process of fermentation, sugars from wine grapes are broken down and converted by yeast into alcohol (ethanol) and carbon dioxide. Grapes accumulate sugars as they grow on the grapevine through the translocation of sucrose molecules that are produced by photosynthesis from the leaves. During ripening the sucrose molecules are hydrolyzed (separated) by the enzyme invertase into glucose and fructose. By the time of harvest, between 15 and 25% of the grape will be composed of simple sugars. Both glucose and fructose are six-carbon sugars but three-, four-, five- and seven-carbon sugars are also present in the grape. Not all sugars are fermentable, with sugars like the five-carbon arabinose, rhamnose and xylose still being present in the wine after fermentation. Very high sugar content will effectively kill the yeast once a certain (high) alcohol content is reached. For these reasons, no wine is ever fermented completely ""dry"" (meaning without any residual sugar). Sugar's role in dictating the final alcohol content of the wine (and such its resulting body and ""mouth-feel"") sometimes encourages winemakers to add sugar (usually sucrose) during winemaking in a process known as chaptalization solely in order to boost the alcohol content – chaptalization does not increase the sweetness of a wine."
"Dimethyl dicarbonate (DMDC) is an organic compound which is a colorless liquid with a pungent odor at high concentration at room temperature. It is primarily used as a beverage preservative, processing aid, or sterilant (INS No. 242), and acts by inhibiting the enzymes acetate kinase and L-glutamic acid decarboxylase. It has also been proposed that DMDC inhibits the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase by causing the methoxycarbonylation of their histidine components."
"ε-Viniferin is a naturally occurring phenol, belonging to the stilbenoids family. It is a resveratrol dimer. It is found in Vitis vinifera grapevines, in wines, in the Oriental medicinal plant Vitis coignetiae and in the stem bark of Dryobalanops aromatica.Cis-epsilon-viniferin can be found in Paeonia lactiflora. It shows a human cytochrome P450 enzymes inhibition activity."
"Appletiser (a play on ""appetizer"") is a sparkling fruit juice created by blending fruit juice with carbonated water. It was created in 1966 in Elgin Valley, Western Cape, South Africa, by French-Italian immigrant Edmond Lombardi. For export and out of season, the juice is concentrated by extracting the aroma and the water from it. The concentrate can then be stored in cold rooms. In South Africa, the juice is filtered and then immediately bottled, with no water being added. The concentrate can then be converted to juice by adding the water and the concentrated aroma in the original ratios. Red and White Grapetiser, Peartiser and Appletiser Colours are fruit variants. Whilst Appletiser is primarily sold in its home market of South Africa, the brand is also exported to more than 20 other countries, including the Southern African Development Community (SADC), as well as the UK, Belgium, Spain, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand."
"Proteins are present in wine. The most common proteins include thaumatin-like proteins and chitinases and have a role in the formation of turbidity (haze) especially visible in white wine. The quantity of haze forming is dependent on the quantity of phenolics in the wine. Some of those proteins are considered nuisance. Some of them are grape pathogenesis-related proteins. Those proteins have been identified by mass spectrometry and originate from grape, yeast, bacteria and fungi. These proteins are unstable when submitted to heat, and can be removed by treatment using bentonite, a process that contributes to the clarification and stabilization of wine. Proteins residues from proteinaceous fining agents such as gelatin or egg white can possibly be found in wine. Wheat gluten has also been tested, but there are health issues regarding its use because of gluten intolerance in some people."
"The phenolic content in wine refers to the phenolic compounds—natural phenol and polyphenols—in wine, which include a large group of several hundred chemical compounds that affect the taste, color and mouthfeel of wine. These compounds include phenolic acids, stilbenoids, flavonols, dihydroflavonols, anthocyanins, flavanol monomers (catechins) and flavanol polymers (proanthocyanidins). This large group of natural phenols can be broadly separated into two categories, flavonoids and non-flavonoids. Flavonoids include the anthocyanins and tannins which contribute to the color and mouthfeel of the wine. The non-flavonoids include the stilbenoids such as resveratrol and phenolic acids such as benzoic, caffeic and cinnamic acids."
Anthocyanone A is a degradation product of malvidin 3-O-glucoside under acidic conditions. It is found in wine.
"Pomace (/ˈpʌməs/ PUM-əs), or marc (/ˈmɑːrk/; from French marc [maʁ]), is the solid remains of grapes, olives, or other fruit after pressing for juice or oil. It contains the skins, pulp, seeds, and stems of the fruit. Grape pomace has traditionally been used to produce pomace brandy (such as grappa, orujo, törkölypálinka, zivania). Today, it is mostly used as fodder, as fertilizer, or for the extraction of bioactive compounds like polyphenols."
"Éva Viczay de Loós (1602 – 28 July 1651) was a Hungarian noblewoman, the second wife of Baron Pál Esterházy de Galántha, who was the founder of the Zólyom branch of the House of Esterházy. Her brother was Baron Ádám Viczay de Loós."
"Red wine headache (""RWH"") is a headache often accompanied by nausea and flushing that occurs after consuming red wine in susceptible individuals. White wine headaches have been less-commonly reported."
"The Battle of the Wines (fr. La Bataille des Vins), sometimes called ""The Battle of the Blends"" was a notable poem written by Henry d'Andeli in 1224 and tells the story of a famous wine tasting organized by the French king Philip Augustus. Over 70 samples from France and across Europe, including Cyprus, Spain and the Mosel region, were tasted and judged by an English priest. The priest classified the wines he tasted as either Celebrated for those which pleased him or Excommunicated for those that did not meet his standards. In the end a sweet wine from Cyprus (widely believed to be Commandaria) won the overall tasting and was awarded the supreme title of ""Apostle""."
"European Union wine regulations are common legislation related to wine existing within the European Union (EU), the member states of which account for almost two-thirds of the world's wine production. These regulations form a part of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of EU, and regulate such things as the maximum vineyard surface allowed to individual EU member states, allowed winemaking practices and principles for wine classification and labelling. The wine regulations exist to regulate total production in order to combat overproduction of wine and to provide an underpinning to Protected designations of origin (PDOs), among other things. In a sense, the wine regulations therefore try to protect both the producer and the consumer. The EU wine regulations, as a part of CAP, do not include regulations on age limits for buying or drinking alcohol, regulations on wine advertising or retailing and other aspects of national social or public health policies of the individual EU member states."
"A winemaking cooperative is an agricultural cooperative which is involved in winemaking, and which in a similar way to other cooperatives is owned by its members. The members in a winemaking cooperative are usually vineyard owners, who deliver grapes to the cooperative, which is involved in production of wine from the grapes and the subsequent marketing activities. Winemaking cooperatives are responsible for a significant proportion of the total wine production in many major wine-producing countries, including most of the classical European wine countries, but their importance varies much between different wine regions within these countries. Cooperatives tend to be more important in regions where the wine’s selling price is relatively low and average size of vineyard holdings is small. While some winemaking cooperatives were established in the 19th century, the majority were established in the early 1930s following the Great Depression."
"The French paradox is a catchphrase first used in the late 1980s, that summarizes the apparently paradoxical epidemiological observation that French people have a relatively low incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD), while having a diet relatively rich in saturated fats, in apparent contradiction to the widely held belief that the high consumption of such fats is a risk factor for CHD. The paradox is that if the thesis linking saturated fats to CHD is valid, the French ought to have a higher rate of CHD than comparable countries where the per capita consumption of such fats is lower. It has also been suggested that the French paradox is an illusion, created in part by differences in the way that French authorities collect health statistics, as compared to other countries, and in part by the long-term effects, in the coronary health of French citizens, of changes in dietary patterns which were adopted years earlier."

"Madhubani Art (or Mithila painting) is a style of Indian painting, practiced in the Mithila region of the Indian subcontinent. This painting is done with a variety of tools, including fingers, twigs, brushes, nib-pens, and matchsticks and using natural dyes and pigments. It is characterised by its eye-catching geometrical patterns. There is ritual content for particular occasions, such as birth or marriage, and festivals, such as Holi, Surya Shasti, Kali Puja, Upanayana, and Durga Puja. Madhubani painting (Mithila painting) was traditionally created by the women of various communities in the Mithila region of the Indian subcontinent. It originated from Madhubani district of the Mithila region of Bihar. Madhubani is also a major export center of these paintings. This painting as a form of wall art was practiced widely throughout the region; the more recent development of painting on paper and canvas mainly originated among the villages around Madhubani, and it is these latter developments that led to the term ""Madhubani art"" being used alongside ""Mithila Painting."" The paintings were traditionally done on freshly plastered mud walls and floors of huts, but now they are also done on cloth, handmade paper and canvas. Madhubani paintings are made from the paste of powdered rice. Madhubani painting has remained confined to a compact geographical area and the skills have been passed on through centuries, the content and the style have largely remained the same. Thus, Madhubani painting has received GI (Geographical Indication) status. Madhubani paintings use two-dimensional imagery, and the colors used are derived from plants. Ochre, Lampblack and Red are used for reddish-brown and black, respectively. Madhubani paintings mostly depict people and their association with nature and scenes and deities from the ancient epics. Natural objects like the sun, the moon, and religious plants like tulsi are also widely painted, along with scenes from the royal court and social events like weddings. Generally, no space is left empty; the gaps are filled by paintings of flowers, animals, birds, and even geometric designs. Traditionally, painting was one of the skills that was passed down from generation to generation in the families of the Mithila Region, mainly by women. It is still practiced and kept alive in institutions spread across the Mithila region. in Darbhanga, Vaidehi in Madhubani, Benipatti in Madhubani district and Gram Vikas Parishad in Ranti are some of the major centres of Madhubani painting which have kept this ancient art form alive."
"The International Standard Wine Number or ISWN, similar to the ISBN for books, was a coding scheme intended to give a unique identifier for each wine worldwide. The ISWN system had a consistent unique code for each wine producer (ISWN-P), each wine brand or product (ISWN-W), each vintage variant of a wine product (ISWN-V), and the bottle variants (ISWN-B). The ISWN was allocated by the ISWN Organization on the basis of a global reference database of wine producers and wines worldwide. The database was improved through wine producers updating their own data with the ISWN Manager module. The ISWN Organization was a Non-profit organization sponsored by the wine industry."

"Mysore Sandal Soap is a brand of soap manufactured by the Karnataka Soaps and Detergents Limited (KSDL), a company owned by the government of Karnataka in India. This soap has been manufactured since 1916, when Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV, the king of Mysore, set up the Government Soap Factory in Bangalore. The main motivation for setting up the factory was the excessive sandalwood reserves that the Mysore Kingdom had, which could not be exported to Europe because of the First World War. In 1980, KSDL was incorporated as a company by merging the Government Soap Factory with the sandalwood oil factories at Shimoga and Mysore. Mysore Sandal Soap is the only soap in the world made from 100% pure sandalwood oil. KSDL owns a proprietary geographical indication tag on the soap, which gives it intellectual property rights to use the brand name, to ensure quality, and to prevent piracy and unauthorised use by other manufacturers. In 2006, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the Indian cricketer was selected as the first brand ambassador of the Mysore Sandal Soap."

"Phulkari (Punjabi: ਫੁਲਕਾਰੀ) refers to the folk embroidery of the Punjab. Although Phulkari means floral work, the designs include not only flowers but also cover motifs and geometrical shapes. The main characteristics of Phulkari embroidery are use of darn stitch on the wrong side of coarse cotton cloth with coloured silken thread. Punjabi women create innumerable alluring and interesting designs and patterns by their skilful manipulation of the darn stitch. According to Kehal (2009), a cloth where only a few flowers are embroidered is called a Phulkari. The other types are distinct varieties. The traditional varieties of Phulkaris are large items of cloth and include Chope, Tilpatr, Neelak and Bagh. Sometimes, the Bagh is given separate categorization of its own as on other varieties of a Phulkari, parts of the cloth is visible, whereas in a Bagh, the embroidery covers the entire garment so that the base cloth is not visible. Further, in contemporary modern designs, simple and sparsely embroidered dupattas (long scarf), odhinis (oversized long scarf), and shawls, made for everyday use, are referred to as phulkaris, whereas clothing items that cover the entire body, made for special and ceremonial occasions such as weddings are called baghs (large garden). The Phulkari continues to be an integral part of Punjabi weddings to the present day. The craft of Phulkari has undergone changes over the centuries. According to Pal (1960) in his seminal essay on the history and use of the Phulkari published by Patiala University, the traditional method of embroidering a Phulkari and its widespread use in Punjab, India declined by the 1950s. Traditionally, women would embroider Phulkaris without using stencils. Pal (1960) states that women would clean their courtyards and invite friends and family to ceremonially begin the process of embroidering a Phulkari. Folk songs would be sung on this occasion. ""Ih Phulkari Meri Maan Ne Kadhi/ Is Noo Ghut Ghut Japhiyan Paawan"" (This Phulkari was embroidered by my mother, I embrace it warmly). Folk songs like these are indicative of the emotional attachment the girl had to the Phulkari embroidered by her mother or grandmother, or aunts. According to Blurton (2003), ""angular satin-stitch baghs (shawls) and phulkaris (shawls similar to baghs, but less heavily embroidered)"" up to 20 pieces would form part of a brides dowry. The items would be gifted by the bride's father, uncles and mother-in-law. Blurton further states that it took many years for the baghs and phulkaris to be embroidered. Traditionally women would begin to embroider the bhagh when their grandsons were born to be give to their future brides. Accordingly, in the past, as soon as a girl was born, mothers and grandmothers would start embroidering Baghs and Phulkaris, which were to be given away at the time of marriage. Depending on the status of the family, the parents would give dowry of 11 to 101 Baghs and Phulkaris. Historically, the exquisite embroidery for Baghs are known to have been made in the districts of Hazara, Peshawar, Sialkot, Jhelum, Rawalpindi, Multan, Amritsar, Jalandhar, Ambala, Ludhiana, Nabha, Jind, Faridkot, Kapurthala and Chakwal of the Punjab region. Phulkari and Bagh embroidery has influenced the embroidery of Gujarat known as heer bharat in its use of geometrical motifs and stitchery. Phulkaris and Baghs were worn by women all over Punjab during marriage festivals and other joyous occasions. They were embroidered by the women for their own use and use of other family members and were not for sale in the market. Thus, it was purely a domestic art which not only satisfied their inner urge for creation but brought colour into day-to-day life. In a way, it was true folk art. Noting the value of traditional Phulkaris, Aryan (1983) collected the garments noting their spectacular artwork. Such efforts to preserve the art of Phulkari has influenced its revival."
"Wine humour is humour associated with wine. As well as ordinary anecdotes, cartoons and jokes, the whimsical labels and names given to wine are a particular source of amusement. Humour is usually rare in the world of wine, and wine jokes may only be amusing to wine obsessives."
"Alcoholic beverages appear in the Hebrew Bible, after Noah planted a vineyard and became inebriated. In the New Testament, Jesus miraculously made copious amounts of wine at the marriage at Cana (John 2). Wine is the most common alcoholic beverage mentioned in biblical literature, where it is a source of symbolism, and was an important part of daily life in biblical times. Additionally, the inhabitants of ancient Israel drank beer, and wines made from fruits other than grapes, and references to these appear in scripture. The word ""Alcohol"" is Arabic; from the root word (Al-Ghawl/Ghul) ""Ghawl"" or ""Ghul"" which translates to Ghoul, Hobgoblin, Bogey(man), Ogre (man eating giant), and Alcohol. The Qur’an—verse 37:47 uses the Arabic form ""Al-Ghawl"" referring to the intoxication associated with alcohol when in wine. The root word ""Ghawla"" translates as 'foolish' or 'ignorant'. Referencing a Ghoul, this is known as an evil spirit and further translates 'to seize'. The term Bogey(man) is sometimes used as a personification of the Devil. Along with the root word that refers to a spirit or demon, Europeans later adapted the word (likely in the 16th century) and eventually it also came to be used in science circles as a technical term for the Ethanol it also is. Given the root of the word and its description/nature as being that of a ""Demon who seizes and destroys"", many Christians abstain from Alcohol, noting that Jesus drove out demons. Along with citing its destructive power on individuals and society, as it is often listed as the most dangerous drug in the world, they cite, among other verses, 1 Corinthians 10:21, which states, ""You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too; you cannot have a part in both the Lord’s table and the table of demons."" Others think Biblical literature displays an ambivalence toward drinks that can be intoxicating, considering them both a blessing from God that brings joy and merriment and potentially dangerous beverages that can be sinfully abused. The relationships between Judaism and alcohol and Christianity and alcohol have generally maintained this same tension, though some modern Christian sects, particularly American Protestant groups around the time of Prohibition, have rejected alcohol as evil. The original versions of the books of the Bible use several different words for alcoholic beverages: at least 10 in Hebrew, and five in Greek. Drunkenness is discouraged and not infrequently portrayed, and some biblical persons abstained from alcohol. Wine is used symbolically, in both positive and negative terms. Its consumption is prescribed for religious rites or medicinal uses in some places."
"Christ in the winepress or the mystical winepress is a motif in Christian iconography showing Christ standing in a winepress, where Christ himself becomes the grapes in the press. It derives from the interpretation by Augustine and other early theologians of a group of passages in the Bible and is found as a visual image in Christian art between about 1100 and the 18th century, as well as in religious literature of many kinds. The image in art underwent a number of changes of emphasis, while remaining fairly consistent in its basic visual content, and was one of the relatively few medieval metaphorical or allegorical devotional images to maintain a foothold in Protestant iconography after the Reformation."

"Copia: The American Center for Wine, Food & the Arts was a non-profit museum and educational center in downtown Napa, California, dedicated to wine, food and the arts of American culture. The center, planned and largely funded by vintners Robert and Margrit Mondavi, was open from 2001 to 2008. The 78,632-square-foot (7,305.2 m2) museum had galleries, two theaters, classrooms, a demonstration kitchen, a restaurant, a rare book library, and a 3.5-acre (1.4 ha) vegetable and herb garden; there it hosted wine and food tasting programs, exhibitions, films, and concerts. The main and permanent exhibition of the museum, ""Forks in the Road"", explained the origins of cooking through to modern advances. The museum's establishment benefited the city of Napa and the development and gentrification of its downtown. Copia hosted its opening celebration on November 18, 2001. Among other notable people, Julia Child helped fund the venture, which established a restaurant named Julia's Kitchen. Copia struggled to achieve its anticipated admissions, and had difficulty in repaying its debts. Proceeds from ticket sales, membership and donations attempted to support Copia's payoff of debt, educational programs and exhibitions, but eventually were not sufficient. After numerous changes to the museum to increase revenue, Copia closed on November 21, 2008. Its library was donated to Napa Valley College and its Julia Child cookware was sent to the National Museum of American History. The 12-acre (4.9 ha) property had been for sale since its closure; the Culinary Institute of America purchased the northern portion of the property in October 2015. The college opened its campus, the Culinary Institute of America at Copia, which houses the CIA's new Food Business School."

"In brewing and winemaking, free amino nitrogen (FAN) is a measure of the concentration of individual amino acids and small peptides (one to three units) which can be utilized by beer and wine yeast for cell growth and proliferation. Together with ammonia, FAN makes up the measurement of yeast assimilable nitrogen that can be measured prior to the start of fermentation. The exact components of FAN will vary from composition of the wort or grape must. In wine, all 21 amino acids can be found in trace amounts with arginine, proline and glutamine being the most abundant. However, as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the primary yeast for both beer and wine, can not utilize proline in the anaerobic conditions of ethanol fermentation it is not included in FAN (and subsequently YAN) calculations."

"Sinking of champagne is the act of pouring out champagne in the sink. Sinking probably started in Sweden as ""a reaction to the ban on spraying champagne in many bars"" and the sinking is usually done by a person ordering two bottles of champagne and asking the bartender to pour out (sink) one of them. The term ""sinking"" is a translation of the Swedish term, ""vaskning,"" derived from ""vask,"" which means ""sink""."

"The Baumé scale is a pair of hydrometer scales developed by French pharmacist Antoine Baumé in 1768 to measure density of various liquids. The unit of the Baumé scale has been notated variously as degrees Baumé, B°, Bé° and simply Baumé (the accent is not always present). One scale measures the density of liquids heavier than water and the other, liquids lighter than water. The Baumé of distilled water is 0. The API gravity scale is based on errors in early implementations of the Baumé scale."
"Degrees Brix (symbol °Bx) is the sugar content of an aqueous solution.One degree Brix is 1 gram of sucrose in 100 grams of solution and represents the strength of the solution as percentage by mass. If the solution contains dissolved solids other than pure sucrose, then the °Bx only approximates the dissolved solid content. For example, when one adds equal amounts of salt and sugar to equal amounts of water, the degrees of refraction (BRIX) of the salt solution rises faster than the sugar solution. The °Bx is traditionally used in the wine, sugar, carbonated beverage, fruit juice, , maple syrup and honey industries. Comparable scales for indicating sucrose content are the degree Plato (°P), which is widely used by the brewing industry, and the degree Balling, which is the oldest of the three systems and therefore mostly found in older textbooks, but also still in use in some parts of the world. A sucrose solution with an apparent specific gravity (20°/20 °C) of 1.040 would be 9.99325 °Bx or 9.99359 °P while the representative sugar body, the International Commission for Uniform Methods of Sugar Analysis (ICUMSA), which favours the use of mass fraction, would report the solution strength as 9.99249%. Because the differences between the systems are of little practical significance (the differences are less than the precision of most common instruments) and wide historical use of the Brix unit, modern instruments calculate mass fraction using ICUMSA official formulas but report the result as °Bx."
"Capacities of wine casks were formerly measured and standardised according to a specific system of English units. The various units were historically defined in terms of the wine gallon so varied according to the definition of the gallon until the adoption of the Queen Anne wine gallon in 1707. In the United Kingdom and its colonies the units were redefined with the introduction of the imperial system whilst the Queen Anne wine gallon was adopted as the standard US liquid gallon. The major wine producing countries use barrels extensively and have developed standards at variance with the traditional English volumes that are commonly used in the wine and wine cooperage industries. Examples include a hogshead of 300 L (66 imp gal; 79 US gal), a barrique of 220 L (48 imp gal; 58 US gal) (Bordeaux), a barrel of 225 L (49 imp gal; 59 US gal) (Australia), a barrel of 230 L (51 imp gal; 61 US gal) (Burgundy) and a puncheon of 465 L (102 imp gal; 123 US gal)."
"The Oechsle scale is a hydrometer scale measuring the density of grape must, which is an indication of grape ripeness and sugar content used in wine-making. It is named for Ferdinand Oechsle (1774–1852) and it is widely used in the German, Swiss and Luxembourgish wine-making industries. On the Oechsle scale, one degree Oechsle (° Oe) corresponds to one gram of the difference between the mass of one litre of must at 20 °C and 1 kg (the mass of 1 litre of water). For example, must with a specific mass of 1084 grams per litre has 84° Oe."
"Mysore painting (Kannada: ಮೈಸೂರು ಚಿತ್ರಕಲೆ) is an important form of classical South Indian painting that originated in and around the town of Mysore in Karnataka encouraged and nurtured by the Mysore rulers. Painting in Karnataka has a long and illustrious history, tracing its origins back to the Ajanta times (2nd century B.C. to 7th century A.D.) The distinct school of Mysore painting evolved from the paintings of Vijayanagar times during the reign of the Vijayanagar Kings (1336-1565 AD) The rulers of Vijayanagar andtheir feudatories encouraged literature, art, architecture, religious and philosophical discussions. With the fall of the Vijayanagar empire after the Battle of Talikota the artists who were till then under royal patronage migrated to various other places like Mysore, Tanjore, Surpur, etc. Absorbing the local artistic traditions and customs, the erstwhile Vijayanagar School of Painting gradually evolved into the many styles of painting in South India, including the Mysore and Tanjore schools of painting. Mysore paintings are known for their elegance, muted colours, and attention to detail. The themes for most of these paintings are Hindu gods and goddesses and scenes from Hindu mythology."
"Thanjavur painting is a classical South Indian painting style, which was inaugurated from the town of Thanjavur (anglicized as Tanjore). The art form draws its immediate resources and inspiration from way back about 1600 AD, a period when the Nayakas of Thanjavur under the suzerainty of the Vijayanagara Rayas encouraged art—chiefly, classical dance and music—as well as literature, both in Telugu and Tamil and painting of chiefly Hindu religious subjects in temples. It is distinguished by its famous gold coating. However, it can safely be surmised that Thanjavur painting, as we know it now, originated in the Maratha court of Thanjavur (1676–1855). It has been recognized as a Geographical indication by the Government of India in 2007-08. Thanjavur paintings are characterised by rich and vivid colors, simple iconic composition, glittering gold foils overlaid on delicate but extensive gesso work and inlay of glass beads and pieces or very rarely precious and semi-precious gems. In Thanjavur paintings one can see the influence of Deccani, Vijayanagar, Maratha and even European or Company styles of painting. Essentially serving as devotional icons, the subjects of most paintings are Hindu gods, goddesses, and saints. Episodes from Hindu Puranas, Sthala-puranas and other religious texts were visualised, sketched or traced and painted with the main figure or figures placed in the central section of the picture (mostly within an architecturally delineated space such as a mantapa or prabhavali) surrounded by several subsidiary figures, themes and subjects. There are also many instances when Jain, Sikh, Muslim, other religious and even secular subjects were depicted in Tanjore paintings. Thanjavur paintings are panel paintings done on wooden planks, and hence referred to as palagai padam (palagai = ""wooden plank""; padam = ""picture"") in local parlance. In modern times, these paintings have become souvenirs for festive occasions in South India – colourful pieces of art to decorate walls, and collectors' items for art lovers, as also sadly sometimes, dime-a-dozen bric-a-bracs to be purchased from street corner practitioners."
"Kalighat painting or Kalighat Pat (Bengali: কালীঘাট পটচিত্র) originated in the 19th century in West Bengal, India, in the vicinity of Kalighat Kali Temple, Kalighat, Calcutta, and from being items of souvenir taken by the visitors to the Kali temple, the paintings over a period of time developed as a distinct school of Indian painting. From the depiction of Hindu gods, god, and other mythological characters, the Kalighat paintings developed to reflect a variety of subjects, including many depictions of everyday life."
"Warli painting is a form of tribal art mostly created by the tribal people from the North Sahyadri Range in Maharashtra, India. This range encompasses cities such as Dahanu, Talasari, Jawhar, Palghar, Mokhada, and Vikramgad of Palghar district. This tribal art was originated in Maharashtra, where it is still practiced today."
"Cheriyal Scroll Painting is a stylized version of Nakashi art, rich in the local motifs peculiar to the Telangana. They are at present made only in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The scrolls are painted in a narrative format, much like a film roll or a comic strip, depicting stories from Indian mythology, and intimately tied to the shorter stories from the Puranas and Epics. Earlier, these paintings were prevalent across Andhra, as also various other parts of the country, albeit flavoured with their distinct styles and other local peculiarities dictated by the local customs and traditions. In the same way, Cheriyal scrolls must have been popular across Telangana in earlier times, though with the advent of television, cinemas and computers it has been fenced into its last outpost, the Cheriyal town."
"Methoxypyrazines are a class of chemical compounds that produce odors. The odors tend to be undesirable, as in the case of certain wines, or as defensive chemicals used by insects such as Harmonia axyridis which produces isopropyl methoxy pyrazine (IPMP). They have also been identified as additives in cigarette manufacture. Detection thresholds are very low, typically near 2 parts per trillion (1 ng/L)."

"Annual wine festivals celebrate viticulture and usually occur after the harvest of the grapes which, in the northern hemisphere, generally falls at the end of September and runs until well into October or later. They are common in most wine regions around the world and are to be considered in the tradition of other harvest festivals. The Egyptian god Osiris was dedicated to wine, but the oldest historically documented wine festivals can be traced back to the Greek celebrations for their wine god Dionysos. The typical ingredients of a wine festival include wine drinking, grape pressing, regional foods, music and, in many areas, religious ritual."
"Toques et Clochers is an annual two-day charitable gastronomy festival in Aude, France dedicated to the celebration of Chardonnay production in the Limoux wine appellation, sponsored by the Sieur d'Arques wine cooperative. The festival has taken place each year since 1991 during the weekend of Palm Sunday in the area of Limoux and Saint-Hilaire. Each year a different village in the appellation is chosen to host the festival and the money raised is used to restore the church in that village. On the first day of the festival, the host village holds a celebration for the public, including wine-tasting, art exhibitions and music. On the second day, the Sieur d'Arques cooperative hosts an auction of local wines and a gala dinner. The wine auction is presided over by Michelin starred chefs who also create the gala dinner, while an award-winning sommelier selects the wines. In 2008, the auction of wines raised 537,750 euros. The event's name refers to the tall hats worn by chefs (toques) and bell towers or steeples (clochers), since the money raised from the auctions is given to churches to restore their belltowers. In 2018, the first day of the festival, due to be held in the village of Loupia, was cancelled as a mark of respect to those killed a day earlier in an Islamist terror attack in nearby Trebes and Carcassonne."

"The Pittsburgh Wine Festival is an annual festival celebrating wine in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The festival is sponsored by the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, which maintains an on-site wine shop. The Pittsburgh festival follows a similar one in Philadelphia. The first event was held in 2003, amid some questioning whether a ""beer city"" like Pittsburgh could sustain a wine festival. It is now well established, however, and the festival receives generally positive reviews from wine critics. In fact, tickets usually sell out. It was named to the Top 10 list of wine events in the United States by the Quarterly Review of Wines. Its success inspired the Pittsburgh Whiskey & Fine Spirits Festival. Proceeds from the festival benefit charity. By the fourth year, in 2007, the festival had raised over $400,000 for charity. By 2009, that figure had grown to $6 million, with large portions going to Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh Cancer Institute."
"The Great Led Zeppelin Wine Pairing is a series of “wine and music pairings,” created by noted restaurateur and viticulturist Joe Bastianich and writer-musician Mike Edison, along with writer and wine expert David Lynch. Bastianich and Lynch are both recipients of the The idea was formed when Bastianich and Edison were pondering how to pair the songs of Led Zeppelin with various wines. ""Our passion for wine is only rivaled by our passion for Zeppelin,” said Bastianich, and encouraged attendees to ""taste with their ears and listen with their mouths."" Edison, in an interview with publishing blog Galley Cat, said, ""Either you see this as a hyper-intellectual exercise in promoting the lexicon of oenology as a valid critical system while simultaneously subverting it and subjecting it to ridicule—or you think it is just some dudes who want to drink some really good wine and listen to Led Zeppelin. No matter what, it is still going be the best salon since Dorothy Parker made that crack about horticulture.”"
The Pinot noir passing-off controversy arose in 2010 within the wine industry over the passing-off by French distributors of Merlot and Syrah wine as Pinot noir in the United States. The controversy involved the mislabeling of wines from vintners in southern France which were falsely sold to American distributors E & J Gallo Winery as Pinot noir. The mislabeling resulted in a French court convicting twelve people for fraud.
"In the Grand European Jury Wine Tasting of 1997, the Grand Jury Européen, consisting entirely of European judges, conducted a blind tasting of 27 Chardonnay wines from seven countries. Held in Bordeaux, 70 percent of the entries in the wine competition were from France (Burgundy). All other countries were represented with one entry each, except for Australia, which had two. The French wine entries were ""a regular Hall of White Burgundy Fame. They had such great vineyards and outstanding producers as Meursault Charmes from and Meursault Perrières from Domaine Coche-Dury."" In addition, ""Various hyphenated grand cru Montrachets showed up: two Chevalier-Montrachets, one from Bouchard Père et Fils, the other from Maison Louis Jadot. Other grands crus included a Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet from and two Corton-Charlemagnes (Louis Latour and Domaine Bonneau du Martray). Two Montrachets were present as well, from Marquis de Laguiche (Joseph Drouhin) and Domaine Jacques Prieur"" (Kramer, p. 110). In addition, there was Puligny-Montrachet Les Combettes from , Puligny-Montrachet Les Pucelles Domaine Leflaive, and Chablis Grand Cru Valmur from that district's most acclaimed producer, Domaine Francois Raveneau. The judges tasted three vintages of each wine, a 1989, a 1992 and a 1994. At the end of the evaluation, the judges declared the top wine to be Robert Mondavi Chardonnay Reserve, a California wine. Rank number two was won by Domaine Comtes Lafon's Meursault Charmes.The organizer told Matt Kramer, who wrote an article about the event in Wine Spectator, that he had later ""put on the exact same tasting, with the exact same wines, in New York using American tasters. The results were almost identical"" (Kramer, p. 111)."
"The New York Wine Tasting of 1973 was organized by pioneering wine journalist Robert Lawrence Balzer. He assembled 14 leading wine experts including France's Alexis Lichine, who owned two chateaux in Bordeaux, a manager of the Four Seasons restaurant in New York City, and Sam Aaron, a prominent New York wine merchant. They evaluated 23 Chardonnays from California, New York, and France in a blind tasting before an assemblage of 250 members of the New York Food and Wine Society. California Chardonnays received the top four scores. Fifth place went to the 1969 Beaune Clos des Mouches Joseph Drouhin. Other French wines in the competition were the 1970 Corton-Charlemagne Louis Latour, the 1971 Pouilly-Fuisse Louis Jadot, and the 1970 Joseph Drouhin. Three years later, in the notable Paris Wine Tasting of 1976, American and French wines were once again compared in a blind tasting."
"A Wine Olympics was organized by the French food and wine magazine Gault-Millau in 1979. A total of 330 wines from 33 countries were evaluated by 62 experts from ten nationalities. The 1976 contestant Trefethen Vineyards Chardonnay from Napa Valley won the Chardonnay tasting and was judged best in the world. Gran Coronas Mas La Plana 1970 from Spain received first place in the Cabernet Sauvignon blend category. In the Pinot noir competition, the 1975 Eyrie Vineyards Reserve from Oregon placed in the top ten. The 1975 HMR Pinot Noir from Paso Robles placed third. Tyrell Pinot Noir 1976 from Australia was selected for the Gault-Millau World Dozen and placed first."
"A number of German wine auctions are held each year, where the premier German wine producers auction off some of the best young wines, as well as some older wines. Most auctions are arranged by the regional associations of Verband Deutscher Prädikats- und Qualitätsweingüter (VDP). These auctions differ from wine auctions on the second-hand market held by auction houses, where collectible wines are sold by private or corporate owners, since it is ""first hand"" wines that are sold."
"The Garagiste Festivals are Californian non-profit wine festivals showcasing wines made by small-scale artisan ""garagiste"" producers."
"The Great Chardonnay Showdown, held in the spring of 1980, was organized by Craig Goldwyn, the wine columnist for the Chicago Tribune and the founder of the Beverage Testing Institute, with help from three Chicago wine stores. A total of 221 Chardonnays from around the world were selected for the blind wine competition. France and California were heavily represented, but entries from many countries around the world were included."
"A wine auction is an auction devoted to wine, sometimes in combination with other alcoholic beverages. There are two basic types of wine auctions: first hand wine auctions, where wineries sell their own wines, and second hand wine auctions, arranged by auction houses or other auctioneers to make it possible for any owners of wine to trade it. In most cases, the wines traded at wine auctions are collectible wine, so-called ""fine wine"". These are wines which are typically suitable for extended cellaring, and where some of the buyers are looking for mature wines which are no longer available through first-hand retail channels."
"The Los Angeles International Competitions event focuses on the wine, spirits, beer and olive oil industries. Distributors and makers in each industry submit entries to be judged by a panel of experts."
"La Paulée de Meursault is a lunch celebrating the end of the grape harvest in Burgundy, France. Originally, the celebration included only winemakers, cellar workers, and the surrounding community. It has since evolved to become an international wine event, and an integral part of Les Trois Glorieuses, which also includes a charity auction held at the Hospices de Beaune and a formal dinner at the Clos de Vougeot. Approximately 700 people attend the lunch, held in the Château de Meursault. The event was formally organized in the mid-1920s by the Count Lafon. Traditionally, the winemakers would compete to bring the best bottle of wine to impress their favorite clients. In the modern era, , grandson of Count Lafon, participates in and helps organize the event."
"Vinitaly is an international wine competition and exposition that is held annually in April in the Italian wine region of Verona in northeast Italy. The event is exclusively for wine professionals featuring an average of 3000 wines from several dozen countries. First held in 1967, VinItaly has been called the ""most important convention of domestic and international wines"" and the ""largest wine show in the world"". For producers in the Italian wine industry, attendance and the reception that their wines receive is considered a barometer for measuring the health and success of the market, particularly for emerging Italian wine regions. The event is also used as an opportunity by wineries to release new wines and wine styles or announce partnerships with universities, organic and biodynamic wine organizations or even other wineries. Along with Vinexpo, which is held every other year in the French wine region of Bordeaux, VinItaly is considered one of the premier international wine events."
"The Varsity Blind Wine Tasting Match is an annual competition in blind wine tasting between the blind tasting teams of the Oxford University Blind Wine Tasting Society and the Cambridge University Blind Wine Tasting Society which has run since 1953.

The taster with the highest individual score wins a bottle of Pol Roger's top cuvee, Sir Winston Churchill. The reserve taster with the higher score wins a subscription to Decanter Magazine. The losing team each wins a bottle of Non Vintage Pol Roger."
"A wine competition is an organized event in which trained judges or consumers competitively rate different vintages, categories, and/or brands of wine. Wine competitions generally use blind tasting of wine to prevent bias by the judges."
"The Judgment of Princeton was a wine tasting (or blind tasting) event held on 8 June 2012 during a conference of the American Association of Wine Economists held at Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey. The purpose of this event was to compare, by a blind tasting, of several French wines against wines produced in New Jersey in order to gauge the quality and development of the New Jersey wine industry. Because New Jersey's wine industry is relatively young and small, it has received little attention in the world wine market. The state's wine production has experienced growth in recent years largely as a result of state legislators offering new opportunities for winery licensing and repealing Prohibition-era laws that have constrained the industry's development in past years. This event was modeled after a 1976 blind tasting event dubbed the ""Judgment of Paris"" in which French wines were compared to several wines produced in California when that state's wine industry was similarly young and developing. The New Jersey wine industry heralded the results and asserted that the rating of New Jersey wines by the blind tasting's judges was a victory for the state's wine industry."

It normally takes place in late September in eastern Georgia and in mid-October in western Georgia. In Georgia, where wine has an iconic significance, the tradition of rtveli dates back to ancient times, having its roots in the festivity of mid-Autumn abundance and variety. Rtveli usually lasts for several days, with people starting working in early morning hours and ending the day with a feast in the accompaniment of vintage-themed folk songs."
"The Zielona Góra Wine Fest (Polish: Winobranie w Zielonej Górze) is a wine festival held in the Polish town of Zielona Góra. The tradition is related to the period of harvest of grapes from the local vineyards which were then turned into wine. The first festival took place in October 1852. Nowadays it starts in the first or second week of September and lasts for nine days. The festivities starts on a Saturday with a parade through the city centre. It is preceded by a symbolic ceremony when the Roman wine god Bacchus and his Maenads receive the keys to the town from the local authorities. During the nine days a lot of cultural and sport events take place, among which the International Festival of Folklore is one of the most prominent. There are also theatre meetings (including street theatres) and music concerts. The centre of the town turns into a big marketplace for the time of the fest, with a separate street allotted for the antiques market."

"Munskänkarna is a Swedish and Finnish wine tasting organization with over 20,000 members. The Swedish word ""Munskänk"" (corresponding to Mundschenk in German) is synonymous with ""cup-bearer"". It is used to refer to a single member, with the organisation's name ""Munskänkarna"" being the plural definite form. The organisation was established in Stockholm in 1958 and has continuously expanded with chapters in other locations, some outside of Sweden. In 2000, the chapters in Finland had become numerous enough to split off to form their own Finnish language organisation, Suomen Munskänkarna. In 2002, a Swedish language organisation in Finland called Svenska Munskänkarna i Finland was also formed. All three organisations are established as non-profit organisations. As of 2006, the Swedish branch of Munskänkarna had over 19,000 members in 137 chapters, of which 129 in Sweden and 8 in other countries. In Finland there were 13 chapters in the Finnish-speaking organisation and 9 chapters in the Swedish-speaking organisation. Munskänkarna claims to be the world's largest wine tasting organisation. Activities of Munskänkarna primarily include wine tastings and wine-related courses. The courses are organised much in the same way as those of the Wine & Spirit Education Trust: there are several different levels of progressing difficulty, and both a theoretical and a practical (i.e., blind tasting of wine) test at each level, plus a thesis at the highest level. Munskänkarna in Sweden publishes a magazine (Munskänken) where, among other things, most new wines appearing in the Swedish monopoly wine stores (Systembolaget) are reviewed."
"The Grand Jury Européen (GJE) is an Association sans but lucratif (association without lucrative purpose under Luxembourg law) with the aim of providing an alternative classification of wine, founded in 1996 by François Mauss. The Grand Jury Européen assembles a minimum of 12 permanent members, from at least 6 different countries of the European Union and Switzerland, for blind tasting a maximum of 68 wines in two daily 3-hour sessions. Such events have included the Grand European Jury Wine Tasting of 1997 and the ""Judgment of Sauternes"" of October, 2006. The concept of GJE came to Mauss at ""6 o'clock on the morning of 29 June 1996"", as he sought to develop a method that in several ways was opposite to the approach of Robert Parker, in order to provide an alternative to Parker's scores. Initially Mauss wrote to some 200 Bordeaux châteaux, announcing plans of tasting the 1983, 1985 and 1990 vintages and requested purchase information, but received only three responses, from châteaux Haut-Brion, Pichon Lalande and Sociando-Mallet. In 2006 Mauss expressed criticism of the Judgment of Paris 30th Anniversary, adding to his reputation as ""a dissenting voice in the wine world"", also established by the Beaujolais nouveau ""vin de merde case""."

The foundation relies on private donors, mainly from winemakers; in 2003 they managed to get 808 competing grapegrowers and vintners to contribute $1,178,652.97 to fund cooperative research; however, in the past they have often failed to make $1 million annually. In recent years they have invested in research into wine production in the states of Washington, Oregon, Texas and Virginia."
"The Minnesota Grape Growers Association (MGGA) was established in 1976 to further the art and science of growing grapes in cold climates. The association sponsors workshops, tours, tastings of locally produced wines and sponsors an important annual conference on cold climate viticulture. In August 2013, in partnership with the University of Minnesota, the MGGA held the 5th . This event featured over 300 different wines and was judged by a panel of 21 judges including Food and Wine writers, oenologists, wine marketers and other expert tasters. This year's winners can be found on the competition website, International Cold Climate Wine Competition. In February 2014, the MGGA hosted the 10th Annual Cold Climate Grape & Wine Conference.

"Le Comité Interprofessionnel du vin de Champagne (CIVC) is an organisation grouping the actors of the Champagne production and trade - growers, cooperatives and merchants - under the direction of the government. It is charged with organizing and controlling the production, distribution, and promotion of the wines of Champagne as well as conducting research. Until 1990 it set the price of grapes and still intervenes to regulate the size of the harvest and to limit the production of wine in order to maintain market prices. One of the prominent activities of CIVC is to safeguard the name Champagne, which is a protected designation of origin as well as a very valuable trademark. CIVC is quick to resort to litigation at any non-authorized use of the Champagne name. CIVC also operates activities in other countries to educate consumers and to have national representation for the protection of the Champagne name. An example is the Champagne Bureau (formerly the Office of Champagne) in the United States."

The building designed by Cox Grieve Gillett uses building materials to reflect items used in making wine. The exterior of the building looks like a section of a wine barrel. Outside the building are rows of grapevines, showing seven different varieties of grapes to curious visitors who normally would not have access to a vineyard to see the differences for themselves."
"Associação Portuguesa da Cortiça is the Portuguese Cork Association, a consortium of cork growers and manufacturers. It was founded in 1956 and is based in the town of Santa Maria de Lamas in northern Portugal. The current president of APCOR is . A current issue for the association is the decreasing support for cork as a bottle seal, as the popularity of plastic and other stoppers rises. There is a major discussion about which closure suits wine the best. There are several reports defending the use of screwcaps, mostly coming from New Zealand, but for each report defending the use of screwcaps, there is also another report defending the use of corks."

"Comité Régional d'Action Viticole (CRAV, Regional Committee for Viticultural Action), or sometimes Comité d'action viticole (CAV, Committee for Viticultural Action) is a group of militant French wine producers. It has claimed responsibility for numerous attacks including dynamiting grocery stores, a winery, the agriculture ministry offices in two cities, burning a car at another, hijacking a tanker, and destroying large quantities of non-French wine. CRAV is mainly active in Languedoc-Roussillon in the south of France, which is the French wine region which the group believes has been plagued by surplus production and a subsequent need to adapt the quality and quantity of wine produced to changing market realities, including reduced domestic demand for simple wine for everyday consumption. This process, which has involved considerable European Union subsidies, has had negative effects on smaller producers and has met with various protests, of which CRAV is the most violent. CRAV's publicised demands have regularly included elements which are more-or-less impossible for French politicians to implement under European Union rules, since they would mean interfering with the single market and introducing national subsidies on top of the Common Agricultural Policy. The group has called for higher restrictive tariffs against the rising imports of Spanish and Italian wine, where lower social costs, less red tape and a different industry structure leads to more economical wine production. Consumer preference for wine brands, uncomplicated wine labels, varietal labelling, and New World wine styles has also led to expanding exports from Australia, Chile, the United States, and other New World producers. Frustration spreads far beyond radical producers. ""Each bottle of American and Australian wine that lands in Europe is a bomb targeted at the heart of our rich European culture,"" argues grower Aime Guibert. The French manager for the E. & J. Gallo Winery, Sylvain Removille, reports that he and his sales staff have repeatedly been physically assaulted. On 17 May 2007, the group released a video in which it was stated that blood would flow if Nicolas Sarkozy failed to act to raise the price of wine."

"Cork is an impermeable buoyant material, the phellem layer of bark tissue that is harvested for commercial use primarily from Quercus suber (the cork oak), which is native to southwest Europe and northwest Africa. Cork is composed of suberin, a hydrophobic substance. Because of its impermeable, buoyant, elastic, and fire retardant properties, it is used in a variety of products, the most common of which is wine stoppers. The montado landscape of Portugal produces approximately half of cork harvested annually worldwide, with Corticeira Amorim being the leading company in the industry. Cork was examined microscopically by Robert Hooke, which led to his discovery and naming of the cell. Cork composition varies depending on geographic origin, climate and soil conditions, genetic origin, tree dimensions, age (virgin or reproduction), and growth conditions. However, in general, cork is made up of suberin (average of about 40%), lignin (22%), polysaccharides (cellulose and hemicellulose) (18%), extractables (15%) and others."
"A cellarette or cellaret is a small furniture cabinet, available in various sizes, shapes, and designs which is used to store bottles of alcoholic beverages such as wine or whiskey. They usually come with some type of security such as a lock to protect the contents. Such wooden containers for alcoholic beverages appeared in Europe as early as the fifteenth century. They first appeared in America in the early eighteenth century and were popular through the nineteenth century. They were usually made of a decorative wood and sometimes had special designs so as to conceal them from the casual observer. They were found in pubs, taverns, and homes of the wealthy."
"A fiasco (/fiˈæskoʊ/; Italian: [ˈfjasko], plural: fiaschi) is a typical Italian style of bottle, usually with a round body and bottom, partially or completely covered with a close-fitting straw basket. The basket is typically made of sala, a swamp weed, sun-dried and blanched with sulfur. The basket provides protection during transportation and handling, and also a flat base for the container. Thus the glass bottle can have a round bottom, which is much simpler to make by glass blowing. Fiaschi can be efficiently packed for transport, with the necks of inverted bottles safely tucked into the spaces between the baskets of upright ones."
"A Pythagorean cup (also known as a Pythagoras cup, Greedy Cup, Cup of Justice, Tantalus cup or i koupa tis dikaiosynis) is a practical joke device in a form of a drinking cup, credited to Pythagoras of Samos. When it is filled beyond a certain point, a siphoning effect causes the cup to drain its entire contents through the base. The cup can be used to learn about greed."
"A porró is a traditional glass wine pitcher, which holds 0.75 litres (25 US fl oz) typical of Spain, originating in Catalonia and eventually spreading to other parts of Spain. This invention allows everyone to drink from the same utensil without touching it with their lips. It fosters communal drinking accompanying food, though it does require some skill to ensure the wine enters one's mouth and to keep it from spilling onto clothing. Some might say it resembles a cross between a wine bottle and a watering can. The top of the bottle is narrow and can be sealed off with a cork. Stemming upwards from the bottom of the pitcher is a spout that gradually tapers off to a small opening. It is shaped such that the wine stored inside it will have minimal contact with the air, while being ready to be used at all times. Until the mid-twentieth century it was very common in homes, but the tradition is now slowly being lost. The idea originated as a replacement to bota bags. Porrons are most commonly filled with regular wines, either white or red, but are also used to drink cava, and a smaller version filled with a sweet, dessert wine (typically Grenache) is also common in Catalan restaurants. The lack of contact with the lips allows a group of people to share the same vessel without offending their sense of hygiene."
"Wine accessories are things that may be used in the storage or serving of wine. Wine accessories include many items such as wine glasses, corkscrews, and wine racks."
"A wine glass is a type of glass that is used to drink and taste wine. Most wine glasses are stemware, that is they are goblets composed of three parts: the bowl, stem, and foot."
"A Champagne glass is stemware designed for champagne and other sparkling wines. The two most common forms are the flute and coupe, both stemmed; holding the glass by the stem prevents warming the drink. Champagne can also be drunk from a normal wine glass, which allows better appreciation of the flavor, at the expense of accentuating the bubbles less."
"A krater or crater (Greek: κρατήρ, kratēr, literally ""mixing vessel"") was a large vase in Ancient Greece, used for the dilution of wine with water."
The Jerningham wine cooler is a large wine cooler made out of silver in the 18th century.
"A Wine-table is a late 15th-century device for facilitating after-dinner drinking, the cabinetmakers called it a ""Gentleman's Social Table."" It was always narrow and of semicircular or horseshoe form, and the guests sat round the outer circumference. In the earlier and simpler shapes metal wells for bottles and ice were sunk in the surface of the table; they were fitted with brass lids. In later and more elaborate examples the tables were fitted with a revolving wine-carriage, bottle-holder or tray working upon a balanced arm which enabled the bottles to be passed to any guest without shaking. The side opposite the guests was often fitted with a network bag. It has been conjectured that this bag was intended to hold biscuits, but it is much more likely that its function was to prevent glasses and bottles which might be upset from falling to the floor. That the wine-table might be drawn up to the fire in cold weather without inconvenience from the heat it was fitted with curtains hung upon a brass frame and running upon rings. Sometimes the table was accompanied by a circular bottle-stand supported on a tripod into which the bottles were deeply sunk to preserve them from the heat of the fire. Yet another form was circular with a socket in the center for the bottle. Wine-tables followed the fashion of other tables and were often inlaid with wood or brass. They are now exceedingly scarce."
"A fumarium was a smoke chamber used in Ancient Rome to enhance the flavor of wine through artificially ""aging"" the wine. Amphorae were placed in the chamber, which was built on top of a heated hearth, in order to impart a smoky flavor in the wine that also seemed to sharpen the acidity. The wine would sometimes come out of the fumarium with a paler color. In his book Vintage: The Story of Wine, Hugh Johnson noted that Pliny the Elder and Columella did not recommend that ""first-growth wines"" like Falernian, Caecuban, and Alban be smoked."
"An oenochoe, also spelled oinochoe (Ancient Greek: οἰνοχόη; from Ancient Greek: οἶνος oînos, ""wine"" and Ancient Greek: χέω khéō, ""I pour,"" sense ""wine-pourer""; plural oinochoai; New Latin oenochoë, plural oenochoae, English plural oenochoes or oinochoes), is a wine jug and a key form of ancient Greek pottery. Intermediate between a pithos (large storage vessel) or amphora (transport vessel), and individual cups or bowls, it held fluid for several persons temporarily until it could be poured. The term oinos (Linear B wo-no) appears in Mycenaean Greek, but not the compound. The characteristic form was popular throughout the Bronze Age, especially at prehistoric Troy. In classical times for the most part the term oinochoe implied the distribution of wine. As the word began to diversify in meaning, the shape became a more important identifier than the word. The oinochoe could pour any fluid, not just wine. The English word, pitcher, is perhaps the closest in function."
"The wine cup of Shah Jahan is a wine cup of white nephrite jade that was made for the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. The cup has a gourd shape like in a paisley design. The handle is shaped like the head of a ram. The bottom features acanthus leaves and a lotus flower, which is the pedestal. The cup is inscribed with his title, ""Second Lord of the Conjunction"", following the conventions of royal titulature in the Persian-speaking world. It specifically alludes to Timur, the central Asian ruler from whom the Mughals were descended. The artist who created the cup is unknown. The cup is dated 1067 of the Islamic calendar, and regnal year 31, which convert to 1657 CE. The place of production was India. The length is 18.7 cm and width 14 cm. It was acquired in the 19th century by Colonel Charles Seton Guthrie, most probably after the Indian rebellion of 1857. It was formerly in the possession of R. M. W. Walker, on whose death it was sold by Christie & Co (12/7/1945, lot 146) and passed from the purchasers, Messrs Spink, to Queen Maria of Yugoslavia. It again came into the hands of Spink, who then sold it to Mr Lazarus, who discovered the inscription and sold it back to the vendors. It was acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1962."
"A skyphos (Ancient Greek: σκύφος; plural skyphoi) is a two-handled deep wine-cup on a low flanged base or none. The handles may be horizontal ear-shaped thumbholds that project from the rim (in both Corinthian and Athenian shapes), or they may be loop handles at the rim or that stand away from the lower part of the body. Skyphoi of the type called glaux (owl) have one horizontal and one vertical thumbhold handle."

"Wine lactone is a pleasant smelling compound found naturally in apples, orange juice, grapefruit juice, orange essential oil, clementine peel oil and various grape wines. It was first discovered as an essential oil metabolite in koala urine by Southwell in 1975. It was discovered several years later by Guth in white wines and was named ""wine lactone"". This monoterpene imparts ""coconut, woody and sweet"" odors to a wine. There are 8 possible isomers of wine lactone with the (3S, 3a S, 7aR) isomer being the only one that has been found in wine. This isomer is also the most potent of all eight with an odor detection threshold of 10 ng/L in model wine. The odor threshold of the (3S,3aS,7aR)-wine lactone stereoisomer is 0.00001-0.00004 ng/l in air."
"Metsovo (Greek: Μέτσοβο, Aromanian: Aminciu) is a town in Epirus, in the mountains of Pindus in northern Greece, between Ioannina to the west and Meteora to the east.

Population 5,042 (2011). It is also the archaeological site of an ancient Minoan settlement in central Crete. The discovery of ancient roads leading from Archanes to Juktas, Anemospilia, and Vathypetro indicate that Archanes was an important hub in the region during Minoan times. Archaeological evidence indicates that ancient Archanes spread out over the same area as the modern town of Archanes."
"Colomé is a village and rural municipality in Salta Province in northwestern Argentina. It is located about 20 km from Molinos, Salta. This settlement was establish by the last Spanish governor of Salta, Nicolás Severo de Isasmendi, in 1831. His daughter Ascención imported grapevines from France and planted them in the area at an average altitude of 2200 m, which is extremely high for viticulture. The climat is dry and arid. Temperature differences between day and night can be high. Winters are very cold. Under these conditions, growing grapes is a challenge, but has the advantage, that insects, pests and diseases hardly are present. Swiss vigneron Donald M. Hess bought the Bodega Colomé and vineyards in the neighbourhood in 2001. One of his vineyards is at 3100 m (approx. 10,000 ft), the highest elevation worldwide. Its wine is called Altura Máxima. In addition, Donald M. Hess has built a museum in Colomé dedicated to the American artist James Turrell, which opened in 2009."
"Unterelsaß (also spelled Unterelsass, French: Basse-Alsace, meaning Lower Alsace) was the northern part of the historical region Alsace or Elsass, inhabited originally by locals speaking Alemannic German.

"Upper Alsace (southern Alsace) was a landgraviate of the Holy Roman Empire centred on Ensisheim and Landser, north of the County of Ferrette (Pfirt). The counts of Habsburg ruled the territory from the 1130s down to its cession to France in the 17th century. Albert III, Count of Habsburg, received the landgraviate of Upper Alsace from the Emperor Frederick I in 1186. Frederick's son, Duke Frederick V, was his lord with the title of Duke of Alsace (Elisatiae dux). On 9 May 1469, Duke Charles the Bold of Burgundy acquired the landgraviate of Upper Alsace and the county of Ferrette for 50,000 Rhenish florins. At the time of its purchase, the landgraviate was heavily mortgaged and pawned. Landser was mortgaged to Thüring von Hallwill for 7,000 florins. On 20 September Charles appointed Peter von Hagenbach as the ""grand bailiff (Landvogt) of Ferrette and Alsace"" with his seat at Ensisheim. This official was a successor of the previous Austrian-appointed Landvogt, and thus in the service of the landgrave of Upper Alsace. The Landvogtei (bailiwick) of Alsace itself was an imperial office then mortgaged to the Electoral Palatinate. On 14 April 1646, the imperial ambassador Trauttmansdorff, during negotiations to end the Thirty Years' War, offered ""Upper and Lower Alsace and the Sundgau, under the title of Landgraviate of Alsace"" to the French. There was no such territory, since Alsace was at the time divided into several jurisdictions held by competing powers. The Archduke Ferdinand Charles held the landgraviate of Upper Alsace, while a relative held the Landvogtei (bailiwick) of Hagenau with a protectorate over the Décapole (a league of ten imperial cities)."

"Aureobasidium pullulans is a ubiquitous and generalistic black, yeast-like fungus that can be found in different environments (e.g. soil, water, air and limestone). It is well known as a naturally occurring epiphyte or endophyte of a wide range of plant species (e.g. apple, grape, cucumber, green beans, cabbage) without causing any symptoms of disease. A. pullulans has a high importance in biotechnology for the production of different enzymes, siderophores and pullulan. Furthermore, A. pullulans is used in biological control of plant diseases, especially storage diseases. Chronic human exposure to A. pullulans via humidifiers or air conditioners can lead to hypersensitivity pneumonitis (extrinsic allergic alveolitis) or ""humidifier lung"". This condition is characterized acutely by dyspnea, cough, fever, chest infiltrates, and acute inflammatory reaction. The condition can also be chronic, and lymphocyte-mediated. The chronic condition is characterized radiographically by reticulonodular infiltrates in the lung, with apical sparing. The strains causing infections in humans were reclassified to A. melanogenum. A. pullulans can be cultivated on potato dextrose agar, where it produces smooth, faint pink, yeast-like colonies covered with a slimy mass of spores. Older colonies change to black due to chlamydospore production. Primary conidia are hyaline, smooth, ellipsoidal, one-celled, and variable in shape and size; secondary conidia are smaller. Conidiophores are undifferentiated, intercalary or terminal, or arising as short lateral branches. Endoconidia are produced in an intercalary cell and released into a neighboring empty cell. Hyphae are hyaline, smooth, and thinwalled, with transverse septa. The fungus grows at 10–35 °C with optimum growth at 30 °C. A. pullulans is notable for its phenotypic plasticity. Colony morphology may be affected by carbon source, colony age, temperature, light and substrate, with colonies ranging from homogeneous to sectored, yeast-like to filamentous growth, and from small to large. These changes, potentially influenced by epigenetic factors, and the particular developmental sequences that the colonies proceed through may be observed with the naked eye. Besides these morphological plasticity A. pullulans is also adaptable to various stressful conditions: hypersaline, acidic and alkaline, cold, and oligotrophic. Therefore, it is considered to be . The morphology-based taxonomy of the species is complicated by the large morphological variability between strains and even within a single strain. Based on molecular analyses, four varieties of the species A. pullulans were recognised: var. pullulans from substrates with low water activity and the phyllosphere and a variety of other habitats; var. melanogenum from aquatic habitats; var. subglaciale from glacial habitats; and var. namibiae, which was described on the basis of only one strain isolated from dolomitic marble in Namibia. However, when the genome sequences of these varieties became available, the differences between them were considered as too large to be accommodated in a single species. Therefore, the varieties were reclassified as new species: A. pullulans, A. melanogenum, A. subglaciale, and A. namibiae. The genome of A. pullulans s. str. contains large numbers of genes of gene families that can be linked to the nutritional versatility of the species and its stress tolerance. The genome also contains a homothallic mating-type locus. Further genome sequencing of fifty A. pullulans s. str. strains showed that the population of the species is homogeneous, with high levels of recombination and good dispersal. The species A. pullulans was thus recognised as a true generalist, able to inhabit a wide variety of habitats with no specialization to any of these habitats at the genomic level. Despite the presence in the genome of a putative mating locus, and the observation of high recombination rates, no sexual cycle has yet been reported in this organism. Due to the relatively recent redefinition of the species, most published work does not yet distinguish between the new species belonging to the previously recognised A. pullulans species complex. It is therefore not clear to what extent this knowledge is valid for A. pullulans s. str. and what should be attributed to the three new species."
Meloidogyne javanica is a species of plant-pathogenic nematodes. It is one of the tropical root-knot nematodes and a major agricultural pest in many countries. It has many hosts. Meloidogyne javanica reproduces by obligatory mitotic parthenogenesis (apomixis).
"Paratrichodorus minor is a species of nematode in the family Trichodoridae, the stubby-root nematodes. It occurs in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. It damages plants by feeding on the roots and it is a vector of plant viruses. It is a pest of some agricultural crops. Like other stubby-root nematodes, this species is microscopic, reaching up to 0.71 millimeters in length. Its body is rounded at both ends. It has an onchiostyle, a curved, solid stylet which it uses to puncture plant roots. It stabs the plant tissue rapidly, up to 10 times per second, to make a hole. It injects saliva, which hardens into a hollow tube, and it uses this like a drinking straw to withdraw the contents of the plant cells. It moves around the root, leaving old tubes in place and creating new ones. It is an ectoparasite, attacking the plant externally rather than entering its tissues. Damage to plants is evident when it stops the roots from growing, leaving the root system ""stubby""-looking. A plant cannot obtain water and nutrients from the soil and becomes stunted and wilted. It shows signs of nutrient deficiency. An affected crop field may have patches of withered plants. The nematode also introduces viruses to plants, including tobacco rattle virus, which causes the disease corky ringspot in potatoes. A potato tuber with corky ringspot has large brown rings on its surface and discolored spots inside. Entire potato crops can be made unmarketable by the appearance of the disease. The nematode has been observed in over 100 plant hosts, including turfgrasses such as St. Augustine grass and bermudagrass, vegetables such as cabbage and tomato, and other crops such as corn, sorghum, sugarcane, peanut, and soybean. It is a pest of vineyards in California. It is most abundant in coarse soils. Most individuals of the species are female and they reproduce by parthenogenesis, producing offspring without fertilization. They lay eggs in the soil and the juveniles feed on roots as they develop. The length of the life cycle varies with temperature, but it may be as short as 16 days."
"Pratylenchus vulnus (Walnut meadow nematode, or Walnut root-lesion nematode) is a species of plant pathogenic nematodes infecting Persian walnut. It is also known to infest potatoes, apricots, peaches and nectarines, holiday cacti, grape and citruses."
"Saccharomyces cerevisiae (/ˌsɛrəˈvɪsi.iː/) is a species of yeast (single-celled fungus microorganisms). The species has been instrumental in winemaking, baking, and brewing since ancient times. It is believed to have been originally isolated from the skin of grapes. It is one of the most intensively studied eukaryotic model organisms in molecular and cell biology, much like Escherichia coli as the model bacterium. It is the microorganism behind the most common type of fermentation. S. cerevisiae cells are round to ovoid, 5–10 μm in diameter. It reproduces by budding. Many proteins important in human biology were first discovered by studying their homologs in yeast; these proteins include cell cycle proteins, signaling proteins, and protein-processing enzymes. S. cerevisiae is currently the only yeast cell known to have Berkeley bodies present, which are involved in particular secretory pathways. Antibodies against S. cerevisiae are found in 60–70% of patients with Crohn's disease and 10–15% of patients with ulcerative colitis (and 8% of healthy controls). S. cerevisiae has been found to contribute to the smell of bread; the proline and ornithine present in yeast are precursors of the 2-Acetyl-1-pyrroline, a roast‐smelling odorant, in the bread crust."
"Agrobacterium radiobacter (more commonly known as Agrobacterium tumefaciens) is the causal agent of crown gall disease (the formation of tumours) in over 140 species of eudicots. It is a rod-shaped, Gram-negative soil bacterium. Symptoms are caused by the insertion of a small segment of DNA (known as the T-DNA, for 'transfer DNA', not to be confused with tRNA that transfers amino acids during protein synthesis), from a plasmid into the plant cell, which is incorporated at a semi-random location into the plant genome. Plant genomes can be engineered by use of Agrobacterium for the delivery of sequences hosted in T-DNA binary vectors. A. tumefaciens is an alphaproteobacterium of the family Rhizobiaceae, which includes the nitrogen-fixing legume symbionts. Unlike the nitrogen-fixing symbionts, tumor-producing Agrobacterium species are pathogenic and do not benefit the plant. The wide variety of plants affected by Agrobacterium makes it of great concern to the agriculture industry. Economically, A. tumefaciens is a serious pathogen of walnuts, grape vines, stone fruits, nut trees, sugar beets, horse radish, and rhubarb, and the persistent nature of the tumors or galls caused by the disease make it particularly harmful for perennial crops. A. tumefaciens grows optimally at 28 °C. The doubling time can range from 2.5–4h depending on the media, culture format, and level of aeration. At temperatures above 30 °C, A. tumefaciens begins to experience heat shock which is likely to result in errors in cell division."
"Xylella fastidiosa is an aerobic, Gram-negative bacterium of the monotypic genus Xylella. It is a plant pathogen, and is transmitted exclusively by xylem fluid feeding sap insects. Many plant diseases are due to symptomatic infections of X. fastidiosa, including bacterial leaf scorch, oleander leaf scorch, coffee leaf scorch (CLS), alfalfa dwarf, phony peach disease, and the economically important Pierce's disease of grapes (PD) and citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC). In Europe it has attacked olive trees in the Salento area of Southern Italy causing olive quick decline syndrome (OQDS). While distributions of X. fastidiosa–related diseases are mostly limited to the Americas, outbreaks have occurred in Taiwan, Slovakia, and other countries worldwide. Many plants are asymptomatic carriers of the bacteria, which can contribute to its spread. Pathogenicity of the bacterium occurs only when a large proportion of xylem vessels in a plant are colonized; often, the colonies of bacteria themselves are not large enough to completely block the vessels, and the mechanism of pathogenesis is largely unknown. A subspecies of X. fastidiosa responsible for citrus variegated chlorosis was the first non-viral plant pathogen to have its genome sequenced, in part because of its potential to devastate affected crops."
"Torulaspora delbrueckii is a ubiquitous yeast species with both wild and anthropic habitats. The type strain of T. delbrueckii is CBS 1146T, equivalent to CLIB 230 or ATCC 10662, etc.. The type strain of T. delbrueckii CBS 1146 T was recently sequenced, and is composed of 8 chromosomes in addition to a mitochondrial genome. Torulaspora delbrueckii was formerly known as Saccharomyces delbrueckii or Saccharomyces rosei or Saccharomyces roseus, and the anamorph is called Candida colliculosa (for a complete list of synonyms, see CBS's website). Torulaspora delbrueckii is the most studied species of the genus Torulaspora that comprises 8 species to date, including T. franciscae, T. pretoriensis, T. microellipsoides, T. globosa, T. indica, T. maleeae, and T. quercuum. The taxonomy of the genus Torulaspora is evolving rapidly, and the availability of molecular tools to discriminate Torulaspora species will help correcting errors in species assignments."
"Armillaria mellea, commonly known as honey fungus, is a basidiomycete fungus in the genus Armillaria. It is a plant pathogen and part of a cryptic species complex of closely related and morphologically similar species. It causes Armillaria root rot in many plant species and produces mushrooms around the base of trees it has infected. The symptoms of infection appear in the crowns of infected trees as discoloured foliage, reduced growth, dieback of the branches and death. The mushrooms are edible but some people may be intolerant to them. This species is capable of producing light via bioluminescence in its mycelium. Armillaria mellea is widely distributed in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The fruit body or mushroom, commonly known as stump mushroom, stumpie, honey mushroom, pipinky or pinky, grows typically on hardwoods but may be found around and on other living and dead wood or in open areas."
"Aspergillus niger is a fungus and one of the most common species of the genus Aspergillus. It causes a disease called ""black mold"" on certain fruits and vegetables such as grapes, apricots, onions, and peanuts, and is a common contaminant of food. It is ubiquitous in soil and is commonly reported from indoor environments, where its black colonies can be confused with those of Stachybotrys (species of which have also been called ""black mold""). Some strains of A. niger have been reported to produce potent mycotoxins called ochratoxins; other sources disagree, claiming this report is based upon misidentification of the fungal species. Recent evidence suggests some true A. niger strains do produce ochratoxin A. It also produces the isoflavone orobol."
Diplodia seriata is an anamorphic fungus species in the genus Diplodia. It is a cause of bot canker of grapevine in Mexico.
"Grape black rot is a fungal disease caused by an ascomycetous fungus, Guignardia bidwellii, that attacks grape vines during hot and humid weather. “Grape black rot originated in eastern North America, but now occurs in portions of Europe, South America, and Asia. It can cause complete crop loss in warm, humid climates, but is virtually unknown in regions with arid summers.” The name comes from the black fringe that borders growing brown patches on the leaves. The disease also attacks other parts of the plant, “all green parts of the vine: the shoots, leaf and fruit stems, tendrils, and fruit. The most damaging effect is to the fruit”. Grape black rot affects many grape growers throughout the United States, therefore, it is important to understand the disease life cycle and environmental conditions to best manage the disease. Once infection takes place, different methods are available to control the disease."
"Botryosphaeria stevensii is a fungal plant pathogen that causes cankers on several tree species including apple and juniper as well as black dead arm on grape. It causes branch dieback, possibly effecting a large portion of the tree canopy, and if severe it can kill entire plants. Prevention efforts may include careful selection of plants, including resistant cultivars, planting in well-draining loose soils, exposure to light and plant spacing to reduce moisture retention."
"Botryosphaeria obtusa is a plant pathogen that causes frogeye leaf spot, black rot and cankers on many plant species. On the leaf it is referred to as frogeye leaf spot; this phase typically affects tree and shrubs. In fruit such as the apple, cranberry and quince, it is referred to as black rot, and in twigs and trunks it causes cankers."
"Botrytis cinerea is a necrotrophic fungus that affects many plant species, although its most notable hosts may be wine grapes. In viticulture, it is commonly known as ""botrytis bunch rot""; in horticulture, it is usually called ""grey mould"" or ""gray mold"". The fungus gives rise to two different kinds of infections on grapes. The first, grey rot, is the result of consistently wet or humid conditions, and typically results in the loss of the affected bunches. The second, noble rot, occurs when drier conditions follow wetter, and can result in distinctive sweet dessert wines, such as Sauternes or the Aszú of Tokaji/Grasă de Cotnari. The species name Botrytis cinerea is derived from the Latin for ""grapes like ashes""; although poetic, the ""grapes"" refers to the bunching of the fungal spores on their conidiophores, and ""ashes"" just refers to the greyish colour of the spores en masse. The fungus is usually referred to by its anamorph (asexual form) name, because the sexual phase is rarely observed. The teleomorph (sexual form) is an ascomycete, Botryotinia fuckeliana, also known as Botryotinia cinerea (see taxonomy box)."
"Noble rot (French: pourriture noble; German: Edelfäule; Italian: Muffa nobile; Hungarian: Aszúsodás) is the beneficial form of a grey fungus, Botrytis cinerea, affecting wine grapes. Infestation by Botrytis requires moist conditions. If the weather stays wet, the damaging form, ""grey rot"", can destroy crops of grapes. Grapes typically become infected with Botrytis when they are ripe. If they are then exposed to drier conditions and become partially raisined, this form of infection is known as noble rot. Grapes picked at a certain point during infestation can produce particularly fine and concentrated sweet wine. Wines produced by this method are known as botrytized wines."
Pseudopezicula tracheiphila is a species of fungus in the family Helotiaceae that is found in Europe. It is a plant pathogen that affects grapes.
Nectria radicicola is a plant pathogen that is the causal agent of root rot. Substrates include ginseng and Narcissus. It is also implicated in the black foot disease of grapevine.
"Arabis mosaic virus is a viral plant pathogen that is known to infect multiple hosts. The pathogen, commonly referred to as ArMV, is from the family Secoviridae, and it causes yellow dwarf of raspberry and is one of the causes of mosaic of rhubarb. Arabis mosaic virus infects multiple hosts, including strawberries, hops, hemp, grape, geraniums, raspberries, sugar beets, celery, horseradish, lilac, peach, and lettuces."
"Elsinoë ampelina is a plant pathogen, which is the causal agent of anthracnose on grape. This type of anthracnose affects several plant varieties, including some brambles and wine grapes. Grape anthracnose can be identified by the ""bird's eye"" lesions on the berries and sunken black or greyish lesions on leaves and shoots. From these lesions, conidia are produced. This disease can be lethal to the plant, either through defoliation and removal of photosynthetic capacity, or through injury to the active regions of the vine. Grape anthracnose is particularly important to the wine industry, as it can decrease quality and quantity of berries produced as well as kill the vine outright, leading to large economic losses, in particular during the middle summer months."
"Alternaria alternata is a fungus which has been recorded causing leaf spot and other diseases on over 380 host species of plant. It is an opportunistic pathogen on numerous hosts causing leaf spots, rots and blights on many plant parts. It can also cause upper respiratory tract infections and asthma in humans with compromised immunity."
"Botryosphaeria dothidea is a plant pathogen that causes the formation of cankers on a wide variety of tree and shrub species. It has been reported on several hundred plant hosts and on all continents except Antarctica. B. dothidea was redefined in 2004, and some reports of its host range from prior to that time likely include species that have since been placed in another genus. Even so, B. dothidea has since been identified on a number of woody plants—including grape, mango, olive, eucalyptus, maple, and oak, among others—and is still expected to have a broad geographical distribution. While it is best known as a pathogen, the species has also been identified as an endophyte, existing in association with plant tissues on which disease symptoms were not observed. It can colonize some fruits, in addition to woody tissues."
"Lasiodiplodia theobromae is a plant pathogen with a very wide host range. It causes rotting and dieback in most species it infects. It is a common post harvest fungus disease of citrus known as stem-end rot. It is a cause of bot canker of grapevine. It also infects Biancaea sappan, a species of flowering tree also known as Sappanwood. On rare occasions it has been found to cause fungal keratitis, lesions on nail and subcutaneous tissue. It has been implicated in the widespread mortality of baobab (Adansonia digitata) trees in Southern Africa. A preliminary study found the deaths to have a complex set of causes requiring detailed research."
"Plasmopara viticola, the causal agent of grapevine downy mildew, is a heterothallic oomycete that overwinters as oospores in leaf litter and soil. In the spring, oospores germinate to produce macrosporangia, which under wet condition release zoospores. Zoospores are splashed by rain into the canopy, where they swim to and infect through stomata. After 7–10 days, yellow lesions appear on foliage. During favorable weather, the lesions sporulate and new secondary infections occur."
"Tomato ringspot virus (ToRSV) is a plant pathogenic virus of the family Secoviridae. It affects species of cucumber, tobacco, tomato, cowpea, among others. It causes ringspots in tobacco plants and raspberries, yellow bud mosaic in peaches, yellow vein in grapes, and stunted growth in gladiolus and Narcissus. Its range is in the temperate regions of North America, especially where its vector, Xiphinema americanum is present. Along with the adult and larval stages of this nematode, the virus is also spread by seed. This type of infection is more common in strawberries and soybeans than any other susceptible plant."

"Brettanomyces is a non-spore forming genus of yeast in the family Saccharomycetaceae, and is often colloquially referred to as ""Brett"". The genus name Dekkera is used interchangeably with Brettanomyces, as it describes the teleomorph or spore forming form of the yeast. The cellular morphology of the yeast can vary from ovoid to long ""sausage"" shaped cells. The yeast is acidogenic, and when grown on glucose rich media under aerobic conditions, produces large amounts of acetic acid. Brettanomyces is important to both the brewing and wine industries due to the sensory compounds it produces. In the wild, Brettanomyces lives on the skins of fruit."
"Vin Mariani (French: Mariani wine) was a coca wine and patent medicine created in the 1860s by Angelo Mariani, a French chemist from the island of Corsica. Mariani became intrigued with coca and its medical and economic potential after reading Paolo Mantegazza's paper on the effects of coca. Between 1863 and 1868 Mariani started marketing a coca wine called Vin Tonique Mariani (à la Coca du Pérou) which was made from Bordeaux wine and coca leaves. The ethanol in the wine acted as a solvent and extracted the cocaine from the coca leaves, altering the drink's effect. It originally contained 6 mg of cocaine per fluid ounce of wine (211.2 mg/L), but Vin Mariani that was to be exported contained 7.2 mg per ounce (253.4 mg/L), in order to compete with the higher cocaine content of similar drinks in the United States. Advertisements for Vin Mariani claimed that it would restore health, strength, energy and vitality."
"Drakshasava (Sanskrit: द्राक्षासव) is a traditional Ayurvedic tonic made from grapes. Drakshasava is a weak wine because the grape juice is usually only partially fermented. It is also sometimes prepared by using raisin concentrate. The tonic is claimed to be beneficial for maladies such as lethargy, weakness and heat exhaustion. Drakshasava is believed to address health imbalances arising from an excess of the Vata-Vayu Dosha and is said to be useful in curing cardiac disorders and hemorrhoids in the Ayurvedic system."

"Ampeloglypter ater, the grape cane girdler, is a true weevil species in the genus Ampeloglypter. It is a pest infecting grapevine."
"Grape phylloxera is an insect pest of commercial grapevines worldwide, originally native to eastern North America. Grape phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae (Fitch 1855) belong to the family Phylloxeridae, within the order Hemiptera, bugs); originally described in France as Phylloxera vastatrix; equated to the previously described Daktulosphaera vitifoliae, Phylloxera vitifoliae. The insect is commonly just called phylloxera (/fɪˈlɒksərə/; from Ancient Greek: φύλλον, leaf, and ξηρός, dry). These almost microscopic, pale yellow sap-sucking insects, related to aphids, feed on the roots and leaves of grapevines (depending on the phylloxera genetic strain). On Vitis vinifera, the resulting deformations on roots (""nodosities"" and ""tuberosities"") and secondary fungal infections can girdle roots, gradually cutting off the flow of nutrients and water to the vine. Nymphs also form protective galls on the undersides of grapevine leaves of some Vitis species and overwinter under the bark or on the vine roots; these leaf galls are typically only found on the leaves of American vines. American vine species (such as Vitis labrusca) have evolved to have several natural defenses against phylloxera. The roots of the American vines exude a sticky sap that repels the nymph form by clogging its mouth when it tries to feed from the vine. If the nymph is successful in creating a feeding wound on the root, American vines respond by forming a protective layer of tissue to cover the wound and protect it from secondary bacterial or fungal infections. Currently there is no cure for phylloxera and unlike other grape diseases such as powdery or downy mildew, there is no chemical control or response. The only successful means of controlling phylloxera has been the grafting of phylloxera-resistant American rootstock (usually hybrid varieties created from the Vitis berlandieri, Vitis riparia and Vitis rupestris species) to more susceptible European vinifera vines."
"Meloidogyne incognita (root-knot nematode - RKN), also known as the ""southern root-nematode"" or ""cotton root-knot nematode"" is a plant-parasitic roundworm in the family Heteroderidae. This nematode is one of the four most common species worldwide and has numerous hosts. It typically incites large, usually irregular galls on roots as a result of parasitism. Meloidogyne incognita can move along shallower temperature gradients (0.001C/cm) than any other known organism, an example of thermotaxis. The response is complicated and thought to allow the nematodes to move toward an appropriate level in soil, while they search for chemical cues that can guide them to specific roots."
"Tylenchorhynchus is a genus of nematodes including many species of plant parasites. The classification of stunt nematodes - those including the genus Tylenchorhynchus - is unstable; many newly discovered species within this genus are reconsidered to be actually subspecies. Stunt nematodes such as Tylenchorhynchus and the closely related genera, Anguillulina and Merlinia, include more than 250 known species. Members of these genera possess similar anatomy and may be easily mistaken for one another. Some debate has led to the classification of single species under different names in two distinct genera (e.g. Tylenchorhynchus cylindricus is Anguillulina dubia)."
"Meloidogyne arenaria is a species of plant pathogenic nematodes. This nematode is also known as the peanut root knot nematode. The word ""Meloidogyne"" is derived from two Greek words that mean ""apple-shaped"" and ""female"". The peanut root knot nematode, M. arenaria is one of the ""major"" Meloidogyne species because of its worldwide economic importance. M. arenaria is a predominant nematode species in the United States attacking peanut in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Texas. The most damaging nematode species for peanut in the USA is M. arenaria race 1 and losses can exceed 50% in severely infested fields. Among the several Meloidogyne species that have been characterized, M. arenaria is the most variable both morphologically and cytologically. In 1949, two races of this nematode had been identified, race 1 which reproduces on peanut and race 2 which cannot do so. However, in a recent study, three races were described (races 1, 2, and 3). López-Pérez et al (2011) had also studied populations of M. arenaria race 2, which reproduces on tomato plants carrying the Mi gene and race 3, which reproduces on both resistant pepper and tomato."

"Xiphinema americanum, the American dagger nematode, is a species of plant pathogenic nematodes. It is one of many species that belongs to the genus Xiphinema. It was first described by N. A. Cobb in 1913, who found it on both sides of the United States on the roots of grass, corn, and citrus trees. Not only is Xiphinema americanum known to vector plant viruses, but also X. americanum has been referred to as ""the most destructive plant parasitic nematode in America"", and one of the four major nematode pests in the Southeastern United States."
"Tylenchulus semipenetrans (Citrus nematode, Citrus root nematode) is a species of plant pathogenic nematodes and the causal agent of slow decline of citrus. T. semipenetrans is found in most citrus production areas and diverse soil textures worldwide. Their feeding strategy is semi-endoparasitic and has a very narrow host range among commonly grown crops. These nematodes are considered as major plant-parasitic nematode because they can cause 10-30% losses reported on citrus trees. They also parasitize other hosts such as olive, grape, persimmon and lilac. The citrus nematode was first discovered in California in 1913 by J.R. Hodges and was later described and named by Nathan Cobb that year."

The 700-year-old indigenous craft is native to the Surendranagar district, of Saurashtra-region of the state. Traditional variations like Ramraj, Charmalia, Dhunslu, and Lobdi are woven in village clusters of Dedara, Vastadi, Godavari and Vadla in the district. The textile is usually used as shawl and wraparound skirt by women of the Bharwad shepherd community of the Wankaner, Amreli, Dehgam, Surendranagar, Joravarnagar, Botad, Bhavnagar and Kutch areas."
"Nakshi kantha, a type of embroidered quilt, is a centuries-old Bengali art tradition of the Bengal region, notable in Bangladesh and Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura and part of Assam. The basic material used is thread and old cloth. Nakshi kanthas are made throughout Bangladesh, but the greater Mymensingh, Jamalpur, Bogra, Rajshahi, Faridpur and Jessore areas are most famous for this craft. The colourful patterns and designs that are embroidered resulted in the name ""Nakshi Kantha"", which was derived from the Bengali word ""naksha"", which refers to artistic patterns. The early kanthas had a white background accented with red, blue and black embroidery; later yellow, green, pink and other colours were also included. The running stitch called ""kantha stitch"" is the main stitch used for the purpose. Traditionally, kantha was produced for the use of the family. Today, after the revival of the nakshi kantha, they are produced commercially."
"Blue Pottery is widely recognized as a traditional craft of Jaipur of Central Asian origin. The name 'blue pottery' comes from the eye-catching cobalt blue dye used to color the pottery. It is one of many Eurasian types of blue and white pottery, and related in the shapes and decoration to Islamic pottery and, more distantly, Chinese pottery. Jaipur blue pottery, made out of a similar frit material to faience, is glazed and low-fired. No clay is used: the 'dough' for the pottery is prepared by mixing quartz stone powder, powdered glass, Multani Mitti (Fuller's Earth), borax, gum and water. Another source cites Katira Gond powder (a gum), and saaji (soda bicarbonate) as ingredients. Some of this pottery is semi-transparent and mostly decorated with bird and other animal motifs. Being fired at very low temperature makes them fragile. The range of items is primarily decorative, such as ashtrays, vases, coasters, small bowls and boxes for trinkets. The colour palette is restricted to blue derived from the cobalt oxide, green from the copper oxide and white, though other non-conventional colours, such as yellow and brown are sometimes included."
"Patachitra or Pattachitra is a general term for traditional, cloth-based scroll painting, based in the eastern Indian states of Odisha and West Bengal. Patachitra artform is known for its intricate details as well as mythological narratives and folktales inscribed in it. Pattachitra is one of the ancient artworks of Odisha, originally created for ritual use and as souvenirs for pilgrims to Puri, as well as other temples in Odisha. Patachitras are a component of an ancient Bengali narrative art, originally serving as a visual device during the performance of a song."
"Tracht (German pronunciation: [ˈtʁaxt]) refers to traditional garments in German-speaking countries and regions. Although the word is most often associated with Bavarian, Austrian, South Tyrolian and Trentino garments, including lederhosen and dirndls, many other German-speaking peoples have them, as did the former Danube Swabian populations of Central Europe."
Kota Doria or Kota Doriya is the name of a light woven fabric made of tiny woven squares (khat) which is still handwoven on traditional pit looms in Kaithoon near Kota in Rajasthan and in some of the surrounding villages. Kota Doriya Sarees are made of pure cotton and silk and have square like patterns known as khats on them. The chequered weave of a Kota sari is very popular. They are very fine weaves and weigh very little.
"A Banarasi sari is a sari made in Varanasi, an ancient city which is also called Benares (Banaras). The saris are among the finest saris in India and are known for their gold and silver brocade or zari, fine silk and opulent embroidery. The saris are made of finely woven silk and are decorated with intricate design, and, because of these engravings, are relatively heavy. Their special characteristics intricate intertwining floral and foliate motifs, kalga and bel, a string of upright leaves called jhallar at the outer, edge of border is a characteristic of these saris. Other features are gold work, compact weaving, figures with small details, metallic visual effects, pallus, jal (a net like pattern), and mina work. The saris are often part of an Indian bride's trousseau. Depending on the intricacy of its designs and patterns, a sari can take from 15 days to a month and sometimes up to six months to complete. Banarasi saris are mostly worn by Indian women on important occasions such as when attending a wedding and are expected to be complemented by the woman's best jewelry."
"Beef à la mode, or bœuf à la mode (""beef in style""), is a French version of what is known in the United States as pot roast. It is a way to prepare a tougher cut of beef (rich in connective tissue, and in older recipes often larded).The French culinary phrase à la mode used in the name of this dish is also encountered in other dishes such as Pie à la Mode. The dish is prepared by first browning the beef in oil, lard, or bacon fat. Some recipes include a preliminary marinating step, where the beef is marinated in a combination of wine and brandy before browning.The browned beef is then braised in a liquid composed primarily of red wine with garlic and root vegetables (usually celery, carrots and onions) and herbs such as thyme, bay, or celery seed. Many recipes add tomatoes or canned tomato sauce, while others add beef broth and/or brandy or other distilled spirits. In some older recipes the addition of a calf's foot or soup bones would add gelatin to the braising liquid, which serves to thicken the resulting sauce. To finish the dish, the braised beef is removed and set aside to rest. Meanwhile, the braising liquid is strained and reduced to a sauce. The beef is then sliced and served with the sauce made from the braising liquid."
"Plum jerkum is an alcoholic drink produced from plums. It has been variously described as made in the same way as cider and as a fruit wine, although the terminology implies slightly different methods. The drink is native to the north Cotswolds and particularly to the county of Worcestershire, where plum cultivation was once centred on Pershore and the Vale of Evesham; it was also found around Chipping Campden in Gloucestershire. Jerkum was known as a traditional product of Worcester along with potted lamperns and curd cheesecakes. A 19th-century reference, again from Worcester, suggests that it was often taken mixed with cider to reduce its strength: ""plum jerkum is [...] the fermented juice of plums, and is a very heady liquor. In the country they often mix it with cider, and thus moderate its effect [...] A man who was brought before the Pershore magistrates on a charge of drunkenness confessed he had a drop too much of it. Perhaps he took it neat"". The jerkum made around Chipping Campden was made, for preference, from a dark bullace-like plum found in the area's villages: however it ranged in colour from ""a deep purple to a claret red"", and in flavour ""from a sticky sweetness to a sparkling tartness"" depending on the type of plum used. The Worcestershire author and farmer Fred Archer mentions jerkum several times in his stories of rural life, as does John Moore in his books set around a fictionalised Bredon Hill. Some aficionados in American craft beverages have started to use ""jerkum"" as a broader term encompassing the alcoholic drink produced from any unadulterated fermented stone fruit (e.g., nectarine, peach, apricot, pluot)."
"A bota bag is a traditional Spanish liquid receptacle, used mainly as a wineskin. It is often made out of leather (when made of goatskin it is known as a goatskin itself), and is typically used to carry wine, although any liquid can be filled into it. Often referred to as a canteen."

"Rockview Dam is a zoned earth-fill/rock-fill type dam located on the Palmiet River near Grabouw, Western Cape, South Africa. It was established in 1986 and serves mainly for pumping purposes (storage). The hazard potential of the dam has been ranked high (3)."
"Kogelberg Dam is a combined gravity & arch type dam located on the Palmiet River, near Grabouw, Western Cape, South Africa. It was established in 1986 and its primary purpose is to serve for irrigation and industrial use. The hazard potential of the dam has been ranked high (3)."
"The Geoponica or Geoponika (Greek: Γεωπονικά) is a twenty-book collection of agricultural lore, compiled during the 10th century in Constantinople for the Byzantine emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus. The Greek word Geoponica signifies ""agricultural pursuits"" in its widest sense. It is the only surviving Byzantine agricultural work. During the Macedonian Renaissance, the emperor Constantine VII assembled several compendia - compilations and excerpts of ancient writings - of which Geoponika was one. Around 50 manuscripts, dating from between the 10th and 16th centuries, have survived. Geoponika incorporated the work of Cassianus Bassus, which was compiled from an earlier work by Vindonius Anatolius."
"The Speyer wine bottle (or Römerwein) is a sealed vessel, presumed to contain liquid wine, and so named because it was unearthed from a Roman tomb found near Speyer, Germany. It is considered the world's oldest known bottle of wine."
"Ullage (from the French ouillage) is a winemaking term that has several meanings but most commonly refers to the headspace of air between wine and the top of the container holding the wine. It can also refer to the process of evaporation that creates the headspace itself or it can be used as a past tense verb to describe a wine barrel or bottle that has gone through the evaporation process (to be ullaged, etc.). The headspace of air is a mixture mostly of alcohol and water vapors with carbon dioxide that is a by-product of the fermentation process. In containers that are not completely air-tight (such as an oak wine barrel or a cork-stoppered wine bottle), oxygen can also seep into this space. While some oxygen is beneficial to the aging process of wine, excessive amounts can lead to oxidation and other various wine faults. This is why wine in the barrels is regularly ""topped up"" and refilled to the top with wine in order to minimize the head space. In the bottle, the ullage or ""fill level"" of the wine can be an important indicator of the kind of care and storage conditions that the wine was kept in. After-market resellers and wine auction houses will often inspect the ullage levels of older vintages to determine the potential quality and value of wine."
"A muselet (French: [myz.le]) is a wire cage that fits over the cork of a bottle of champagne, sparkling wine or beer to prevent the cork from emerging under the pressure of the carbonated contents. It derives its name from the French museler, to muzzle. The muselet often has a metal cap incorporated in the design which may show the drink maker's emblem. They are normally covered by a metal foil envelope. Muselets are also known as wirehoods or Champagne wires."
"The Bocksbeutel is a type of wine bottle with the form of a flattened ellipsoid. It is commonly used for wines from Franconia in Germany, but is also used for some Portuguese wines, in particular rosés, where the bottle is called cantil, and in rare cases for Italian wine (in this case called pulcianella) and Greek wine."
"Wine labels are important sources of information for consumers since they tell the type and origin of the wine. The label is often the only resource a buyer has for evaluating the wine before purchasing it. Certain information is ordinarily included in the wine label, such as the country of origin, quality, type of wine, alcoholic degree, producer, bottler, or importer. In addition to these national labeling requirements producers may include their web site address and a QR Code with vintage specific information."
"Sealed bottles have an applied glass seal on the shoulder or side of the bottle. The seal is a molten blob of glass that has been stamped with an embossed symbol, name or initials, and often it included a date. Collectors of bottles sometimes refer to them as Applied seals, Blob seals or Prunt seals. Up until the 17th century bottles would have been made of pottery or leather but by the middle of the century a 'new' black/dark green glass wine bottle came into general use. Early glass bottles were squat, broad and rounded sometimes referred to as ""onion bottles"". Around 1636 English law prohibited the sale of wine by the 'bottle' in England, according to Jancis Robinson's Oxford Encyclopedia of Wine. Individuals were encouraged to have private bottles made carrying their own seals which they then took to a wine merchant who filled them with wine from a cask using a liquid measure."

"The Castle of Grinzane Cavour is a fortification in Grinzane Cavour, Piedmont, northern Italy. On 22 June 2014, the castle of Grinzane Cavour was inscribed on UNESCO World Heritage list."
"Mikulov Castle is in the town of Mikulov in South Moravia, Czech Republic. The castle stands on a place of historic Slavonic settlement, where since the end of the 13th century the original stone castle was erected. The present castle is the result of a reconstruction in 1719–1730 under the princes of Dietrichstein. The end of World War II meant a complete disaster for the castle, as German troops withdrawing from the town set fire to it. During the war, the anthropological collection from the Moravské zemské muzeum had been moved to Mikulov Castle for safekeeping purposes. Many of the most important discoveries from Předmostí u Přerova, Dolní Věstonice and the Mladeč caves were destroyed by the fire. After an extensive reconstruction in the 1950s, the castle became the seat of the Regional Museum in Mikulov, housing art and historical collections, including artifacts relating to the history of local wine production. The Renaissance wine barrel, dating from 1643 and one of the largest, 1,014 hectolitres (22,300 imp gal; 26,800 US gal), wine barrels in Central Europe, is on display."
"A cantina is a type of bar common in Latin America and Spain. The word is similar in etymology to ""canteen"", and is derived from the Italian word for a cellar, winery, or vault. In Italy, the word cantina refers to a room below the ground level where wine and other products such as salami are stored. As cantine it was used to refer to the shop of a sutler, an army camp follower."
"A wine list is a menu of wine selections for purchase, typically in a restaurant setting. A restaurant may include a list of available wines on its main menu, but usually provides a separate menu just for wines. Wine lists in the form of tasting menus and wines for purchase are also offered by wineries and wine stores. A restaurant's sommelier is usually in charge of assembling the wine list, educating the staff about wine, and assisting customers with their wine selections. Wine lists have been found from ancient Egyptian times. Ancient wine lists were not created for the same purpose served by a menu, but rather as a means of recording inventory and administrating wine rations in a monarch's household."
"A Strausse or Strausswirtschaft (also Strauße or Straußwirtschaft) is a type of wine tavern in winegrowing areas of German-speaking countries that is only open during certain times of the year. Typically it is a pub run by winegrowers and winemakers themselves, in which they sell their own wine directly to the public. The food served needs to be simple, regional cold dishes. Other expressions like Besenwirtschaft and Besenschänke (""broom pub""), Rädlewirtschaft (""cyclists' pub"") as well as Hecken- or Häckerwirtschaft are also common."
"Wine caves are subterranean structures for the storage and the aging of wine. They are an integral component of the wine industry worldwide. The design and construction of wine caves represents a unique application of underground construction techniques. The storage of wine in extensive underground space is an extension of the culture of wine cellar rooms, both offering the benefits of energy efficiency and optimum use of limited land area. Wine caves naturally provide both high humidity and cool temperatures, which are key to the storage and aging of wine."
"The Giant Cask or Giant Barrel (German: Riesenfass, locally just Fass or, in the local Palatine dialect, the Därgemer Fass), is a tourist attraction in the Palatine spa and district town of Bad Dürkheim in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. The wine barrel has a diameter of 13.5 metres, a volume of about 1,700,000 litres or 1,700 m³ and is thus the largest cask in the world. However, it is not used for the storage of wine, but houses a restaurant."
"Mangalore tiles (also Mangalorean tiles) are a type of tile native to the city of Mangalore, India. Typically considered to be a part of Spanish and Italian architectural styles, the tiles were first introduced to India in 1860 by a German missionary. Since that time, the industry has flourished in India with these red tiles, prepared from hard laterite clay, in great demand throughout the country. They are exported to Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and the Far East and even as far as East Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and Australia. These were the only tiles recommended for government buildings in India under the British Raj. These tiles still define Mangalore's skyline and characterize its urban setting. They are a popular form of roofing and are preferred over concrete due to their good quality."
"The Wine Museum (Bulgarian: Музей на виното, Muzey na vinoto) is a museum of wine and viticulture located in Pleven, a city in north central Bulgaria. Opened on 17 September 2008, the museum occupies a natural cave in Pleven's Kaylaka park, about 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) from the city centre. The museum was the result of a collaboration between Bulgarian and French architects, designers and oenologists, as well as curators from the Pleven Panorama and the Pleven Regional Historical Museum. The cave which houses the museum is near the Totleben's Rampart Reservoir, and has five galleries and a total area of 650 square metres (7,000 sq ft). The Wine Museum's collection includes over 6,000 bottles of Bulgarian wine from all viticultural regions of the country, which are available for tasting and purchase. In addition, the museum boasts the country's largest collection of over 7,000 old wines (ranging from 30 to 90 years in age). The museum's historical hall exhibits items related to vine growing and wine making in the Bulgarian lands from ancient Thracian times until today. The wine cellar offers wines from all Bulgarian regions stored in 100 wine barrels made of French oak. The museum's wine collection is owned by Plamen Petkov, a major local vineyard owner, who has invested over $300,000 in temperature control systems, flooring and lighting for the cave which houses the museum. Pleven is located in the heart of a major vine-growing region, the Danubian Plain. The city is also a centre of wine-related education, as it is the home of Bulgaria's first and only specialized high school, the Aleksandar Stamboliyski Professional High School of Vine Growing and Wine Making, established in 1890. The National Institute of Viticulture and Oenology, founded in 1902 at the recommendation of French wine specialist Pierre Viala, is also located in Pleven."
"Khandua (Also Maniabandi or Kataki) is a traditional ""bandha"" or ikat sari produced from Odishaworn by women during wedding and a special type of which is worn by Jagannath.The clothes contain texts of Gita Govinda on them. Kenduli Khandua, a special form of Khandua of 12 ft and 2 kani (each kani measures the length of a hand) is offered to Jagannath to wear as khandua with stanzas and illustration from Gita Govinda."
"The Gamosa ([ɡamʊsa]) or Gamusa (Assamese: গামোচা) is an article of significance for the indigenous people of Assam, India. It is generally a white rectangular piece of cloth with primarily a red border on three sides and red woven motifs on the fourth (in addition to red, other colors are also used). Although cotton yarn is the most common material for making/weaving gamosas, there are special occasion ones made from Pat silk. A 1,455.3 meter long Gamusa displayed in Delhi created world record as it became the world's longest hand woven piece of cloth."
"Kvevri (Georgian: ქვევრი [kʰvɛvri]; also known as churi (ჭური) in Western Georgia) are large earthenware vessels used for the fermentation, storage and ageing of traditional Georgian wine. Resembling large, egg-shaped amphorae without handles, they are either buried below ground or set into the floors of large wine cellars. Kvevris vary in size: volumes range from 20 litres to around 10,000; 800 is typical. Archaeological excavations in the southern Georgian region of Kvemo Kartli (notably at Dangreuli Gora, Gadachrili Gora and in the village of Imiri) uncovered evidence of grape pips and kvevris dating back to the 6th millennium B.C. The villages of Atsana in Guria; Makatubani, Shrosha, Tq'emlovana and Chkhiroula in Imereti; and Vardisubani in Kakheti are traditional kvevri-making areas. Artisanal families have passed down the knowledge of this ancient handicraft through the generations. The clay used to manufacture a Kvevri must be carefully chosen, as its characteristics will influence the wine's mineral content. The process of making wine in Kvevri involves pressing the grapes and then pouring the juice, grape skins, stalks and pips into the Kvevri, which is then sealed. The juice is then left to ferment into wine for at least five to six months before being decanted and bottled. The pomace (mash of pips, skins and stalks) which remains is called chacha in Georgian. It is distilled into brandy which is also called chacha. The empty Kvevri is then washed, sterilized with lime and re-coated with beeswax, ready to be filled again. Traditional Georgian wines do not represent a uniform style. A common feature is that their vinification is carried in Kvevri completely buried in the ground, so that even the outlet neck of it remains below ground level. The most unusual and archaic, out of the traditional Georgian wines are white Kakhetian wine (also known as orange or amber wine), macerated for several months with the skins, seeds and stems of grapes in buried Kvevri. “Kakhetian method"" is an extreme current of Georgian wine making tradition, while the moderate faction represents the so-called ""Imeretian method"". From ""Kakhetian method, it differs in amount and quality of the chacha (pomace) used. The Imeretian method uses only part of the chacha, roughly one-tenth, and stems are not used at all. The rest of the production process proceeds in basically the same. The result is a wine much closer to European standards, not as tannic as the traditional Kakhetian wine, although in this case a long maturation in Kvevri gives them the undisputed Georgian stigma. Intermediate place between the Kakhetian style and Imeretian style represents the traditional white wine from province Kartli (Central Georgia), where the one third of chacha with stems is added to Kvevri. In the past, Kvevri were also used for storing brandy, grain, butter, cheese and a variety of other perishable foodstuffs, although in Georgia they have always been primarily used for wine-making. Large ceramic storage vessels such as these are made in many countries, but only Georgia, Spain (vino de tinaja, vino de pitarra) and Portugal (vinho de talha) use them for wine-making. Wine-makers who use Kvevri claim that their wine is stable by nature, rich in tannins, and that it does not require chemical preservatives to ensure long life and superior taste. The tannins found in kvevri wine limit protein content and prevent turbidity. Since the Russian market for Georgian wine has dwindled to a trickle, Georgia has revived this ancient method of wine-making and is exciting interest around the world. Various commercial wineries in Georgia export kvevri wines abroad, and some wine-makers in Europe and America have taken to making their wine in kvevris. Kvevri and the tradition of wine-making in kvevri was inscribed on the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Georgia registry in 2011. In 2013, UNESCO added the traditional Georgian method of making wine in kvevris to its list of intangible cultural heritage."
"Arbor Mist is the brand name of an alcoholic beverage which blends wines such as Merlot, Zinfandel and Chardonnay with fruit flavourings and high fructose corn syrup. Its slogan is ""Great Tasting Wine with a Splash of Fruit."" Arbor Mist has a lower alcohol content than most wines, and is usually cheaper than other similar alcoholic beverages. It is made by the Arbor Mist Winery in Canandaigua, New York, and is packaged by E&J Gallo Winery."
"California Cooler is a brand of alcoholic beverage. Although sangria has existed since wine has been made, this formula and packaging was the first to be known as a wine cooler. The product was essentially a sangria packaged in a 12 fl. oz. glass bottle. Originally named Canada Cooler, the California Cooler package was re-designed by Glenn Martinez and Assoc. The California Cooler eventually was also sold in a 2-liter bottle. The original California Cooler exploded on the beverage market after its founding in 1976, when Lodi High School friends, Michael Crete and R. Stuart Bewley, and their original partners (mostly friends and family) raised $140,000 to begin commercial production. By 1985, it was selling a reported 12.3 million cases a year worth $125 million. In 1985, Crete and Bewley sold the company to liquor giant Brown-Forman Inc. in a deal valued up to $146 million. Brown Forman were national distributors of wine and spirits brands such as Jack Daniels and Korbel Sparkling wines. Soon after competition began from wine maker giants E&J Gallo Winery who started strong marketing of its Bartles & Jaymes coolers and Seagram's own brand of wine coolers, California Cooler's market share began to slide. The cooler craze of the mid-eighties was celebrated with an Ad campaign by Chiat Day ""The Chairman""(Kailo Messier) featuring beach life scenes. Bartles & Jaymes, the second entrant into the wine cooler marketplace quickly came and took market share. Their ad campaign featured two actors playing the fictitious Frank Bartles and Ed Jaymes ""Bartles and Jaymes"" saying ""thank you for your support"". Overall wine-cooler sales dropped 98 percent in 1987 from 1976. California Cooler volume had dropped to 5 million cases, less than one-third of what Seagram's and Gallo each were moving. On 30 March 2007, Majestic Brands, a Danville beverage company, announced plans to try to revive the California Cooler brand."
"American Winery Guide (AWG) is an online compendium of wineries in the United States. Founded by Jim Finley and Tim Donahoe in 2007, American Winery Guide catalogues and maps American wineries by state and viticultural area. The guide lists the address, owner, winemaker, founding date, hours of operation, tasting fees, and production statistics for over 7,500 wineries. Additionally, American Winery Guide employs correspondents who write articles about wineries in an area. In 2013, American Winery Guide partnered with CellarPass and VinoVisit, two winery reservation services, to allow customers to search for wineries on American Winery Guide's website, and then book a wine tasting or winery tour using the reservation companies."
"Vinography is a wine blog dedicated to wine reviews, restaurant reviews, news, and commentary about the world of wine. It was started by Alder Yarrow in January 2004, and has been described by The Independent as an interesting source of wine related info from the San Francisco Bay area. It receives some of the highest web traffic of any wine blog. The blog has been noted by Food & Wine Magazine and The Wall Street Journal for its popularity and comprehensiveness. The blog's author and founder, Alder Yarrow, is a graduate of Stanford University and founded an interactive design and strategy consulting firm in San Francisco. The name is a portmanteau of vino, the Latin root meaning ""wine"", and the Greek word graphein, meaning ""write""."
"The Heidelberg Tun (German: Großes Fass), or Great Heidelberg Tun, is an extremely large wine vat contained within the cellars of Heidelberg Castle. There have been four such barrels in the history of Heidelberg. In 1751, the year of its construction, the present one had a capacity of 221,726 litres (58,574 U.S. gallons). Due to the drying of the wood its current capacity is 219,000 litres (57,854 U.S. gallons). One hundred and thirty oak trees were reputedly used in its construction. It has only rarely been used as a wine barrel, and in fact presently enjoys more use as a tourist attraction, and also as a dance floor since one was constructed on top of the tun."
"Oak is used in winemaking to vary the color, flavor, tannin profile and texture of wine. It can be introduced in the form of a barrel during the fermentation or aging periods, or as free-floating chips or staves added to wine fermented in a vessel like stainless steel. Oak barrels can impart other qualities to wine through evaporation and low level exposure to oxygen."
"Bottling lines are production lines that fill a product, generally a beverage, into bottles on a large scale. Many prepared foods are also bottled, such as sauces, syrups, marinades, oils and vinegars."
"Aranmula kannadi, meaning the Aranmula mirror, is a handmade metal-alloy mirror, made in Aranmula, a small town in Pathanamthitta, Kerala, India. Unlike the normal ""silvered"" glass mirrors, it is a metal-alloy mirror or first surface mirror or front surface reflection mirror, which eliminates secondary reflections and aberrations typical of back surface mirrors. The exact metals used in the alloy are maintained as a family secret. Metallurgists suggest that the alloy is a mix of copper and tin [Srinivasan 2008]. It is polished for several days to achieve the mirror's reflective surface. They are considered to be one of the eight auspicious items or ""ashtamangalyam"" that play a role in the entry of the bride at a wedding venue [3,4]. These unique metal mirrors are the result of Kerala's rich cultural and metallurgical traditions. They have great historical and cultural value and are thought to bring good luck. They are produced by one extended family in Aranmula. The origins of the Aranmula kannadi are linked to the Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple. According to legend, centuries ago the royal chief brought eight families of experts in temple arts and crafts from Tirunelveli district to Aranmula to work on the mirrors in the Parthasarathy temple. The British Museum in London has an Aranmula metal mirror 45 centimeters tall in its collection. The mirrors received a geographical indication (GI) tag in 2004-05."
"The Thanjavur doll is a type of traditional Indian bobblehead or roly-poly toy made of terracotta material. The centre of gravity and total weight of the doll is concentrated at its bottom-most point, generating a dance-like continuous movement with slow oscillations. These toys are traditionally handmade, finished with detailed, painted exteriors. They have been recognized as a Geographical Indication by the Government of India as of 2008-09."
"The Belly Amphora in the Staatliche Antikensammlungen at Munich (inventory number 2301) is one of the most famous works by the Andokides Painter. The vase measures 53.5 cm high and 22.5 cm in diameter. It dates to between 520 and 510 BC and was discovered at Vulci. It was acquired by , an agent of Ludwig I of Bavaria. As a bilingual vase, it is an important archaeological source for the transition from attic black-figure pottery to the red-figure style. Bilingual vases are uncommon, and ones that repeat the same subject in the two styles are vanishingly rare; the vase is therefore very often used to illustrate the differences between the two techniques. It is signed by the potter Andokides, who probably made it. Some scholars assume that the black-figure side was painted by the Lysippides Painter, while others suggest that he is identical with the Andokides Painter."

Other examples have been found at Berenike in Egypt, where the amphoras date firmly to an early 5th century context in what may be the best stratified examples (Hayes 1996: 159-61); from Aqaba in Jordan where many examples have been found, including their kilns; on The Shipwreck at Black Assarca Island, Eritrea (Pedersen 2008; Pedersen 2000); and in the Mediterranean such as on the late 6th-century shipwreck at Iskandil Burnu, Turkey, as well as in Spain and Carthage in strata datable from the mid-fourth to the sixth centuries (Keay 1986: 356, 358, 471).

He was the seventh child in a family of 4 sons and 3 daughters raised by August Wilhelm Langschmidt (*8 June 1754), a wealthy merchant of Grabow, and his wife Dorothea Elisabeth Höpcker (*6 September 1774). Wilhelm was expected to take up the profession of merchant, but showed little interest in such a career, and instead had a great passion for painting. In 1826 he turned to the Mecklenburg Grand Duke Friedrich Franz for support, but was rejected. For a while he studied in Berlin under Prof. Kretsch, and decided to emigrate to South Africa, but not before marrying Dorothea Ahrens from Ludwigslust, 18 years his junior. The couple landed in Cape Town on 2 March 1840, where Langschmidt lived and worked until 1851. He was active as a miniaturist, and portrait and landscape painter, working mainly in oils, pastels and chalks. He also ran drawing classes and was a competent lithographer. A supporter of the Anti-Convict movement, he destroyed a portrait he had painted of the Governor, Sir Harry Smith, at an anti-convict meeting. Returning to his merchant roots in 1856, Langschmidt bought the farm ""Grietjiesgat"" and started a trading store, around which in due course the town of Grabouw grew, named for his German hometown.Langschmidt is assumed to have eventually retired to his farm ""Gustrow"", also near Elgin in the Western Cape. He had at least 18 children, some sources citing 23, including 3 sets of twins. Langschmidt's great, great grandson is the Cape Town artist and whale conservationist, Noel Ashton.

"The Horsehead Amphora is a specific type of amphora, produced in Athens from about 600 BC onwards. They are vessels with a very pronounced belly, decorated with black figure horseheads on both sides. In a single case, one side depicts a woman’s head. In contrast to earlier , the painters did not apply a separate frieze on the neck. The decoration was painted within reserved rectangular panels; the remaining vase of the body was painted black. More than 100 such amphorae are known; they were painted by a variety of artists, including ones of mediocre quality. The amphorae appear to have had a specific meaning or purpose, remains elusive to modern scholarship. Some scholars have suggested that they were grave vases, but not a single specimen was found in a grave context. Should that interpretation be correct, the horses may be connected with Hades, or be symbols of Poseidon in an unusual role as god of the underworld. A further possibility is that the vases served as victory prizes. Erika Simon proposed that they were typical votive dedications using by the Athenian nobility, who also provided the state’s cavalry. In that case, the horsehead would be a symbol of social standing. According to John D. Beazley, the vases were part of the Athenian vase painters' repertoire for less than half a century. No stylistic development can be detected. It is possible that they were precursors to the Panathenaic prize amphorae. The is named for his habit of painting horsehead amphorae."

In the United States he found work with Augustus Saint-Gaudens, with whom he remained five years; a fellow worker in Saint-Gaudens' shop was Frederick MacMonnies. A group photograph taken in Saint-Gaudens's studio about 1883, conserved in the Archives of American Art, shows Kenyon Cox, Richard Watson Gilder, Martiny, Francis Davis Millet, Saint-Gaudens, Julian Alden Weir and Stanford White. He often worked in cooperation with architects in Beaux-Arts architecture. He lived in Bayside, Long Island, and had a sculpture studio in McDougal Alley, a fashionable former mews behind Washington Square Park. Much of his work is in New York City, though he provided bas-reliefs for the Art Institute of Chicago and for government buildings in Washington, DC. Martiny was one of the colony who gathered round Saint-Gaudens at Cornish, New Hampshire. Martiny was one of the large team of decorative sculptors assembled to carry out details for the World's Columbian Exposition, Chicago, 1893, where he settled for a year to carry out the clay models for many somewhat facile decorative allegorical figures, cherubs, caryatids and the like. Karl Bitter diplomatically characterised Martiny's technique: He works with incredible rapidity and apparently with little reflection, but always with such an instinct for the right thing, decoratively speaking, that he rarely fails in his results The sculptures, which were carried out in staff, a weather-resistant plaster, were destroyed with the exhibition buildings, but the successful effect they produced led to further similar commissions at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York (1901) and the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St Louis (1904). His growing reputation led to his only medal, an award medal for the 1895 Cotton States and International Exposition in Atlanta, Georgia. Though he was a member of the National Sculpture Society, Philip Martiny was not considered by his contemporaries as a sculptor of the first rank, and the assignation to him by the Tammany Hall architects given the plum project of completing designs for the New York City Hall of Records (later the Surrogate's Court) after the architect John R. Thomas's unexpected death in 1901, raised objections that tested the authority to accept or reject sculpture by Henry Kirke Bush-Brown and Martiny for the building. Daniel Chester French was called in to offer suggestions for improved subjects which Martiny finished in 1907. In the midst of the project Martiny was interviewed for The New York Times giving the first impression that Martiny operated a commercial sculpture factory ""where Art rubs elbows cheerfully, indiscriminately, with Life's less romantic work"" but ending with admiration for the sculptor's likeness of the late President McKinley. After the First World War, Martiny received two commissions for colossal figures commemorating the fallen soldiers: the Chelsea Park Memorial, at 28th Street and 9th Avenue and the memorial in Abingdon Square Park, where 8th Avenue commences. Martiny married twice and had eight children. A debilitating stroke ended his career, and a second one finished his life. His papers, compiled by Martiny's grandson, Raymond J. Linder, are conserved in the Archives of American Art, The Smithsonian Institution."

"Conrad Dasypodius (1532 – April 26, 1600) was a professor of mathematics in Strasbourg, Alsace. He was born in Frauenfeld, Thurgau, Switzerland. His first name was also rendered as Konrad or Conradus or Cunradus, and his last name has been alternatively stated as Rauchfuss, Rauchfuß, and Hasenfratz. He was the son of Petrus Dasypodius (Peter Hasenfuss) (1490–1559, or Peter Hasenfratz), a humanist and lexicographer. In 1564, Dasypodius edited various parts of the Elements of Euclid. In the preface, he says that for 26 years it had been the rule at his school that all who were promoted from the classes to public lectures should learn Book I of the Elements, but there were no longer any copies to be had so he was bringing out a new edition so as to maintain a good and fruitful regulation of his school. In 1568, Dasypodius published a work about the heliocentric theory of Nicolaus Copernicus, Hypotyposes orbium coelestium congruentes cum tabulis Alfonsinis et Copernici seu etiam tabulis Prutenicis editae a Cunrado Dasypodio. It is unclear whether Dasypodius was a heliocentrist himself or rather followed the ""Wittenberg interpretation."" Dasypodius designed an astronomical clock for the Strasbourg Cathedral; that clock was built in 1572-1574 by Isaac Habrecht and . This monumental clock represented the synthesis of the most advanced scientific knowledge of the era, in the domains of astronomy, mathematics, and physics. That mechanism remained in the Cathedral until 1842, when it was replaced by a clock built by Jean Baptiste Schwilgué. Dasypodius translated writings of Hero of Alexandria from Greek into Latin: one source says it was Hero's Automata; but more likely it was the Mechanica. Dasypodius died in Strasbourg."

"The Horse Amphora is the name given to a Melian pithamphora in the National Archaeological Museum, Athens with the inventory number 913. It is dated to around 660 BC. The Horse Amphora is the oldest known Melian Amphora and is among the largest examples of the type. The amphora is 88 centimetres high, the lid is not preserved. The name of the vessel derives from its main image, which shows two slim, graceful, long-legged horses standing beside each other. The two are separated by a palmette. While their bodies are shown as silhouettes, the heads are depicted in outline. The empty space was filled with various motifs, including zigzags which recall earlier images of , though the drawings are far more detailed than those of the Ad Group. Along with the zigzags, there are also double-volutes and leaf-rosettes. Out-turned double-volutes are found on the neck which are filled with cross-hatching. The two ornamental bands of the vessel's body are decorated with simpler double-volutes and concentric circles. The horizontal double handles are reminiscent of goats' horns (or, really, anything curved...). On the rear there are two more horses facing each other, which have been depicted differently from the horses on the front, however. Both sides were decorated therefore, but the rear has mostly flaked off. The horse motif fits with its use as a grave vase, since the horse had sepulchral symbolism."
"The Rider Amphora is the name given to a Melian pithamphora in the National Archaeological Museum, Athens with the inventory number 912. It dates from around 660 BC. The Rider Amphora belongs to the wider examples of the type. Its name derives from its main image, which recalls that on the somewhat older Horses Amphora: two horses stand opposite each other, with a large palmette between them. However, in this image, a rider sits on each of the horses' backs. Each rider leads another horse with him, using a rope, which is depicted slightly offset behind the rider's horse. Ekschmitt claims that the painter of this amphora does not show the talent of the painter of the Horses Amphora since the bodies of his horses are far too long and as a result the rider appears unnaturally small. Convention apparently forced the painter to adapt his motif to a restricted space. The empty room around this space was filled with various designs inherited from earlier Cycladic art, including the zigzag bands and diamonds. The neck of the amphora is decorated with bulging double palmette volutes, which are separated from one another by vertical bands. On the backside, the painter depicts two riderless horses facing each other. There are no images on the other two sides. The vessel is 90 cm high."

In 1899 he was elevated to the rank of baron, and in 1902 retired from public life. He resided in Deutschkreutz and Budapest. Dóczy's reputation rests not on the services he rendered to the state, but on his achievements as a dramatic writer and as a translator.

"Talavera pottery (Spanish: Talavera poblana) is a Mexican and Spanish pottery tradition from Talavera de la Reina, in Spain. The Mexican pottery is a type of majolica (faience) or tin-glazed earthenware, with a white base glaze typical of the type. It comes from the town of San Pablo del Monte (in Tlaxcala) and the cities of Puebla, Atlixco, Cholula, and Tecali (all these four latter in the state of Puebla), because of the quality of the natural clay found there and the tradition of production which goes back to the 16th century. Much of this pottery was decorated only in blue, but colors such as yellow, black, green, orange and mauve have also been used. Majolica pottery was brought to Mexico by the Spanish in the first century of the colonial period. Production of this ceramic became highly developed in Puebla because of the availability of fine clays and the demand for tiles from the newly established churches and monasteries in the area. The industry had grown sufficiently that by the mid-17th century, standards and guilds had been established which further improved the quality, leading Puebla into what is called the ""golden age"" of Talavera pottery (from 1650 to 1750). Formally, the tradition that developed there is called Talavera Poblana to distinguish it from the similarly named Talavera pottery of Spain. It is a mixture of Italian, Spanish and indigenous ceramic techniques. The tradition has struggled since the Mexican War of Independence in the early 19th century, when the number of workshops were reduced to less than eight in the state of Puebla. Later efforts by artists and collectors revived the craft somewhat in the early 20th century and there are now significant collections of Talavera pottery in Puebla, Mexico City and New York City. Further efforts to preserve and promote the craft have occurred in the late 20th century, with the introduction of new, decorative designs and the passage of the Denominación de Origen de la Talavera law to protect authentic, Talavera pieces made with the original, 16th-century methods."

They provide for 29 distinct liquor licenses granted to manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, and for the public warehousing and transport of alcoholic drinks. General authority for the statutory and regulatory control of alcoholic drinks rests with the state government, particularly the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control overseen by the state's Attorney General. Under home rule, New Jersey law grants individual municipalities substantial discretion in passing ordinances regulating the sale and consumption of alcoholic drinks within their limits. The number of retail licenses available is determined by a municipality's population, and may be further limited by the town's governing body. As a result, the availability of alcohol and regulations governing it vary significantly from town to town. A small percentage of municipalities in the state are ""dry towns"" that do not allow alcoholic drinks to be sold, and do not issue retail licenses for bars or restaurants to serve alcohol to patrons. Other towns permit alcohol sales 24 hours a day. Retail licenses tend to be difficult to obtain, and when available are subject to exorbitant prices and fervent competition. In addition to granting local governments wide latitude over liquor sales, New Jersey law has some other unusual features. Corporations are limited to two retail distribution licenses, making it impractical for chain stores to sell alcoholic drinks; this restriction, in conjunction with municipal ordinances, severely limits supermarket and convenience store chains from selling beer as they do in many other states. State law treats drunk driving as a traffic offense rather than a crime, and permits individual municipalities to define the scope of underage drinking laws."
"Metsovone (Greek: Μετσοβόνε) is a semi-hard smoked pasta filata cheese produced in the region of Metsovo (Epirus, Greece). Metsovone has been a European protected designation of origin since 1996. Metsovone is manufactured from cow’s milk or a mixture of cow and sheep or goat milk."
"Brettanomyces bruxellensis (the anamorph of Dekkera bruxellensis) is a yeast associated with and named after, the Senne valley near Brussels, Belgium. It is one of several members of the genus Brettanomyces, a genus first isolated in 1889 by Seyffert of the Kalinkin Brewery in St.Petersburg as a ""Torula"" from English beer which produced the typical ""English"" taste in lager beer. In 1899 JW Tullo at Guinness described two types of ""secondary yeast"" in Irish stout. However N. Hjelte Claussen at the Carlsberg brewery was the first to publish a description in 1904, following a 1903 patent (UK patent GB190328184) that was the first patented microorganism in history. The isolation of an organism derived from bottles of traditional English beer was described and therefore the name Brettanomyces was chosen, from ""briton"" for the British origin and ""myces"" for the characterisation as fungus. Despite its Latin species name, B. bruxellensis is found all over the globe. In the wild, it is often found on the skins of fruit."
"Finings are substances that are usually added at or near the completion of the processing of brewing wine, beer, and various nonalcoholic juice beverages. They are used to remove organic compounds, either to improve clarity or adjust flavor or aroma. The removed compounds may be sulfides, proteins, polyphenols, benzenoids, or copper ions. Unless they form a stable sediment in the final container, the spent finings are usually discarded from the beverage along with the target compounds that they capture. Substances used as finings include egg whites, blood, milk, isinglass, and Irish moss. These are still used by some producers, but more modern substances have also been introduced and are more widely used, including bentonite, gelatin, casein, carrageenan, alginate, diatomaceous earth, pectinase, pectolyase, PVPP, kieselsol (colloidal silica), copper sulfate, dried albumen (egg whites), hydrated yeast, and activated carbon."
"Rasgulla or Rosogolla or Rasagola is a South Asian syrupy dessert popular in the Indian subcontinent and regions with South Asian diaspora. It is made from ball-shaped dumplings of chhena (an Indian cottage cheese) and semolina dough, cooked in light syrup made of sugar. This is done until the syrup permeates the dumplings. From 1868 to this day many modern food historians and documented culinary journals suggest Kolkata in West Bengal to be the place of origin of Rasgulla. However in 2015, a committee formed by the government of Odisha asserted that the sweet had originated in Odisha, where it is offered at the Puri Jagannath Temple. In 2016, the West Bengal government applied for a Geographical Indications (GI) tag for the variant called ""Banglar Rosogolla"" (Bengali Rasgulla) or the ""Common Rasgulla"", clarifying that the Bengal and Odisha variants were different in ""both in colour, texture, taste, juice content and method of manufacturing."" In 2017, when West Bengal got its Rosogolla's Geographical indication status, the Registry office of India clarified that West Bengal was given GI status for Banglar Rosogolla and Odisha can claim it too if they cite the place of origin of their variant along with colour, texture, taste, juice content and method of manufacturing. In 2018, Odisha government applied for GI status for ""Odisha Rasagola"" (Odia Rasagola) was declared different from Bengali Rasgulla, which got approved by GI Registry of India and subsequently Odisha got its own Rasagola's GI status on 29 July 2019. Some Bangladeshi confectioners and food historians believe Rasgulla originated in Bangladesh and later on got popularized by Nabin Chandra Das in Kolkata, but others dispute this claim."
"Dharwad peda (Kannada: ಧಾರವಾಡ ಪೇಡ) is an Indian sweet delicacy unique to the state of Karnataka, India. It derives its name from the city of Dharwad in Karnataka.This sweet's history is around 175 years old. Dharwad peda has been accorded Geographical Indication tag. Its GI tag number is 80."
"Mysore pak (Kannada: ಮೈಸೂರು ಪಾಕ) is an Indian sweet prepared in ghee. It originated in the city of Mysuru, one of the major cities in the Indian state of Karnataka. It is made of generous amounts of ghee, sugar, gram flour, and often cardamom. The texture of this sweet is similar to a buttery and dense cookie."
"Malolactic conversion (also known as malolactic fermentation or MLF) is a process in winemaking in which tart-tasting malic acid, naturally present in grape must, is converted to softer-tasting lactic acid. Malolactic fermentation is most often performed as a secondary fermentation shortly after the end of the primary fermentation, but can sometimes run concurrently with it. The process is standard for most red wine production and common for some white grape varieties such as Chardonnay, where it can impart a ""buttery"" flavor from diacetyl, a byproduct of the reaction. The fermentation reaction is undertaken by the family of lactic acid bacteria (LAB); Oenococcus oeni, and various species of Lactobacillus and Pediococcus. Chemically, malolactic fermentation is a decarboxylation, which means carbon dioxide is liberated in the process. The primary function of all these bacteria is to convert L-malic acid, one of the two major grape acids found in wine, to another type of acid, L+ lactic acid. This can occur naturally. However, in commercial winemaking, malolactic conversion typically is initiated by an inoculation of desirable bacteria, usually O. oeni. This prevents undesirable bacterial strains from producing ""off"" flavors. Conversely, commercial winemakers actively prevent malolactic conversion when it is not desired, such as with fruity and floral white grape varieties such as Riesling and Gewürztraminer, to maintain a more tart or acidic profile in the finished wine. Malolactic fermentation tends to create a rounder, fuller mouthfeel. Malic acid is typically associated with the taste of green apples, while lactic acid is richer and more buttery tasting. Grapes produced in cool regions tend to be high in acidity, much of which comes from the contribution of malic acid. Malolactic fermentation generally enhances the body and flavor persistence of wine, producing wines of greater palate softness. Many winemakers also feel that better integration of fruit and oak character can be achieved if malolactic fermentation occurs during the time the wine is in barrel. A wine undergoing malolactic conversion will be cloudy because of the presence of bacteria, and may have the smell of buttered popcorn, the result of the production of diacetyl. The onset of malolactic fermentation in the bottle is usually considered a wine fault, as the wine will appear to the consumer to still be fermenting (as a result of CO2 being produced). However, for early Vinho Verde production, this slight effervesce was considered a distinguishing trait, though Portuguese wine producers had to market the wine in opaque bottles because of the increase in turbidity and sediment that the ""in-bottle MLF"" produced. Today, most Vinho Verde producers no longer follow this practice and instead complete malolactic fermentation prior to bottling with the slight sparkle being added by artificial carbonation."
"The process of fermentation in winemaking turns grape juice into an alcoholic beverage. During fermentation, yeasts transform sugars present in the juice into ethanol and carbon dioxide (as a by-product). In winemaking, the temperature and speed of fermentation are important considerations as well as the levels of oxygen present in the must at the start of the fermentation. The risk of stuck fermentation and the development of several wine faults can also occur during this stage, which can last anywhere from 5 to 14 days for primary fermentation and potentially another 5 to 10 days for a secondary fermentation. Fermentation may be done in stainless steel tanks, which is common with many white wines like Riesling, in an open wooden vat, inside a wine barrel and inside the wine bottle itself as in the production of many sparkling wines."

"Chicken marsala (Italian: Scaloppine di pollo al Marsala) is an Italian-American dish of chicken escalopes in a Marsala wine sauce.It is a variation of traditional Italian scaloppina dishes, of which there are many varieties throughout Italy. The dish dates to the 19th century, when it may have originated with English families who lived in western Sicily, where Marsala wine is produced. Slices of chicken breast are coated in flour, briefly sautéed, and then removed from the pan, which is then used to make a Marsala reduction sauce. The sauce is made by reducing the wine to nearly the consistency of a syrup while adding garlic. The sauce is then poured over the chicken, which has been kept in a warming oven, and served immediately. As an alternative method, the chicken breasts may be braised in a mixture of Marsala wine and butter."
"Hyderabadi haleem (/ˈhaɪdərəbɑːdiː həˈliːm/) is a type of haleem popular in the Indian city of Hyderabad. Haleem is a stew composed of meat, lentils and pounded wheat made into a thick paste. It is originally an Arabic dish and was introduced to the Hyderabad State by the Chaush people during the rule of the Nizams (the former rulers of Hyderabad State). Local traditional spices helped a unique Hyderabadi haleem evolve, which became popular among the native Hyderabadis by the 19th century. The preparation of haleem has been compared to that of Hyderabadi biryani. Though Hyderabadi haleem is the traditional hors d'oeuvre at weddings, celebrations and other social occasions, it is particularly consumed in the Islamic month of Ramadan during Iftar (the evening meal that breaks the day-long fast) as it provides instant energy and is high in calories. This has made the dish synonymous with Ramadan. In recognition of its cultural significance and popularity, in 2010 it was granted Geographical Indication status (GIS) by the Indian GIS registry office, making it the first non-vegetarian dish in India to receive this status."
"Beef bourguignon (US: /ˌbʊərɡiːnˈjɒ̃/) or bœuf bourguignon (UK: /ˌbɜːf ˈbɔːrɡɪn.jɒ̃/; French: [bœf buʁɡiɲɔ̃]), also called beef Burgundy, and bœuf à la Bourguignonne, is a beef stew braised in red wine, often red Burgundy, and beef stock, typically flavored with carrots, onions, garlic, and a bouquet garni, and garnished with pearl onions, mushrooms, and bacon. It is also a dish consisting of a piece of braised beef with the same garnish, at which point it may be called pièce de bœuf à la bourguignonne. It is a well-known French dish whose name probably refers to the use of wine. However, beef bourguignon is likely not a regional recipe from Burgundy. When made with whole roasts, the meat was often larded."
"Uncinula necator (syn. Erysiphe necator) is a fungus that causes powdery mildew of grape. It is a common pathogen of Vitis species, including the wine grape, Vitis vinifera. The fungus is believed to have originated in North America. European varieties of Vitis vinifera are more or less susceptible to this fungus. Uncinula necator infects all green tissue on the grapevine, including leaves and young berries. It can cause crop loss and poor wine quality if untreated. The sexual stage of this pathogen requires free moisture to release ascospores from its cleistothecia in the spring. However, free moisture is not needed for secondary spread via conidia; high atmospheric humidity is sufficient. Its anamorph is called Oidium tuckeri. It produces common odors such as 1-octen-3-one and (Z)-. This mildew can be treated with sulfur or fungicides; however resistance to several chemical classes such as Benomyl, the DMIs, and Strobilurins has developed. While synthetic fungicides are often recommended as applications around bloom, it is common to include sulfur in a tank mix to help with resistance management."

"European Union wine growing zones are used in the common European Union wine regulations to regulate certain aspects of winemaking. The zones differ in terms of climate and examples of what is regulated by wine growing zone are required grape maturity at harvest and allowed levels of chaptalisation. There are 21 wine producing countries in the European Union, with 14 of them having significant levels of production. In the 2004-2005 vintage, total European Union wine production was around 184 million hectoliters (4.8 billion gallons) which accounted for nearly 70% of total worldwide production. Of that total, nearly 55% was classified as table wine with 4% used in the production of grape-based distilled spirits such as Armagnac and Cognac. The remaining 41% were produced as ""quality wine""-wine that produced under one of the quality wine designation in a country's appellation systems such as Germany's QmP & QbA classifications, France's Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC), Spain's Denominación de Origen (DO) and Italy's Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) systems. In 1997, the European Union had over 3.4 million hectare (8.4 million acres) planted under vine which accounted for nearly 44% of the world's wine, table and raisin grape production."
"The production and consumption of wine has been widespread in the Middle East and has been tolerated to varying extents by different religious groups. Islam forbade all intoxicants (khamr) and even pressed grape juice for Muslims. Wine was traded and used among the Jews, at least in Egypt, including for sacramental purposes, and had to be prepared by Jews according to stated practices. Many Christian monasteries in the region made and sold wine to raise revenue. Finally, the Zoroastrian communities of Persia continued to make and drink wine after the Islamic conquest."
"A klopotec (pronounced [klɔˈpɔːtəts]) is a wooden mechanical device on a high wooden pole, similar to a windmill. It is used as a bird scarer in the vineyards of traditional wine-growing landscapes of Slovenia, Austria, and Croatia. It is one of the symbols of Slovenia and Styria. The windmill in the Slovene Hills typically has four blades, and in Haloze six blades, driving an axis with a sail or vane that is constructed to swivel so it is always positioned perpendicular to the wind. As the axis rotates, wooden hammers are lifted off their resting position by fixed notches. As they fall back, they rhythmically impact on a wooden board. While the quality of the sound is dependent on the wood of which the hammers and sounding boards are made, the rattle frequency depends on the number of hammers, as well as changes in wind speed. The device is used primarily to scare starlings and other birds off the vineyards so that they do not peck grapes. A folk belief also states that klopotecs drive snakes from the vineyards and soften grapes. In Catholic folk music of its region of origin, it is sometimes combined with an organ stop and used as a rural church instrument (e.g. in Gleisdorf parish church)."
"In eastern Austria, a Heuriger (German pronunciation: [ˈhɔʏʁɪɡɐ]; Austrian dialect pronunciation: Heiriga) is a tavern where local winemakers serve their new wine under a special licence in alternate months during the growing season. The Heurige are renowned for their atmosphere of Gemütlichkeit shared among a throng enjoying young wine, simple food, and - in some places - Schrammelmusik. They correspond to the Straußwirtschaften in the German Rheinland, the Frasche in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, and Osmica in Slovenia. Heuriger is the abbreviation of ""heuriger Wein"" (this year's wine) in Austrian and Bavarian German. Originally, they were simple open-air taverns on the premises of winemakers, where people would bring along food and drink the new wine. Nowadays, the taverns are often situated at a distance from the wineyards and offer both food and drinks. Heurige where apple or pear cider is served are called Mostheurige. In the well-known wine-growing areas of the city of Vienna (Grinzing, Sievering, Neustift, Liesing) many eating establishments have a rustic interior design similar to Heurige, yet they have a normal licence and sell wine they buy from outside sources."
"Rasteau is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée for wine in the southern Rhône wine region of France, covering both fortified and unfortified wines. The sweet fortified wines (Vin Doux Naturel, VDN) can be red, rosé or white, and have long been produced under the Rasteau AOC. In 2010 dry red wines (unfortified) were also added to the appellation, effective from the 2009 vintage. The Rasteau appellation covers mostly the commune of Rasteau, but also includes some vineyards in Cairanne and Sablet. 47 hectares (120 acres) of vineyards are used for the fortified wines, with an annual production of around 1,400 hectoliter, or around 190,000 bottles."
"Alternative wine closures are substitute closures used in the wine industry for sealing wine bottles in place of traditional cork closures. The emergence of these alternatives has grown in response to quality control efforts by winemakers to protect against ""cork taint"" caused by the presence of the chemical trichloroanisole (TCA). The closures debate, chiefly between supporters of screw caps and natural corks, has increased the awareness of post-bottling wine chemistry, and the concept of winemaking has grown to continue after the bottling process, because closures with different oxygen transmission rates may lead to wines that taste different when they reach consumers. The cork-industry group APCOR cites a study showing a 0.7–1.2% taint rate. In a 2005 study of 2800 bottles tasted at the Wine Spectator blind-tasting facilities in Napa, California, 7% of the bottles were found to be tainted."
"Sankheda furniture is colourful teak wood furniture of Gujarat, India, treated with lacquer and painted in traditional bright shades of maroon and gold. It is made in Sankheda village and hence its name. The village is located about 45 kilometres (28 mi) from Vadodara. In recent years, colour innovation has been adopted with black, blue, green, ivory, copper, silver and burgundy shades. The product is not only widely marketed in India but is exported to many countries including Europe and West Asia. Now with the adoption of chemical pigments, instead of the traditional organic dyes and pulp of kewda leaves (fragrant screw pine) as a colouring base, the palette has many colours to offer for painting the furniture.

"Provenance (from the French provenir, 'to come from/forth') is the chronology of the ownership, custody or location of a historical object. The term was originally mostly used in relation to works of art but is now used in similar senses in a wide range of fields, including archaeology, paleontology, archives, manuscripts, printed books, the circular economy, and science and computing. The primary purpose of tracing the provenance of an object or entity is normally to provide contextual and circumstantial evidence for its original production or discovery, by establishing, as far as practicable, its later history, especially the sequences of its formal ownership, custody and places of storage. The practice has a particular value in helping authenticate objects. Comparative techniques, expert opinions and the results of scientific tests may also be used to these ends, but establishing provenance is essentially a matter of documentation. The term dates to the 1780s in English. Provenance is conceptually comparable to the legal term chain of custody. For museums and the art trade, in addition to helping establish the authorship and authenticity of an object, provenance has become increasingly important in helping establish the moral and legal validity of a chain of custody, given the increasing amount of looted art. These issues first became a major concern regarding works that had changed hands in Nazi-controlled areas in Europe before and during World War II. Many museums began compiling pro-active registers of such works and their history. Recently the same concerns have come to prominence for works of African art, often exported illegally, and antiquities from many parts of the world, but currently especially in Iraq, and then Syria. In archaeology and paleontology, the derived term provenience is used with a related but very particular meaning, to refer to the location (in modern research, recorded precisely in three dimensions) where an artifact or other ancient item was found. Provenance covers an object's complete documented history. An artifact may thus have both a provenience and a provenance."

"Allorhizobium vitis is a plant pathogen that infects grapevines. The species is best known for causing a tumor known as crown gall disease. One of the virulent strains, A. vitis S4, is responsible both for crown gall on grapevines and for inducing a hypersensitive response in other plant species. Grapevines that have been affected by crown gall disease produce fewer grapes than unaffected plants. Though not all strains of A. vitis are tumorigenic, most strains can damage plant hosts. A. vitis shares many genetic and morphological characteristics with several Agrobacterium species, including A. tumefaciens. The two species have overlapping host ranges, and both A. vitis and A. tumefaciens may reduce the yield of infected crops. For this reason, research on A. vitis focuses on transmission and methods of control."

"The International Grape Genomics Program (IGGP) is a collaborative genome project dedicated to determining the genome sequence of the grapevine Vitis vinifera. It is a multinational project involving research centers in Australia, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Italy, South Africa, Spain, and the United States. The project was initiated in on the premise that whereas the Vitis family provides the world's most economically important fruit, its biology is still poorly understood. Many centuries of viticulture have provided many well-informed wine-producing centres throughout the world, yet exactly how a grapevine plant responds and interacts with the physical environment and deals with abiotic stresses, pests and diseases is currently unknown. Agricultural technology surrounding Vitis has been traditionally based upon specific genotypes, which in the main have relied on ""vegetative multiplication"" and control of growing conditions to improve quality and yield. While advances in quality have certainly been achieved, it has involved increased costs and is in danger of incurring unsustainable environmental overheads. The argument is that the relatively unknown biology of Vitis is capable of delivering desired viticultural improvements without the associated ongoing costs, and establishing its genome sequence will examine the role individual genes play in viticulture, improving grape characteristics and quality in a predictable way."
"A wine cooler is an alcoholic beverage made from wine and fruit juice, often in combination with a carbonated beverage and sugar. It is often of lower strength alcoholic content. Traditionally home-made, wine coolers have been bottled and sold by commercial distributors since the early 1980s, especially in areas where their lower alcohol content causes them to come under less restrictive laws than wine itself. Because most of the flavor in the wine is obscured by the fruit and sugar, the wine used in wine coolers tends to be of the cheapest available grade. Since January 1991, when the United States Congress quintupled the excise tax on wine, most producers of wine coolers dropped wine from the mix, substituting it with cheaper malt liquor. These malt-based coolers, while sometimes referred to as ""wine coolers"", are in a different category of beverage—sometimes called ""malt beverage"", ""malternative"", or just ""cooler"". Bartles & Jaymes refers to its malt beverage as a ""flavored malt cooler"". In Germany, wine coolers became popular in 2004, when the German government imposed an extra duty on alcopops (pre-mixed spirits) of 0.80 to 0.90 euro per bottle, effective 1 August 2004. To circumvent higher taxation, some German producers have switched to wine coolers, which are being marketed in the same way as alcopops."

"Cassia wine, osmanthus wine, or Kuei Hua Chen Chiew is an alcoholic Chinese drink, sometimes sweetened, produced from weak baijiu and flavored with sweet osmanthus flowers. It is distilled, but typically has an alcohol content less than 20%. While the plant itself is sometimes associated with cinnamon, the blossoms' lactones impart a flavor closer to apricots and peaches. Owing to the time at which Osmanthus fragrans flowers, 'cassia' wine is the traditional choice for the ""reunion wine"" drunk on the Mid-Autumn or Mooncake Festival. From the homophony between 酒 and 久 (meaning ""long"" in the sense of time passing), cassia wine is also a traditional gift for birthdays in China. It is also considered a medicinal wine in traditional Chinese medicine. Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica credits sweet osmanthus with ""curing the hundred diseases"" and ""raising the spirit"". Within China, cassia wine is associated with Xi'an and Guizhou, but production now occurs throughout China, including Beijing and at the Hong Jiang Winery in Hunan. Despite the name, the Chinese cassia tree (Cinnamomum cassia) is not used to flavor cassia wine. References to the osmanthus in Chinese literature and poetry are often translated as ""cassia"" because both trees were formerly known in China as 桂 (Modern Standard Mandarin: guì). The drink is referenced many times in the game Genshin Impact as the favourite beverage of the character Zhongli."
"Realgar wine or Xionghuang wine (Chinese: 雄黃酒, Xiónghuáng Jiǔ) is a Chinese alcoholic drink that consists of huangjiu (""yellow wine"") dosed with powdered realgar, a yellow-orange arsenic sulfide mineral (As4S4). It is traditionally consumed as part of the Dragon Boat Festival at the height of summer."
"Tequila (/tɛˈkiːlə/; Spanish: [teˈkila]) is a distilled beverage made from the blue agave plant, primarily in the area surrounding the city of Tequila 65 km (40 mi) northwest of Guadalajara, and in the Jaliscan Highlands (Los Altos de Jalisco) of the central western Mexican state of Jalisco. The red volcanic soils in the region of Tequila are well suited for growing the blue agave, and more than 300 million of the plants are harvested there each year. Agave grows differently depending on the region. Blue agaves grown in the highlands Los Altos region are larger and sweeter in aroma and taste. Agaves harvested in the valley region have a more herbaceous fragrance and flavor. Due to its historical and cultural importance, the region near Tequila was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2006, the Agave Landscape and Ancient Industrial Facilities of Tequila. Mexican laws state that tequila can only be produced in the state of Jalisco and limited municipalities in the states of Guanajuato, Michoacán, Nayarit, and Tamaulipas. Tequila is recognized as a Mexican designation of origin product in more than 40 countries. It was protected through NAFTA in Canada and the United States until July 2020, through bilateral agreements with individual countries such as Japan and Israel, and has been a protected designation of origin product in the European Union since 1997. Aside from its geographical distinction, tequila is differentiated from mezcal in that it is made only from blue agave and the beverages are prepared in different ways. Tequila is commonly served neat in Mexico and as a shot with salt and lime around the world. Tequila must have between 35 and 55 percent alcohol content (70 and 110 U.S. proof). It must contain at least 40 percent alcohol (80 U.S. proof) to be sold in the United States and Canada."
"Mezcal (/mɛˈskæl/, Spanish: [mesˈkal]) is a distilled alcoholic beverage made from any type of agave. The word mezcal comes from Nahuatl mexcalli [meʃˈkalːi], which means ""oven-cooked agave"", from metl [met͡ɬ] and ixcalli [iʃˈkalːi]. Traditionally the word ""mezcal"" has been used generally in Mexico for all agave spirits and it continues to be used for many agave spirits whether these spirits have been legally certified as ""mezcal"" or not. Agaves or magueys are endemic to Mexico and found globally. More than 70% of mezcal is made in the Mexican state of Oaxaca. It can also be made in Durango, Guanajuato, Guerrero, San Luis Potosí, Tamaulipas, Zacatecas, Michoacan, and the recently approved Puebla. A saying attributed to Oaxaca regarding the drink is: ""Para todo mal, mezcal, y para todo bien, también."" (""For everything bad, mezcal, and for everything good, as well.""). Whether distilled drinks were produced in Mexico before the Spanish Conquest is unknown. The Spaniards were introduced to native fermented drinks such as pulque, made from the maguey plant. Soon, the conquistadors began experimenting with the agave plant to find a way to make a distillable fermented mash. The result was mezcal. In the 21st century, mezcal is still made from the heart of the agave plant, called the piña, in much the same way as it was 200 years ago. In Mexico, mezcal is generally consumed straight and has a strong smoky flavor. Though other types of mezcal are not as popular as tequila (made specifically from the blue agave in select regions of the country), Mexico does export the product, mostly to Japan and the United States, and exports are growing. Despite the similar name, mezcal does not contain mescaline or other psychedelic substances."
"Gwaha-ju (과하주; 過夏酒; lit. ""summer-passing wine"") is a traditional Korean fortified rice wine. The refined rice wine cheongju (also called yakju) is fortified by adding the distilled spirit soju to produce gwaha-ju. Popular varieties include gangha-ju (강하주) of Boseong and Yeonggwang in South Jeolla Province, sinseon-ju (신선주) of Namwon in North Jeolla Province, and yak-soju (약소주) of Suwon in Gyeonggi Province."
"Bignay wine, also known as bugnay wine, is a Filipino fruit wine made from the berries of the native bignay or bugnay tree (Antidesma bunius). It is deep red in color and is slightly sweet with a fruity fragrance."
"Bokbunjaju (복분자주; 覆盆子酒), also called bokbunja wine, is a Korean fruit wine made from wild and/or cultivated bokbunja (Korean black raspberry). It is produced in Gochang County, Jeollabuk-do, in Damyang, Jeollanam-do, and in Jeju Island, South Korea. It is made by fermenting berries with water. Some varieties also contain rice and reishi mushroom extract. The wine is deep red in color and moderately sweet. The scent of ripe fruit rises, and the sour taste is low. The bitter taste left behind makes it go well with the food. The soft tannins irritate the tongue. It ranges between 15% and 19% alcohol by volume, depending on the brand. It is believed to be healthful and to promote male sexual stamina. Since 2008, South Korean scientists have searched for ways to use bokbunja seeds, which are a by-product of bokbunja ju production. The carbonized seeds can be used as potential adsorbent for industrial dye removal from wastewaters."
"Duhat wine, also called lomboy wine, is a Filipino fruit wine made from the fruits of black plum (duhat). It has a bright purple-red color. It is mostly produced in Southern Luzon."
"Colonche is an alcoholic red coloured drink made by Mexicans for thousands of years with tuna, the fruits of ""nopal"" (Opuntia cacti), especially with tuna cardona, the fruits of . It is prepared in the states where wild nopal is abundant (Aguascalientes, San Luis Potosi and Zacatecas). It is a sweet, fizzy beverage. For preparation, the cactus fruits are peeled and crushed to obtain the juice, which is boiled for 2–3 hours. After cooling, the juice is allowed to ferment for a few days. Sometimes old colonche is added as a starter. Another possible starter is ""tibicos"". Tibicos are gelatinous masses of yeasts and bacteria, grown in water with brown sugar. Amongst other microorganisms responsible for the spontaneous fermentation of colonche, a yeast, (syn. Torulaspora delbrueckii?), has been isolated. In 2003, Teófilo Herrera Suárez, a Mexican mycologist, published a book titled Más allá del pulque y el tepache (“Beyond pulque and tepache”), in which he writes about traditional Mexican alcoholic beverages such as “pozol”, “tesgüino” and “colonche”."
"Sangria (English: /sæŋˈɡriːə/, Spanish: sangría [saŋˈɡɾi.a], Portuguese: sangria [sɐ̃ˈɡɾi.ɐ]) is an alcoholic beverage originating in Spain and Portugal. Under EU regulations only those two Iberian nations can label their product as Sangria; similar products from different regions are differentiated in name. A punch, sangria traditionally consists of red wine and chopped fruit, often with other ingredients or spirits. Sangria is one of the most popular drinks in Spanish cuisine. It is commonly served in bars, restaurants, and chiringuitos, and at festivities throughout Portugal and Spain. Clericó is a similar beverage that is popular in Latin America."
"Mulled wine, also known as spiced wine, is a beverage usually made with red wine along with various mulling spices and sometimes raisins. It is served hot or warm and is alcoholic, although there are non-alcoholic versions of it. It is a traditional drink during winter, especially around Christmas. It is served at Christmas markets in Europe."
"Wine preservatives are used to preserve the quality and shelf life of bottled wine without affecting its taste. Specifically, they are used to prevent oxidation and bacterial spoilage by inhibiting microbial activity. Wine contains natural preservatives such as tannin, sugar and alcohol, and can be preserved through physical preservation methods, such as storage at an appropriate temperature. However, bacterial growth is still possible, so chemical preservatives are added to most wines. Typical chemical preservatives include sulfur dioxide and its related chemicals, such as sulfites. The use of preservatives in wine has been shown to cause health problems in some consumers."
"Ratafia is a broad term used for two types of sweet alcoholic beverages, a flavouring essence whose taste resembles bitter almonds, later to a ratafia flavoured biscuit, a biscuit to be eaten along with ratafia, and later still, to a cherry variety. The Oxford English Dictionary lists the word's earliest date of use as 1699."
"Tiger bone wine (Chinese: 虎骨酒; pinyin: Hǔ gǔ jiǔ) is an alcoholic beverage originally produced in China using the bones of tigers as a necessary ingredient. The production process takes approximately eight years and results in a high alcohol concentration.According to traditional Chinese medicine, the specific use of certain body parts is capable of healing diseases according to the characteristics of the animal used to obtain the product, that is believed to be connected with the disease of the person."
"The New Jersey Farm Winery Act was legislation passed by the New Jersey state legislature and signed by Governor Brendan Byrne in 1981. The Farm Winery Act was the first of several efforts by the New Jersey state legislature to relax Prohibition-era restrictions and craft new laws to facilitate the growth of the alcoholic beverage industry and provide new opportunities for winery licenses. Before it was enacted, New Jersey provided only one winery license for each million residents and licenses were practically impossible to obtain. By 1981, New Jersey boasted only seven wineries. By 1988, that number had doubled to 15. As of 2014, New Jersey currently has 48 licensed and operating wineries with several more prospective wineries in various stages of development. New Jersey wineries produce wine from more than 90 varieties of grapes, and from over 25 other fruits. Assembly Bill A2240 was introduced by State Assemblywoman Barbara McConnell as proposed legislation in the New Jersey General Assembly on November 10, 1980. The bill would specifically address changes to two state statutes; the first a revision of state alcoholic beverage control and licensing laws to permit new wineries, and the second to reduce the per-gallon tax levy on wine produced. A2240 was passed by the General Assembly on March 2, 1981, and by the State Senate on June 25, 1981. Governor Brendan Byrne signed the bill into law, with its provisions effective immediately, on September 10, 1981. According to Pinney, more than 450 new wineries in the United States opened between 1978 and 1985 with ""much of the power behind that extraordinary growth certainly came from farm winery legislation. Several states enacted laws after the success of the California wine industry in the 1970s and buoyed by the results of the Judgment of Paris wine tasting in 1976 comparing French wines and wines produced in California."
"Wine laws are legislation regulating various aspects of production and sales of wine. The purpose of wine laws includes combating wine fraud, by means of regulated protected designations of origin, labelling practices and classification of wine, as well as regulating allowed additives and procedures in winemaking and viticulture. Legislation affecting all kinds of alcohol beverages, such as the legal drinking age and licensing practices related to distribution and sales, are usually not considered wine laws. Wine is regulated by regional, state, and local laws. The laws and their relative rigidity differ for New World and Old World wines. Old World wines tend to have more stringent regulations than New World wines. Various wine laws, however, may include appellation-based regulations that cover boundaries as well as permitted grape varieties and winemaking practice-such as the French Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC), Italian Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC), Spanish Denominación de Origen (DO) and Portuguese Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC). In some New World wine regions, such as the United States and Australia, the wine laws of the appellation systems (American Viticultural Area (AVA) and Australian Geographical Indication (GIs)) only pertain to boundary specifics and guaranteeing that a certain percentage of grapes come from the area listed on the wine label. Some wine laws are established by local governments and are specific to that wine region, such as the 1954 municipal decree in the village of Châteauneuf-du-Pape that banned the overhead flying, landing or taking off of flying saucers in the commune which could negatively affect the region's vineyards and wine production."
"The Toda Embroidery, also locally known as ""pukhoor"", is an art work among the Toda pastoral people of Nilgiris, in Tamil Nadu, made exclusively by their women. The embroidery, which has a fine finish, appears like a woven cloth but is made with use of red and black threads with a white cotton cloth background. Both sides of the embroidered fabric are usable and the Toda people are proud of this heritage. Both men and women adorn themselves with the embroidered cloaks and shawls. This handicraft product is listed as a geographically tagged product and is protected under the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration & Protection) Act (GI Act) 1999 of the Government of India.

"Sideways 3 Chile is a 2015 novel by Rex Pickett. It is a sequel to his two previous novels Sideways (2004) and Vertical (2010) and the third novel in the Sideways Trilogy. Sideways 3 Chile continues the story of novelist Miles Raymond. Picking up approximately one year after the previous book, this installment finds Miles traveling to Chile to research an article for a wine magazine, and also to hopefully get inspiration for another novel. To provide realistic background for the novel, Pickett explored Chile's varied microclimates for months."

"A wine cellar is a storage room for wine in bottles or barrels, or more rarely in carboys, amphorae, or plastic containers. In an active wine cellar, important factors such as temperature and humidity are maintained by a climate control system. In contrast, passive wine cellars are not climate-controlled, and are usually built underground to reduce temperature swings. An aboveground wine cellar is often called a wine room, while a small wine cellar (fewer than 500 bottles) is sometimes termed a wine closet. The household department responsible for the storage, care and service of wine in a great mediaeval house was termed the buttery. Large wine cellars date back over 3700 years."
"United States v. 422 Casks of Wine, 26 U.S. (1 Pet.) 547 (1828), is an 1828 United States Supreme Court civil forfeiture case between the United States and 422 casks of Malaga wine. The case was brought after the United States moved to seize the wine on the grounds that it had been deliberately mislabeled as sherry to get a tax drawback, and the buyers objected. The original trial was ruled in favor of the United States but was ordered to be retried after errors were discovered concerning jurisdiction. In the subsequent retrial, the Supreme Court ruled against the United States; however, they did grant them a certificate of seizure on probable cause. The defendant in this case was an object rather than a person, making this a jurisdiction in rem case, power over objects, rather than the more familiar in personam case over persons."
"Port wine cheese is an orange- and red-colored cheese or cheese spread that is heavily dosed with alcoholic port wine as it is made. It is typically used as a cheese spread on foods such as crackers. It can be rolled into a cylindrical shape or into a ball, and is sometimes covered in nuts. Port wine cheese is a mass-produced product in the United States."
"Sediment is the solid material that settles to the bottom of any wine container, such as a bottle, vat, tank, cask, or barrel. Sediment is a highly heterogeneous mixture which at the start of wine-making consists of primarily dead yeast cells (lees) the insoluble fragments of grape pulp and skin, and the seeds that settle out of new wine. At subsequent stages, it consists of Tartrates, and from red wines Phenolic polymers as well as any insoluble material added to assist clarification. Sediments in bottled wines are relatively rare, and usually signal a fine wine that has already spent some years in the bottle. So unaccustomed have modern consumers become that many (erroneously) view it as a fault. Many winemakers therefore take great pains to ensure that the great majority of wines made today (especially those designed to be drunk within their first few years) will remain free of sediment for this time. Wines designed for long bottle aging, on the other hand, frequently deposit crystals of tartrates, and in addition red wines deposit some pigmented tannins. Winemakers deliberately leave more tartrates and phenolics in wines designed for long aging in bottle so that they are able to develop the aromatic compounds that constitute bouquet."
"Acetic acid /əˈsiːtɪk/, systematically named ethanoic acid /ˌɛθəˈnoʊɪk/, is an acidic, colourless liquid and organic compound with the chemical formula CH3COOH (also written as CH3CO2H, C2H4O2, or HC2H3O2). Vinegar is no less than 4% acetic acid by volume, making acetic acid the main component of vinegar apart from water. Acetic acid is the second simplest carboxylic acid (after formic acid). It is an important chemical reagent and industrial chemical, used primarily in the production of cellulose acetate for photographic film, polyvinyl acetate for wood glue, and synthetic fibres and fabrics. In households, diluted acetic acid is often used in descaling agents. In the food industry, acetic acid is controlled by the food additive code E260 as an acidity regulator and as a condiment. In biochemistry, the acetyl group, derived from acetic acid, is fundamental to all forms of life. When bound to coenzyme A, it is central to the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats. The global demand for acetic acid is about 6.5 million metric tons per year (Mt/a), of which approximately 1.5 Mt/a is met by recycling; the remainder is manufactured from methanol. Vinegar is mostly dilute acetic acid, often produced by fermentation and subsequent oxidation of ethanol."
Hopeaphenol is a stilbenoid. It is a resveratrol tetramer. It has been first isolated from Dipterocarpaceae like . It has also been isolated from wines from North Africa. It shows an opposite effect to vitisin A on apoptosis of myocytes isolated from adult rat heart.
Vitisin B is a resveratrol tetramer found in plants of the genus Vitis.
"Tartaric acid is a white, crystalline organic acid that occurs naturally in many fruits, most notably in grapes, but also in bananas, tamarinds, and citrus. Its salt, potassium bitartrate, commonly known as cream of tartar, develops naturally in the process of fermentation. It is commonly mixed with sodium bicarbonate and is sold as baking powder used as a leavening agent in food preparation. The acid itself is added to foods as an antioxidant E334 and to impart its distinctive sour taste. Tartaric acid is an alpha-hydroxy-carboxylic acid, is diprotic and aldaric in acid characteristics, and is a dihydroxyl derivative of succinic acid."
"Isinglass (/ˈaɪzɪŋɡlæs, -ɡlɑːs/) is a substance obtained from the dried swim bladders of fish. It is a form of collagen used mainly for the clarification or fining of some beer and wine. It can also be cooked into a paste for specialised gluing purposes. The English word origin is from the obsolete Dutch huizenblaas – huizen is a kind of sturgeon, and blaas is a bladder, or German Hausenblase, meaning essentially the same. Although originally made exclusively from sturgeon, especially beluga, in 1795 an invention by William Murdoch facilitated a cheap substitute using cod. This was extensively used in Britain in place of Russian isinglass, and in the US hake was important. In modern British brewing all commercial isinglass products are blends of material from a limited range of tropical fish. The bladders, once removed from the fish, processed, and dried, are formed into various shapes for use."

"Alban wine is a notable wine of Ancient Rome that was grown in the Colli Albani (Alban Hills) region, 20 kilometres (12 mi) Southeast of Rome, at the foot of Mt. Albus. The area is now occupied by the modern day papal residence of Castelgandolfo. The land was praised by Columella ""For there is no doubt that, of all the vines that the earth sustains, those of the Massic, Surrentine, Alban, and Caecuban lands hold first place in the excellence of their wine"" (De Re Rustica, III.8.5). Dionysius of Halicarnassus noted the quality of the area's wine as he wrote ""Lying below the city are plains marvelous to behold and rich in producing wines and fruits of all sorts in no degree inferior to the rest of Italy, and particularly what they call the Alban wine, which is sweet and excellent and, with the exception of the Falernian, certainly superior to all others."" (Roman Antiquities Book 1)."
"Passum was a raisin wine (wine from semi-dried grapes) apparently developed in ancient Carthage (in now modern Tunisia) and transmitted from there to Italy, where it was popular in the Roman Empire. The earliest surviving instruction constitutes the only known Carthaginian recipe. It is a fragment from the Punic farming manual by Mago in its Latin translation by Decimus Junius Silanus (2nd century BC). It survives because it was summarised by Columella (1st century AD):"
Mutage /ˈmjuːtɪdʒ/ MEW-tij is a wine making technique for making sweet wines.
"A vineyard designated wine is a wine produced from the product of a single vineyard with that vineyard's name appearing on the wine label. Throughout the history of winemaking and viticulture, the differences in quality between one plot of land and another have been observed with the boundaries of these vineyard generally well demarcated. In Burgundy, the vineyards of the area are classified with the highest quality vineyards receiving the ranking of Grand cru. The names of these vineyards, such as Montrachet, will often appear on the wine label of Burgundy wines in bolder, more prominent print than even the name of the producer. In the United States, the appearance of vineyards name on wine labels is a relatively recent phenomenon with one of the first vineyard designated premium wines in California being the 1966 vintage Heitz Martha's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon. Later examples include the 1975 Robert Young Vineyard Chardonnay from the Sonoma wine estate of . On the East Coast, Unionville Vineyards produces single vineyard wines, primarily Chardonnay. Under US wine laws, if the name of vineyard appears on the label at least 95% of the grapes used to make the wine must come from that vineyard."
"Millet wine (Chinese: 小米酒; pinyin: Xiǎomǐ jiǔ) is a common wine in East and Southeast Asia. It is also the oldest wine in Taiwan and a traditional beverage of Taiwanese aborigines. It is often used in harvest festivals, as a symbol of harvest."
"Lychee wine (Chinese: 荔枝酒, lìzhījiǔ) is a full-bodied Chinese dessert wine made of 100% lychee fruit. This wine has a golden colour and rich, sweet taste. It is usually served ice cold, either straight up or on the rocks with food. Lychee wine is believed to pair better with shellfish and Asian cuisine than with heavier meat dishes. This refreshing beverage can also be used as a cocktail mixer paired with other spirits. Lychee wine is a low- alcohol and high-flavored Chinese beverage made of fresh lychee fruits using partial osmotic dehydration techniques. Most of the time, it contains 10-18% alcohol, 1-4% sugar and 0.3-1%% acid. The nutrients and flavour are concentrated and retained thanks to dehydration pretreatment and this is also can tell from the product the usage of untreated fruits. Lychee is made into wines that can be consumed fresh or a few years before serving. Lychee itself has a golden color and unique rosy flavor and lychee wines keep the subtle flavor of the berry in the wine but it is not overpowering. This wine is inherently sweet and pungent. However, additional tannin is usually added to the wine, in order to get rid of the loamy mellow tones."
"The China Wine and Spirits Awards (CWSA, Chinese:中国环球葡萄酒及烈酒大奖赛) wine and spirits competition is the biggest wine competition in Hong Kong and China. CWSA Judges together sell 75 million bottles of wine and spirits per year, making CWSA the most influential wine and spirits awards in the world. The competition is focused on finding wines and spirits for the Chinese market. The wines and spirits are judged by 100 Chinese wine and spirits buyers; Importers, Distributors, Retailers. Producers looking to expand into the Chinese market, and those already in the market enter their products for judging. Wines are blind tasted. The competition holds two competitions per year. Every Spring, China Wine and Spirits Best Value is held, the blind tasting is held by price range and wines and spirits that offer good value are awarded. The China Wine and Spirits Awards (CWSA) is held in Autumn and entrants are judged to find the best wines and spirits for the Chinese market. The awards receive entries from producers from more than 55 wine-producing countries."
"Muscatel (/ˌmʌskəˈtɛl/ MUSK-ə-TEL) is a type of wine made from muscat grapes. The term is now normally used in the United States to refer to a fortified wine made from these grapes rather than just any wine made from these grapes. This fortified muscatel became popular in the United States when, at the end of prohibition, in order to meet the large demand for wine, some poor strains of muscat grapes (used normally for table grapes or raisins) mixed with sugar and cheap brandy were used to produce what has since become infamous as a wino wine. This kind of fortified wine has, in the United States, damaged the reputation of all muscat-based wines and the term muscatel tends no longer to be used for these ""better"" wines in the United States. In other markets the term Muscatel, or Moscatel, refers to a wide range of sweet wines based on these grapes. In 16th-century Germany elderflower infused Salvia sclarea was added to Rhine wines to make a more potent varietal that was called ""Muscatel"", giving the plant one of its common names ""muscatel sage""."
"A carboy, also known as a demijohn, is a rigid container with a typical capacity of 4 to 60 litres (1 to 16 US gal). Carboys are primarily used for transporting liquids, often water or chemicals. They are also used for in-home fermentation of beverages, often beer or wine."
"Co-fermentation is the practice in winemaking of fermenting two or more grape varieties at the same time when producing a wine. This differs from the more common practice of blending separate wine components into a cuvée after fermentation. While co-fermentation in principle could be practiced for any mixture of grape varieties, it is today more common for red wines produced from a mixture of red grape varieties and a smaller proportion of white grape varieties. Co-fermentation is an old practice going back to the now uncommon practice of having field blends (mixed plantations of varieties) in vineyards, and the previous practice in some regions (such as Rioja and Tuscany) of using a small proportion of white grapes to ""soften"" some red wines which tended to have harsh tannins when produced with the winemaking methods of the time. It is believed that the practice may also have been adopted because it was found empirically to give deeper and better colour to wines, which is due to improved co-pigmentation resulting from some components in white grapes."
"A wine bar is a tavern-like business focusing on selling wine, rather than liquor or beer. A typical feature of many wine bars is a wide selection of wines available by the glass. Some wine bars are profiled on wines of a certain type of origin, such as Italian wine or Champagne. While many wine bars are private ""stand-alone"" establishments, in some cases, wine bars are associated with a specific wine retailer or other outlet of wine, to provide additional marketing for that retailer's wine portfolio. In countries where licensing regulations allow this, some wine bars also sell the wines they serve, and effective function as a hybrid between a wine shop and a wine bar."
"Espalier (/ɪˈspælɪər/ or /ɪˈspæli.eɪ/) is the horticultural and ancient agricultural practice of controlling woody plant growth for the production of fruit, by pruning and tying branches to a frame. Plants are frequently shaped in formal patterns, flat against a structure such as a wall, fence, or trellis, and also plants which have been shaped in this way. Espaliers, trained into flat two-dimensional forms, are used not only for decorative purposes, but also for gardens in which space is limited. In a temperate climate, espaliers may be trained next to a wall that can reflect more sunlight and retain heat overnight or orientated so that they absorb maximum sunlight by training them parallel to the equator.These two strategies allow the season to be extended so that fruit has more time to mature. A restricted form of training consists of a central stem and a number of paired horizontal branches all trained in the same plane. The most important advantage is that of being able to increase the growth of a branch by training it vertically. Later, one can decrease growth while increasing fruit production by training it horizontally."
"A carafe is a glass container without handles used for serving wine and other drinks. Unlike the related decanter, carafes do not include stoppers. Coffee pots included in coffee makers are also referred to as carafes in American English. In France, carafes are commonly used to serve water. To order a carafe d'eau (""carafe of water"") is to request to be served (free) tap water rather than bottled water at a cost. In Greece, in tavernas or similar establishments, carafes are normally used to serve draught wine."
"Coan wine is wine from the Greek island of Kos, and in particular a style of wine invented there in classical antiquity that was known for its saltiness."
"Retsina (Greek: Ρετσίνα) is a Greek white (or rosé) resinated wine, which has been made for at least 2,000 years. Its unique flavor is said to have originated from the practice of sealing wine vessels, particularly amphorae, with Aleppo Pine resin in ancient times. Before the invention of impermeable glass bottles, oxygen caused many wines to spoil within the year. Pine resin helped keep air out, while infusing the wine with resin aroma. The Romans began to use barrels in the 3rd century AD, removing any oenological necessity for resin, but the flavor itself was so popular that the style is still widespread today."
"Lesbos wine is wine made on the Greek island of Lesbos in the Aegean Sea. The island has a long history of winemaking dating back to at least the 7th century BC when it was mentioned in the works of Homer. During this time the area competed with the wines of Chios for the Greek market. An apocryphal account details one of the brothers of the poet Sappho as a merchant trading Lesbos wine with the Greek colony of Naucratis in Egypt. The most noted Lesbos wine was known as Pramnian which draws similarities today to the Hungarian wine Eszencia. The popularity of Lesbos wine continued into Roman times where it was highly valued along with other Aegean wines of Chios, Thasos and Kos."
"Cretan wine is wine from the Greek island of Crete. It has a long history since wine was certainly being made by the Minoans since the Bronze Age. Wines from Crete are not listed among those specially prized in classical Greece, but under the Roman Empire in the 2nd century AD Crete was known for a sweet wine, protropos, which was exported to Italy. In late medieval Europe, in the 14th to 16th centuries, vino di Candia (Heraklion is modern day Candia) and Crete are wine names listed as highly valued in several sources from western and northern Europe; they were sweet and ""hot"" wines (hot in a dietary sense). Within the current classification of Greek wine there are several Cretan appellations, including Peza, Archanes, Dafnes and Sitia."
The Guide Hachette des Vins is a French wine buying guide published by Hachette Livre (Hachette Pratique). Its first edition was released in 1985. It is France's best-selling wine guide and one of France's oldest. The Guide Hachette des Vins is considered to be France' most authoritative guide and commonly referred to as the bible of the French wine industry.
"Sherry (Spanish: Jerez [xeˈɾeθ]) is a fortified wine made from white grapes that are grown near the city of Jerez de la Frontera in Andalusia, Spain. Sherry is produced in a variety of styles made primarily from the Palomino grape, ranging from light versions similar to white table wines, such as Manzanilla and fino, to darker and heavier versions that have been allowed to oxidise as they age in barrel, such as Amontillado and oloroso. Sweet dessert wines are also made from Pedro Ximénez or Moscatel grapes, and are sometimes blended with Palomino-based sherries. Under the official name of Jerez-Xérès-Sherry, it is one of Spain's wine regions, a Denominación de Origen Protegida (DOP). The word sherry is an anglicisation of Xérès (Jerez). Sherry was previously known as sack, from the Spanish saca, meaning ""extraction"" from the solera. In Europe, ""Sherry"" has protected designation of origin status, and under Spanish law, all wine labelled as ""Sherry"" must legally come from the Sherry Triangle, an area in the province of Cádiz between Jerez de la Frontera, Sanlúcar de Barrameda, and El Puerto de Santa María. In 1933 the Jerez denominación de origen was the first Spanish denominación to be officially recognised in this way, officially named D.O. Jerez-Xeres-Sherry and sharing the same governing council as D.O. Manzanilla Sanlúcar de Barrameda. After fermentation is complete, the base wines are fortified with grape spirit in order to increase their final alcohol content. Wines classified as suitable for aging as fino and Manzanilla are fortified until they reach a total alcohol content of 15.5 per cent by volume. As they age in a barrel, they develop a layer of flor—a yeast-like growth that helps protect the wine from excessive oxidation. Those wines that are classified to undergo aging as oloroso are fortified to reach an alcohol content of at least 17 per cent. They do not develop flor and so oxidise slightly as they age, giving them a darker colour. Because the fortification takes place after fermentation, most sherries are initially dry, with any sweetness being added later. In contrast, port wine is fortified halfway through its fermentation, which stops the process so that not all of the sugar is turned into alcohol. Wines from different years are aged and blended using a solera system before bottling, so that bottles of sherry will not usually carry a specific vintage year and can contain a small proportion of very old wine. Sherry is regarded by some wine writers as ""underappreciated"" and a ""neglected wine treasure""."
"Winemaking or vinification is the production of wine, starting with the selection of the fruit, its fermentation into alcohol, and the bottling of the finished liquid. The history of wine-making stretches over millennia. The science of wine and winemaking is known as oenology. A winemaker may also be called a vintner. The growing of grapes is viticulture and there are many varieties of grapes. Winemaking can be divided into two general categories: still wine production (without carbonation) and sparkling wine production (with carbonation – natural or injected). Red wine, white wine, and rosé are the other main categories. Although most wine is made from grapes, it may also be made from other plants. (See fruit wine.) Other similar light alcoholic drinks (as opposed to beer or spirits) include mead, made by fermenting honey and water, and kumis, made of fermented mare's milk."
"Kannauj Perfume, also known as Kannauj Ittar, is a traditional Indian perfume manufacture. The perfume production is popular in Kannauj, in the Uttar Pradesh state, India. It has been protected under the Geographical indication (GI) of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement. It is listed at item 157 as ""Kannauj Perfume"" of the GI Act 1999 of the Government of India with registration confirmed by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks. Kannauj perfume has a long historical background and Kannauj had perfume trading for thousands of years. Due to the key role of perfume production in Kannauj, the city is known as ""the perfume capital of India"" and ""Kannauj is to India what Grasse is to France"". An expert in the region says, ""Kannauj has been the perfumery town of the country for thousands of years"". The attar manufacture skill passed through generation to generation. When a craftsman explains about their family involvement in this industry, he says ""My family has been working in this field since three centuries and my son is the 30th generation"". They make from flowers and natural resources. Also musk, camphor, saffron and other aromatic substances are used for production. Flower like white jasmine and plant like vetiver use for summer varieties while soil uses for monsoon variety, known as Mitti attar that gives the scent of wet earth. Heena attar and musk attar are winter varieties. The natural perfume is free of alcohol and chemical, except for some productions. Fragrant attar from rose has more smell while attar that made from sandalwood oil has lasting smell. Normally for production a small bottle of scent, it needs about 15 days. Kannauj perfume has local and international markets and about 20 companies export to foreign countries such as UK, USA, Australia, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Singapore, France, Oman, Qatar, etc."
"An amphora (/ˈæmfərə/; Ancient Greek: ἀμφορεύς, amphoreús; English plural: amphorae or amphoras) is a type of container with a pointed bottom and characteristic shape and size which fit tightly (and therefore safely) against each other in storage rooms and packages, tied together with rope and delivered by land or sea. The size and shape have been determined from at least as early as the Neolithic Period. Amphorae were used in vast numbers for the transport and storage of various products, both liquid and dry, but mostly for wine. They are most often ceramic, but examples in metals and other materials have been found. Versions of the amphorae were one of many shapes used in Ancient Greek vase painting. The amphora complements a vase, the pithos, which makes available capacities between one-half and two and one-half tons. In contrast, the amphora holds under a half-ton, typically less than 50 kilograms (110 lb). The bodies of the two types have similar shapes. Where the pithos may have multiple small loops or lugs for fastening a rope harness, the amphora has two expansive handles joining the shoulder of the body and a long neck. The necks of pithoi are wide for scooping or bucket access. The necks of amphorae are narrow for pouring by a person holding it by the bottom and a handle. Some variants exist. The handles might not be present. The size may require two or three handlers to lift. For the most part, however, an amphora was tableware, or sat close to the table, was intended to be seen, and was finely decorated as such by master painters. Stoppers of perishable materials, which have rarely survived, were used to seal the contents. Two principal types of amphorae existed: the neck amphora, in which the neck and body meet at a sharp angle; and the one-piece amphora, in which the neck and body form a continuous curve upwards. Neck amphorae were commonly used in the early history of ancient Greece, but were gradually replaced by the one-piece type from around the 7th century BC onward. Most were produced with a pointed base to allow upright storage by embedding in soft ground, such as sand. The base facilitated transport by ship, where the amphorae were packed upright or on their sides in as many as five staggered layers. If upright, the bases probably were held by some sort of rack, and ropes passed through their handles to prevent shifting or toppling during rough seas. Heather and reeds might be used as packing around the vases. Racks could be used in kitchens and shops. The base also concentrated deposits from liquids with suspended solid particles, such as olive oil and wines. Amphorae are of great use to maritime archaeologists, as they often indicate the age of a shipwreck and the geographic origin of the cargo. They are occasionally so well preserved that the original content is still present, providing information on foodstuffs and mercantile systems. Amphorae were too cheap and plentiful to return to their origin-point and so, when empty, they were broken up at their destination. At a breakage site in Rome, Testaccio, close to the Tiber, the fragments, later wetted with calcium hydroxide (calce viva), remained to create a hill now named Monte Testaccio, 45 m (148 ft) high and more than 1 kilometre in circumference."
"Fortified wine is a wine to which a distilled spirit, usually brandy, has been added. In the course of some centuries,winemakers have developed many different styles of fortified wine, including port, sherry, madeira, Marsala, Commandaria wine, and the aromatised wine vermouth."
"A barrel or cask is a hollow cylindrical container with a bulging center, longer than it is wide. They are traditionally made of wooden staves and bound by wood or metal hoops. The word vat is often used for large containers for liquids, usually alcoholic beverages; a small barrel or cask is known as a keg. Modern wooden barrels for wine-making are made of French common oak (Quercus robur), white oak (Quercus petraea), or American white oak (Quercus alba) and typically have standard sizes: 
* ""Bordeaux type"" 225 litres (59 US gal; 49 imp gal), 
* ""Burgundy type"" 228 litres (60 US gal; 50 imp gal) and 
* ""Cognac type"" 300 litres (79 US gal; 66 imp gal). Modern barrels and casks can also be made of aluminum, stainless steel, and different types of plastic, such as HDPE. Someone who makes barrels is called a ""barrel maker"" or cooper (coopers also make buckets, vats, tubs, butter churns, hogsheads, firkins, kegs, kilderkins, tierces, rundlets, puncheons, pipes, tuns, butts, pins, troughs and ). Barrels have a variety of uses, including storage of liquids such as water, oil, and alcohol arrack, and sake. They are also employed to hold maturing beverages such as wine, cognac, armagnac, sherry, port, whiskey, and beer. Other commodities once stored in wooden casks include gunpowder, meat, fish, paint, honey, nails and tallow. Early casks were bound with wooden hoops and in the 19th century these were gradually replaced by metal hoops that were stronger, more durable and took up less space. The term barrel can also refer to roughly cylindrical containers or drums made of modern materials like plastic, steel or aluminium. The barrel has also been used as a standard size of measure referring to a set capacity or weight of a given commodity. For example, in the UK a barrel of beer refers to a quantity of 36 imperial gallons (160 L; 43 US gal). Wine was shipped in barrels of 119 litres (31 US gal; 26 imp gal). A barrel of oil, defined as 42 US gallons (35 imp gal; 160 L), is still used as a measure of volume for oil, although oil is no longer shipped in barrels. The barrel has also come into use as a generic term for a wooden cask of any size."
"A wine bottle is a bottle, generally a glass bottle, that is used for holding wine. Some wines are fermented in the bottle while others are bottled only after fermentation. Recently the bottle has become a standard unit of volume to describe sales in the wine industry, measuring 750 millilitres (26.40 imp fl oz; 25.36 US fl oz). Wine bottles are produced, however, in a variety of volumes and shapes. Wine bottles are traditionally sealed with a cork, but screw-top caps are becoming popular, and there are several other methods used to seal a bottle."
"Sacramental wine, Communion wine, or altar wine is wine obtained from grapes and intended for use in celebration of the Eucharist (also referred to as the Lord's Supper or Holy Communion, among other names). It is usually consumed after sacramental bread."
"Vermouth (/vərˈmuːθ/, UK also /ˈvɜːrməθ/) is an aromatized fortified wine, flavoured with various botanicals (roots, barks, flowers, seeds, herbs, and spices) and sometimes colored. The modern versions of the beverage were first produced in the mid- to late 18th century in Turin, Italy. While vermouth was traditionally used for medicinal purposes, it was later served as an apéritif, with fashionable cafés in Turin serving it to guests around the clock. In the late 19th century it became popular with bartenders as a key ingredient for cocktails, such as the martini, the Manhattan, the Rob Roy, and the Negroni. In addition to being consumed as an apéritif or cocktail ingredient, vermouth is sometimes used as an alternative to white wine in cooking. Historically, there have been two main types of vermouth: sweet and dry. Responding to demand and competition, vermouth manufacturers have created additional styles, including extra-dry white, sweet white (blanc or bianco), red, amber (ambre or rosso), and rosé. Vermouth is produced by starting with a base of a neutral grape wine or unfermented wine must. Each manufacturer adds additional alcohol and a proprietary mixture of dry ingredients, consisting of aromatic herbs, roots, and barks, to the base wine, base wine plus spirit, or spirit only – which may be redistilled before adding to the wine or unfermented wine must. After the wine is aromatized and fortified, the vermouth is sweetened with either cane sugar or caramelized sugar, depending on the style. Italian and French companies produce most of the vermouth consumed throughout the world, although Spain, the United States and the United Kingdom are also noteworthy producers."
"Valtice Wine Market (in Czech: Valtické vinné trhy) is a wine exhibition held annually in the Valtice Chateau riding hall at the beginning of May. The Valtice Wine Market was first held at the end of the 19th century. The modern history of the Valtice Wine Market commenced in the year 1967, when this wine contest was held for the first time in its present fashion. Various prizes are awarded at this show: the jury awards one gold, one silver and one bronze medal for each category or variety of wine."
"Top Marques Monaco is an event that takes place annually at the Grimaldi Forum in the principality of Monaco.

"The Caxton Street Seafood and Wine Festival is an annual event which was launched in 1994 by the Caxton Street Development Association to promote Caxton Street in historic Petrie Terrace as a significant entertainment precinct that celebrates and promotes Australian music, seafood and wine. It features live music, food and drink from Caxton Street restaurants and cafés, as well as Art Exhibitions and Historical Displays and a dedicated annual Festival Band Competition. By 2012, the Festival attracted more than 15000 patrons. Proceeds from the Street Tickets are donated to various Queensland charities significantly in 2012 to the Wesley Hospital (Brisbane) Kim Walters Choices Program. Held traditionally on the Sunday of the Labour Day long weekend, until 2013, the Festival is a promotion of the Queensland Seafood and Wine industries as well as a major Queensland Music Festival. Since its inception in 1994, it has featuring artists such as Russell Crowe and 30 Odd Foot of Grunts, 1927, Boom Crash Opera, The Angels, Gang Gajang, Little Birdy, Grace Knight, Kevin Borich, Kram of Spiderbait, Dukes of Windsor, Calling All Cars, Don Walker (musician), Tyrone Noonan and Diana Anaid plus celebrities from Australian Idol, Big Brother and musical acts from all over Australia playing a variety of music styles. From 2014, it is held on the Queens Birthday long weekend in June. The Caxton Street Seafood Festival is located on Caxton Street, Brisbane only a short 200 m away from Suncorp Stadium and a few minutes from the Brisbane central business district. From 2003 to 2014, Manny Kyriakidis of The Pushworth Group, has produced the event's music programs and 2009–2014, Nichola Burton of Australian Festival Management has managed the annual festival and Sam Kyriakidis of Pressing Issues has been the Publicist. Due to illness, the Pushworth team took a break for 2015 and 2016. In 2011, inspired by the 2010–11 Queensland floods, Queensland Artist, Donna Hawkins, produced a vibrant artwork representation of Caxton Street, Brisbane specifically for the festival. Brisbane's iconic Caxton Street was left high and dry during Queensland's devastating floods that have again affected many parts of this great State. Having raised substantial funds for the Premiers Disaster Relief Appeal in 2011, Caxton Street donated part proceeds from all tickets sold to the Queensland Floods Appeal 2013. While Queenslanders have endured the worst, this natural disaster provides people the opportunity to show their best, and the Caxton Street Seafood & Wine Festival hopes to support those in the face of yet another challenge. The Caxton Street Seafood & Wine Festival continues its long standing relationship with the Wesley Hospital's Prostate Cancer Care program each year as charity partner. 2020 will see the event be moved to December."

"Lower Alsace (northern Alsace) was a landgraviate of the Holy Roman Empire held ex officio by the Bishop of Strasbourg. Prior to is acquisition by the bishopric, it was held by the . In 1174 Count Gottfried of Hüneburg was the landgrave when he got into a dispute with the near Hagenau. In the late Middle Ages the unity of Lower Alsace was lost. Strasbourg became an imperial city, owing allegiance to nobody save the emperor, and the great noble families gradually became extinct, their lands being inherited by families from across the Rhine. Lower Alsace thus had closer political connections with the rest of Germany than did Upper Alsace. After the bishop, the greatest landholder was the Count of . These nobles held vast estates outside of Alsace. The lesser nobility, confined in their holdings to Lower Alsace, but being immediate vassals of the emperor, were collectively known as the ""Immediate Nobles of Lower Alsace"". On 14 April 1646, the imperial ambassador Trauttmansdorff, during negotiations to end the Thirty Years' War, offered ""Upper and Lower Alsace and the Sundgau, under the title of Landgraviate of Alsace"" to the French. There was no such territory, since Alsace was at the time divided into several jurisdictions held by competing powers. The Archduke Ferdinand Charles held the landgraviate of Upper Alsace, while a relative held the Landvogtei (bailiwick) of Hagenau with a protectorate over the Décapole (a league of ten imperial cities)."
"The European Collectivity of Alsace (French: Collectivité européenne d'Alsace; Alsatian: D'Europäischa Gebiatskärwerschàft Elsàss; German: Europäische Gebietskörperschaft Elsass) is a territorial collectivity in the Alsace region of France. On 1 January 2021, the departments of Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin merged into a territorial collectivity but remained part of the region Grand Est. The creation of this new entity was voted by the French Parliament on 25 July 2019 and Law 2019-816 delimiting its powers was promulgated on 2 August 2019. Alsatian voters had already voted in favour of the creation of a single territorial collectivity in a referendum in 2013; however, in the less populous of the two departments, Haut-Rhin, a majority of voters had rejected the proposal."
"The County of Hanau-Lichtenberg was a territory in the Holy Roman Empire. It emerged between 1456–80 from a part of the County of Hanau and one half of the Barony of Lichtenberg. Following the extinction of the counts of Hanau-Lichtenberg in 1736 it went to Hesse-Darmstadt, minor parts of it to the Hesse-Cassel. Its centre was in the lower Alsace, the capital first Babenhausen, later Buchsweiler."

"The ghost pepper, also known as bhut jolokia (which literally means Bhutanese chilli in Assamese), is an interspecific hybrid chili pepper cultivated in Northeast India. It is a hybrid of Capsicum chinense and Capsicum frutescens and is closely related to the Naga Morich. In 2007, Guinness World Records certified that the ghost pepper was the world's hottest chili pepper, 170 times hotter than Tabasco sauce. The ghost chili is rated at more than one million Scoville Heat Units (SHUs). However, in the race to grow the hottest pepper, the ghost chili was superseded by the Trinidad Scorpion Butch T pepper in 2011 and the Carolina Reaper in 2013."
A wine rack is a set of shelves for the organized storage of wine. Wine racks can be built out of a number of different materials. The size of the rack and the number of bottles it can hold can vary widely. Wine racks can be located in a winemaker’s professional wine cellar as well as private homes for personal collections.
"A fruit press is a device used to separate fruit solids - stems, skins, seeds, pulp, leaves, and detritus - from fruit juice."
"Bottle-shock or Bottle-sickness is a temporary condition of wine characterized by muted or disjointed fruit flavors. It often occurs immediately after bottling or when wines (usually fragile wines) are given an additional dose of sulfur (in the form of sulfur dioxide or sulfite solution). After a few weeks, the condition usually disappears."
"Millerandage (or shot berries, hens and chicks and pumpkins and peas) is a potential viticultural hazard problem in which grape bunches contain berries that differ greatly in size and, most importantly, maturity. Its most common cause is cold, rainy or otherwise bad weather during the flowering stage of the vines though other factors, such as boron deficiency or fanleaf degeneration, may also play a role. While millerandage will always cause a drop in yield, its potential impact on wine quality will vary, particularly by grape variety. For some varieties that are prone to uneven ripeness within a cluster, such as Sangiovese, Zinfandel and Gewürztraminer, the development of millerandage may be unfavorable due to ""green flavors"" from the potentially unripe grapes hidden within the cluster. For other varieties, such as Pinot noir or the Mendoza clone of Chardonnay, wine quality could be improved due to the reduced overall berry size and higher skin to juice ratio."
"In viticulture, veraison (French: véraison, IPA: [veʁɛzɔ̃]) is the onset of the ripening of the grapes. The official definition of veraison is ""change of color of the grape berries"". Veraison represents the transition from berry growth to berry ripening, and many changes in berry development occur at veraison."

"Grapevine virus A (GVA) is a moderately common genetic virus that affects Vitis vinifera and American Vitis grapevine species throughout the world and can be fatal if not treated. Grapevine virus A is in the family Betaflexiviridae and genus Vitivirus. The common name for this virus is grapevine closterovirus. Common symptoms in infected grapevines include stem pitting (when the outer layer of the stems of the grapevine to peel off). Although there is a treatment available to cure infected grapevines, it is not one hundred percent effective, so preventative measures are the best solution to the virus. Every inhabited continent on the globe has had breakouts of grapevine closterovirus due to the complex genetic makeup of the virus. Grapevine virus A has a single-stranded RNA genome, which is similar to that of Grapevine virus B. There are multiple strains of the virus that vary both molecularly and biologically which account for the slightly different symptoms exhibited by infected plants."

"Grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV) is a plant pathogenic virus of the family Secoviridae. It infects grapevines, causing chlorosis of the leaves and lowering the fruit quality. Because of its effect on grape yield, GFLV is a pathogen of commercial importance. It is transmitted via a nematode vector, Xiphinema index. This nematode acquires the virus through feeding on roots of an infected plant, and passes it on in the same manner. Host and Symptoms: The host for Grapevine fanleaf virus or GFLV is the vitis species. This includes V. vinifera, V. rupestris, and hybrids. The symptoms of GFLV are “distortion of leaves and may cause unusual chlorotic (yellow) patterns on leaves, such as a yellow mosaic or yellow veins.”(5) Plants infected with GFLV also will have a reduced size and the fruit will be softer when compared to fruit from healthy plants. The leaves will be “severely distorted, asymmetrical, cupped and puckered, and exhibit acute dentations”, these symptoms tend to look like a fan, hence the name fanleaf virus. The canes may also show signs of abnormal branching, double nodding, and short internodes. Affected vines can also show signs of yellow mosaic which may affect all parts of the vine. The berries of the plant have a reduced yield and are smaller. They also have irregular ripening times.(4) Disease Cycle: The disease is spread by Xiphinema index a dagger nematode. The typical life cycle of Xiphinema index nematode goes through 6 life cycle stages. The females lay the eggs into the soil. Once the juveniles hatch from the egg they go through 4 molting stages where they get bigger after each molt. The nematode feeds and attacks the plant at all stages except when it's an egg. It uses its stylist to feed on the plant. During the feeding the nematode secretes enzymes into the plant to digest plant cells. During the feeding process the nematode can transfer the disease into the plant and it is also at this point that the nematode can become a carrier of the pathogen if it is not one already.(6) Management: To prevent GFLV planting certified disease free plants will make it so that the nematodes can not spread the disease unless they already have the pathogen. Another prevention method is the disinfect the pruning tools between each plant to help reduce the amount of disease spread from humans. An additional way to manage the disease is to get rid of any diseased plants and before the season starts test the soil for GLFV.(7) Finally, you can cover the crops with nematicidal properties and deep plow the fields and use nematode resistant rootstocks.(5)"
Grapevine chrome mosaic virus (GCMV) is a plant pathogenic virus of the family Secoviridae.
Grapevine yellow speckle viroid 1 is a type of viroid that infects grapevine.
Tobacco necrosis virus A is a plant pathogenic virus of the family Tombusviridae.
"Grapevine red blotch disease (GRBD), also known simply as red blotch, is a viral disease of grapevine. The disease is caused by a single-stranded circular DNA virus, the species grapevine red blotch virus, also known as grapevine red blotch-associated virus, GRBaV. First identified in California, the disease affects grapevines of all varieties and is internationally present. Symptoms typically include red blotches on the leaves of red varieties and in pale green or pale yellow blotches on white varieties. It significantly reduces the value of juice collected from the berries of affected vines, costing vineyard owners as much as $65,000 per acre. The discovery of red blotch and GRBaV is jointly credited to , a USDA-ARS virologist stationed at UC Davis, and Keith Perry and , virologists from Cornell. The three-cornered alfalfa treehopper was confirmed as a vector for the disease in 2016, but there are currently no advised treatments for red blotch other than removing and replacing affected vines."
"Ganjam Kewda is a male flower of the fragrant screwpine plant used for extracting kewda oil in India. A native to the tropics, it is registered (on Application No. 229) under the Geographical Indications (GI) of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act by Government of India. Kewda scent is produced in Chhatrapur, Brahmapur, Gopalpur and in district of Ganjam, Odisha. Although kewda plants can be found through most of India, 90% of the commercial production of the kewda flower is estimated to occur in the Odisha state. The flower of the kewda plant grows on a small tree or shrub; it is both cultivated and grows wild in coastal areas. The plant can also be found in some inland districts but the flowers seem to create their most exquisite floral bouquet in certain coastal localities, the most famous being the Ganjam district of Odisha. The tree can reach a height of 18 feet, with dense branches supported by aerial roots that can form a thick, almost impenetrable jungle. The long leaves possess prickly spines along the edges and mid-ribs making the plant tough to handle for those not familiar with the handling and harvesting techniques. The male flower ""spikes"" (or inflorescence) are 10-20 inches long. Along the central stalk of each spike one can find many flowers, each encased in a fragrant cream-colored spathe (a spathe is a protective leaf enclosing a flower). A fully mature kewda tree produces about 30 to 40 flower spikes each year weighing 5 to 6 each ounces each."
"Yeast assimilable nitrogen or YAN is the combination of free amino nitrogen (FAN), ammonia (NH3) and ammonium (NH4+) that is available for the wine yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to use during fermentation. Outside of the fermentable sugars glucose and fructose, nitrogen is the most important nutrient needed to carry out a successful fermentation that doesn't end prior to the intended point of dryness or sees the development of off-odors and related wine faults. To this extent winemakers will often supplement the available YAN resources with nitrogen additives such as diammonium phosphate (DAP). However, the addition of excessive amounts of nitrogen can also create a hazard as other organisms besides beneficial wine yeast can utilize the nutrients. These include spoilage organisms such as Brettanomyces, Acetobacter and Lactic acid bacteria from the Lactobacillus and Pediococcus genera. This is why many wineries will measure the YAN after harvest and crushing using one of several methods available today including the nitrogen by o-phthaldialdehyde assay (NOPA) which requires the use of a spectrometer or the Formol titration method. Knowing the YAN in the must allows winemakers to calculate the right amount of additive needed to get through fermentation, leaving only ""nutrient desert"" for any spoilage organisms that come afterwards. The amount of YAN that winemakers will see in their grape musts depends on a number of components including grape variety, rootstock, vineyard soils and viticultural practices (such as the use of fertilizers and canopy management) as well as the climate conditions of particular vintages."
"Vintage, in winemaking, is the process of picking grapes and creating the finished product—wine (see Harvest (wine)). A vintage wine is one made from grapes that were all, or primarily, grown and harvested in a single specified year. In certain wines, it can denote quality, as in Port wine, where Port houses make and declare vintage Port in their best years. From this tradition, a common, though not strictly correct, usage applies the term to any wine that is perceived to be particularly old or of a particularly high quality. Most countries allow a vintage wine to include a portion of wine that is not from the year denoted on the label. In Chile and South Africa, the requirement is 75% same-year content for vintage-dated wine. In Australia, New Zealand, and the member states of the European Union, the requirement is 85%. In the United States, the requirement is 85%, unless the wine is designated with an AVA, (e.g., Napa Valley), in which case it is 95%. Technically, the 85% rule in the United States applies equally to imports, but there are difficulties in enforcing the regulation. The opposite of a vintage wine is a nonvintage wine (often seen on a wine list as NV), which is usually a blend from the produce of two or more years. This is a common practice for winemakers seeking a consistent style of wine, year on year."
"Micro-oxygenation is a process used in winemaking to introduce oxygen into wine in a controlled manner. Developed in 1991 by , working with the exceptionally tannic grape Tannat in Madiran, the process gained usage in modern winemaking following the 1996 authorization by the European Commission. Today, the technique is widely employed in Bordeaux, as well as at least 11 different countries, including the United States and Chile."
"Maceration is the winemaking process where the phenolic materials of the grape—tannins, coloring agents (anthocyanins) and flavor compounds—are leached from the grape skins, seeds and stems into the must. To macerate is to soften by soaking, and maceration is the process by which the red wine receives its red color, since raw grape juice (with the exceptions of teinturiers) is clear-grayish in color. In the production of white wines, maceration is either avoided or allowed only in very limited manner in the form of a short amount of skin contact with the juice prior to pressing. This is more common in the production of varietals with less natural flavor and body structure like Sauvignon blanc and Sémillon. For Rosé, red wine grapes are allowed some maceration between the skins and must, but not to the extent of red wine production. While maceration is a technique usually associated with wine, it is used with other drinks, such as Lambic, piołunówka, Campari and crème de cassis, and also used to steep unflavored spirit with herbs for making herb-based alcohol like absinthe."
"Secondary fermentation is a process commonly associated with winemaking, which entails a second period of fermentation in a different vessel than the one used to start the fermentation process. An example of this would be starting fermentation in a carboy or stainless steel tank and then moving it over to oak barrels. Rather than being a separate, second fermentation, this is most often one single fermentation period that is conducted in multiple vessels. However, the term does also apply to procedures that could be described as a second and distinct fermentation period."
"Chaptalization is the process of adding sugar to unfermented grape must in order to increase the alcohol content after fermentation. The technique is named after its developer, the French chemist Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal. This process is not intended to make the wine sweeter, but rather to provide more sugar for the yeast to ferment into alcohol. Chaptalization has generated controversy and discontent in the French wine industry due to advantages that the process is perceived to give producers in poor-climate areas. In response to violent demonstrations by protesters in 1907, the French government began regulating the amount of sugar that can be added to wine. Chaptalization is sometimes referred to as enrichment, for example in the European Union wine regulations specifying the legality of the practice within EU. The legality of chaptalization varies by country, region, and even wine type. In general, it is legal in regions that produce grapes with low sugar content, such as the northern regions of France, Germany, and the United States. Chaptalization is, however, prohibited in Argentina, Australia, California, Italy, Spain and South Africa. Germany prohibits the practice for making Prädikatswein."
"Pressing in winemaking is the process where the juice is extracted from the grapes with the aid of a wine press, by hand, or even by the weight of the grape berries and clusters. Historically, intact grape clusters were trodden by feet but in most wineries today the grapes are sent through a crusher/destemmer, which removes the individual grape berries from the stems and breaks the skins, releasing some juice, prior to being pressed. There are exceptions, such as the case of sparkling wine production in regions such as Champagne where grapes are traditionally whole-cluster pressed with stems included to produce a lighter must that is low in phenolics. In white wine production, pressing usually takes place immediately after crushing or/and before primary fermentation. In red wine production, the grapes are also crushed but pressing usually doesn't take place till after or near the end of fermentation with the time of skin contact between the juice and grapes leaching color, tannins and other phenolics from the skin. Approximately 60-70% of the available juice within the grape berry, the free-run juice, can be released by the crushing process and doesn't require the use of the press. The remaining 30-40% that comes from pressing can have higher pH levels, lower titratable acidity, potentially higher volatile acidity and higher phenolics than the free-run juice depending on the amount of pressure and tearing of the skins and will produce more astringent, bitter wine. Winemakers often keep their free-run juice and pressed wine separate (and perhaps even further isolate the wine produced by different pressure levels/stages of pressing) during much of the winemaking process to either bottle separately or later blend portions of each to make a more complete, balanced wine. In practice the volume of many wines are made from 85-90% of free-run juice and 10-15% pressed juice."
"Maderisation is a process that involves the heating and oxidisation of a wine. The term is named after the process used in the production of Madeira wine, where it occurs while the wine is in cask. The resulting wine darkens in color and acquires a Sherry-like character. Outside Madeira wine, it is generally seen as a wine fault, but is desirable in the case of certain dessert wines where it occurs over the course of long bottle aging.

"Irrigation in viticulture is the process of applying extra water in the cultivation of grapevines. It is considered both controversial and essential to wine production. In the physiology of the grapevine, the amount of available water affects photosynthesis and hence growth, as well as the development of grape berries. While climate and humidity play important roles, a typical grape vine needs 25-35 inches (635-890 millimeters) of water a year, occurring during the spring and summer months of the growing season, to avoid stress. A vine that does not receive the necessary amount of water will have its growth altered in a number of ways; some effects of water stress (particularly, smaller berry size and somewhat higher sugar content) are considered desirable by wine grape growers. In many Old World wine regions, natural rainfall is considered the only source for water that will still allow the vineyard to maintain its terroir characteristics. The practice of irrigation is viewed by some critics as unduly manipulative with the potential for detrimental wine quality due to high yields that can be artificially increased with irrigation. It has been historically banned by the European Union's wine laws, though in recent years individual countries (such as Spain) have been loosening their regulations and France's wine governing body, the Institut National des Appellations d'Origine (INAO), has also been reviewing the issue. In very dry climates that receive little rainfall, irrigation is considered essential to any viticultural prospects. Many New World wine regions such as Australia and California regularly practice irrigation in areas that couldn't otherwise support viticulture. Advances and research in these wine regions (as well as some Old World wine regions such as Israel), have shown that potential wine quality could increase in areas where irrigation is kept to a minimum and managed. The main principle behind this is controlled water stress, where the vine receives sufficient water during the budding and flowering period, but irrigation is then scaled back during the ripening period so that the vine then responds by funneling more of its limited resources into developing the grape clusters instead of excess foliage. If the vine receives too much water stress, then photosynthesis and other important processes such as nutrient storage could be impacted with the vine essentially shutting down. The availability of irrigation means that if drought conditions emerge, sufficient water can be provided for the plant so that the balance between water stress and development is kept to optimal levels."
"Fermentation is a metabolic process that produces chemical changes in organic substrates through the action of enzymes. In biochemistry, it is narrowly defined as the extraction of energy from carbohydrates in the absence of oxygen. In food production, it may more broadly refer to any process in which the activity of microorganisms brings about a desirable change to a foodstuff or beverage. The science of fermentation is known as zymology. In microorganisms, fermentation is the primary means of producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by the degradation of organic nutrients anaerobically. Humans have used fermentation to produce foodstuffs and beverages since the Neolithic age. For example, fermentation is used for preservation in a process that produces lactic acid found in such sour foods as pickled cucumbers, kombucha, kimchi, and yogurt, as well as for producing alcoholic beverages such as wine and beer. Fermentation also occurs within the gastrointestinal tracts of all animals, including humans."
"The annual growth cycle of grapevines is the process that takes place in the vineyard each year, beginning with bud break in the spring and culminating in leaf fall in autumn followed by winter dormancy. From a winemaking perspective, each step in the process plays a vital role in the development of grapes with ideal characteristics for making wine. Viticulturalists and vineyard managers monitor the effect of climate, vine disease and pests in facilitating or impeding the vine's progression from bud break, flowering, fruit set, veraison, harvesting, leaf fall and dormancy-reacting if need be with the use of viticultural practices like canopy management, irrigation, vine training and the use of agrochemicals. The stages of the annual growth cycle usually become observable within the first year of a vine's life. The amount of time spent at each stage of the growth cycle depends on a number of factors-most notably the type of climate (warm or cool) and the characteristics of the grape variety."

"The Prince of Wales is a cocktail created by Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, who later became King Edward VII. There are several variations of the cocktail, but what they usually have in common is champagne, angostura bitters, sugar (or simple syrup), either rye whiskey or cognac, and a liqueur. An anonymous biography of King Edward, The Private Life of King Edward VII, credits the drink to the Prince himself. The cocktail consisted of ""a little rye whisky, crushed ice, a small square of pineapple, a dash of Angostura bitters, a piece of lemon peel, a few drops of Maraschino, a little champagne, and powdered sugar to taste."" Sam Meyer, in Cocktailians blog, puts the quantities at 
* 1 1/2 oz. (4.5 cl) rye 
* 1 oz. (3 cl) Champagne 
* 1 small piece pineapple 
* 1 dash Angostura bitters 
* 1/4 tsp (0.125 cl) Maraschino liqueur 
* 1 tsp (0.5 cl) sugar (or simple syrup) The drink is prepared by stirring sugar and bitters, adding whiskey and liqueur, then pineapple. These are shaken with crushed ice, the mix is strained into a cocktail glass, and then one adds the champagne. Some recipes use cognac or brandy instead of rye whiskey, Bénédictine or other liqueur in lieu of Maraschino, and orange in the place of pineapple. The methods of preparation also vary. Meyer says that the cocktail is ""a marvelous drink with the spicy rye ... and the sweet Maraschino and pineapple playing off each other and the bubbly tying it all together."" According to André Dominé, Prince of Wales has bitter, sweet, and sour in perfect harmony."
"Don Alfredo is a popular cocktail of modern Peruvian cuisine. The drink is prepared by mixing Peruvian mosto verde pisco, elderflower infused liquor such as St-Germain and lime juice in a cocktail glass filled with ice. The glass is then topped off with sparkling mineral water. It is usually served over ice in a lowball glass (or sometimes a martini glass or wine glass) and garnished with a spring of mint leaf, basil or a lime peel. Other variants include the Don Alfredo Spritz, which adds champagne or cava to the mix, and a plethora of modified versions."
"Wine sauce is a culinary sauce prepared with wine as a primary ingredient, heated and mixed with stock, butter, herbs, spices, onions, garlic and other ingredients. Several types of wines may be used, including red wine, white wine and port wine. Some versions are prepared using a reduction. Several types of wine sauces exist, and it is used in many dishes, including those prepared with seafood, poultry and beef.Wine sauces are associated with French cuisine."
"Grape syrup is a condiment made with concentrated grape juice. It is thick and sweet because of its high ratio of sugar to water. Grape syrup is made by boiling grapes, removing their skins, squeezing them through a sieve to extract the juice, and adding sugar. Like other fruit syrups, a common use of grape syrup is as a topping to sweet cakes, such as pancakes or waffles."
"A wine fault or defect is an unpleasant characteristic of a wine often resulting from poor winemaking practices or storage conditions, and leading to wine spoilage. Many of the compounds that cause wine faults are already naturally present in wine but at insufficient concentrations to be of issue. In fact, depending on perception, these concentrations may impart positive characters to the wine. However, when the concentration of these compounds greatly exceeds the sensory threshold, they replace or obscure the flavors and aromas that the wine should be expressing (or that the winemaker wants the wine to express). Ultimately the quality of the wine is reduced, making it less appealing and sometimes undrinkable. There are many causes for the perception in wine faults, including poor hygiene at the winery, excessive or insufficient exposure of the wine to oxygen, excessive or insufficient exposure of the wine to sulphur, overextended maceration of the wine either pre- or post-fermentation, faulty fining, filtering and stabilization of the wine, the use of dirty oak barrels, over-extended barrel aging and the use of poor quality corks. Outside of the winery, other factors within the control of the retailer or end user of the wine can contribute to the perception of flaws in the wine. These include poor storage of the wine that exposes it to excessive heat and temperature fluctuations as well as the use of dirty stemware during wine tasting that can introduce materials or aromas to what was previously a clean and fault-free wine."
"Flurbereinigung is the German word best translated as land consolidation. Unlike the land reforms carried out in the socialist countries of the Eastern Bloc, including East Germany, the idea of Flurbereiningung was not so much to distribute large quasi-feudal holdings to the formerly landless rural workers and/or to Kolkhoz-style cooperatives, but rather to correct the situation where after centuries of equal division of the inheritance of small farmers among their heirs and unregulated sales, most farmers owned many small non-adjacent plots of land, making access and cultivation difficult and inefficient. Two other European countries where this kind of land reform has been carried out are France (remembrement) and the Netherlands (ruilverkaveling). Although these reforms had been anticipated by agricultural planners since the beginning of the 19th century, they were not executed in grand scale until the time about 1950. These reforms sought to improve agricultural efficiency and support the infrastructure. Basis in Germany was a law passed in 1953 called ″Flurbereinigungsgesetz″, latest amendment from 1976. After criticism about loss of biodiversity caused by large-scale land reforms began to be voiced in the late 1970s, restoring the natural environment became another objective."
"Mangalore Buns is a popular breakfast or tea time snacks in the Udupi-Mangalore region of Karnataka, India. This food belongs to Tulu Mangalorean cuisine or Udupi cuisine. The buns are mild sweet, soft fluffy puris made using all purpose flour and banana. These buns are also called as banana buns or pooris.

Mangalore Buns was first created in the Mangalore region."
"Bikaneri bhujia, often simply called bhujia, is a popular crispy snack prepared by using moth beans and besan (gram flour) and spices, originating from Bikaner, a city in the western state of Rajasthan in India. Light yellow in colour, it has become not just a characteristic product of Bikaner, but also a generic name. Each variety prepared by large scale manufacturers also go through a rigorous testing procedure. This ensures that every new variety though mixed with different ingredients does not lose its basic nature. Bikaneri bhujia has been a cottage industry in Bikaner, Rajasthan, and provides employment to around 2.5 million people in villages of the region, especially women, and recently it has faced competition with multinational companies like Pepsico as well as Indian snack companies, which have used the name bhujia. After struggling with numerous copycats over the years, in September 2010, the Indian Patent Office confirmed the Geographical Indications rights and a patent was issued for the brand name Bikaneri bhujia to local manufacturers of Bikaner."
"Mathura peda is a North Indian sweet dish that originated from Mathura in India. In North India sweets prepared from mawa (khoya) are very popular and the peda is also a mawa sweet variety.

It usually includes a variety of rituals performed by both men and women alike."
"Coulure (pronounced coo-LYUR) is a viticultural hazard that is the result of metabolic reactions to weather conditions that causes a failure of grapes to develop after flowering. In English the word shatter is sometimes used. Coulure is triggered by periods of cold, cloudy, rainy weather or very high out-of-season temperatures. The condition is most often manifested in the spring. It also occurs in vines that have little sugar content in their tissue. Flowers stay closed and are not fertilized. Thus the vines are not pollinated as the grape fails to develop and falls off. Coulure can also cause irregular bunches of grapes which are less compact than normal. These bunches are more sensitive to developing various grape diseases. The yield of a vine with coulure will decrease substantially. Grape varieties with high proclivity to coulure are Grenache, Malbec, Merlot, and Muscat Ottonel. Other causes of coulure may be vineyard conditions and practices, pruning too early or too severely, excessively fertile soils or overuse of fertilizers, and improper selection of rootstocks or clones. During the flowering part of the growing season (May-June in the Northern Hemisphere, November-December in the Southern Hemisphere), grapevines often need dry conditions with sufficient sunlight and ambient air temperature around 15 °C (59 °F) for pollination to go smoothly. Less ideal conditions, particularly wet, rainy weather, increases the odds that a higher than normal numbers of flowers go unpollinated and coulure to occur. Coulure is a distinct phenomena unrelated to another viticultural hazard, millerandage, where the flowers are pollinated but the resulting berries develop without seeds and remain small. Like coulure, millerandage is often caused by inclement weather during the flowering and fruit set period and cause reduced yields."

"In viticulture, ripeness is the completion of the ripening process of wine grapes on the vine which signals the beginning of harvest. What exactly constitutes ripeness will vary depending on what style of wine is being produced (sparkling, still, fortified, rosé, dessert wine, etc.) and what the winemaker and viticulturist personally believe constitutes ripeness. Once the grapes are harvested, the physical and chemical components of the grape which will influence a wine's quality are essentially set so determining the optimal moment of ripeness for harvest may be considered the most crucial decision in winemaking. There are several factors that contribute to the ripeness of the grape. As the grapes go through veraison, sugars in the grapes will continue to rise as acid levels fall. The balance between sugar (as well as the potential alcohol level) and acids is considered one of the most critical aspects of producing quality wine so both the must weight and ""total acidity"", as well as the pH of the grapes, are evaluated to determine ripeness. Towards the end of the 20th century, winemakers and viticulturists began focusing on the concept of achieving ""physiological"" ripeness in the grapes-described as a more complete ripeness of tannins and other phenolic compounds in the grapes that contribute to the color, flavor and aroma of wine."

"Viticulture (from the Latin word for vine) or winegrowing (wine growing) is the cultivation and harvesting of grapes. It is a branch of the science of horticulture. While the native territory of Vitis vinifera, the common grape vine, ranges from Western Europe to the Persian shores of the Caspian Sea, the vine has demonstrated high levels of adaptability to new environments, hence viticulture can be found on every continent except Antarctica. Duties of the viticulturist include monitoring and controlling pests and diseases, fertilizing, irrigation, canopy management, monitoring fruit development and characteristics, deciding when to harvest, and vine pruning during the winter months. Viticulturists are often intimately involved with winemakers, because vineyard management and the resulting grape characteristics provide the basis from which winemaking can begin.A great number of varieties are now approved in the European Union as true grapes for winegrowing and viticulture."
"Oenology (enology; /iːˈnɒlədʒi/ ee-NOL-o-jee) is the science and study of wine and winemaking. It is distinct from viticulture, which is concerned with the cultivation and harvest of grapes.

"Vine pull schemes are programs whereby grape growers receive a financial incentive to pull up their grape vines, a process known as arrachage in French. A large program of this kind was initiated by the European Union (EU) in 1988 to reduce the wine lake glut from overproduction and declining demand. In the first five years of the program, growers, mainly in southern France and southern Italy, were paid to destroy 320,000 hectares or 790,400 acres (3,199 km2) of vineyard. This was the equivalent to the entire vineyard area of the world's fourth largest grower of grapes, the United States. The EU has recently resumed a vine pull scheme and Plan Bordeaux proposes additional vine pulls to increase prices for generic Bordeaux wine. It is believed that this has contributed to the ""global wine shortage"". Research by America's Morgan Stanley financial services firm says demand for wine ""exceeded supply by 300m cases in 2012""."
"Puttonyos is a unit for the level of sugar in Hungarian Tokaji (or tokay) and Slovak Tokaj dessert wine. It is traditionally measured by the number of hods of sweet botrytised or nobly rotted grapes (known as Aszú) added to a barrel of wine, but is now measured in grams of residual sugar. The puttony was actually the 25 kg basket or hod of Aszú grapes, and the more added to the barrel of wine, the sweeter the eventual wine. Measurement ranges from 3 to 6 Puttonyos. A Tokaji made entirely from Aszú grapes is not labeled using the Puttonyos system but is known as Eszencia."
"Egri Bikavér (Bull's Blood of Eger) is a blended red wine produced in Eger, Hungary. It is very representative of the red wines of Eger, a terroir wine, which carries the flavour of the soils of local production sites, the mezzo-climate unique to the region and the traditions and mores of local residents, from the selection of varieties to choosing the period and method of grape processing and mellowing. The exact date of the emergence of Egri Bikavér is unknown. One thing is certain; the word Bikavér (bull's blood) was recorded as early as the beginning of the 19th century. Under the name Bikavér, full-bodied red wines were sold, not only in Eger and Szekszárd but other places as well. Legends grew up around the name, which tied it to the 1552 siege of Eger as related by Gárdonyi Géza.In its present form, also accepted by the public, Egri Bikavér is associated with the name of Grőber Jenő, Eger vigneron. Sugár István (1981) writes: 'I have searched different sources for the composition of grape types constituting bull's blood. The earliest record dates back to 1912, when, in addition to kadarka, I have found blue frank, cabernet and merlot'. Contemporary vignerons and winemakers have been refining the conditions of the production, name, classification and control of this wine for the past two decades. The result of this activity is that Egri Bikavér became the first quality wine in Hungary's history to be produced in a specified region. (Egri Bikavér Regulation of 1997) At present, Egri Bikavér is produced in accordance with a regulation designating 3 tiers of quality: classicus, superior and grand superior. The product description contains the rules of yield restriction, fermentation sur marc, aging in barrels and bottles, as well as the marketing and trading of the wines, for the different tiers. Egri Bikavér is a Kékfrankos-based dry red wine blend, ranging from garnet red to deep ruby, with flavours and aromas presenting rich, spicy and fruity characteristics, without a tannin accent. Aging and fresh fruit aromas are both characteristic of the wine; its complexity is well illustrated by the fact that the characteristic feature of the wine is that no single grape type can dominate the wine in question. Due to the riper, more concentrated grape produce, as well as the extended aging in barrels and bottles, Superior and Grand Superior wines have marked aromas of mellowing, lasting flavours, full body and a long shelf-life with minerality and ideas in harmony with the production areas (sites). The difference between them is usually manifested in the fullness and duration of the aroma."

A monopole (French for 'monopoly') is an area controlled by a single winery (wine company) and can be as small as a named vineyard (lieu-dit) or as large as an entire appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC). Frequently this is mentioned on the label as it is rare for only one winery to produce all the wine from an area entitled to a certain name. Each wine is sold by only one company. The Napoleonic inheritance laws typically caused vineyards to be so finely divided among inheritors -down to even a single row of vines- that négociants are needed to bottle commercial quantities of a wine. Whether a monopole indicates a wine of unusual quality or not is a matter of debate.
"A cider mill, also known as a cidery, is the location and equipment used to crush apples into apple juice for use in making apple cider, hard cider, applejack, apple wine, pectin and other products derived from apples. More specifically, it refers to a device used to crush or grind apples as part of the overall juice production. The mills used to manufacture, ferment, store, and ship juice products are usually located near apple orchards. Historically, the types of structure and machinery have varied greatly—including horse powered, water driven, and machine operated mills. The presses can be fixed or portable. Cider mills were subject to legal proceedings in New York state in the 1800s over whether they were ""fixed to freeholds"" and other cases addressing legal designation as to what kind of property a cider mill is."
"Elgin is a large, lush area of land, circled by mountains, in the Overberg region of South Africa. This broad upland valley lies about 70 km southeast of Cape Town, just beyond the Hottentots Holland Mountains. The Elgin region is centered on the town of Grabouw. The Elgin Valley is one of the more intensively farmed districts of South Africa and produces 60% of the national apple crop. Consequently it is now internationally known as the place in South Africa “where the apples come from”. However a recent shift in economic focus has led to Elgin also becoming one of South Africa's most notable and successful wine regions, with the coolest climate of any region in the country. Elgin wines and tourism have consequently become significant parts of the valley's economy."

"The mukataa (mukata’a) was a tax district, according to the systems applied widely during the centuries of decline of the Ottoman state's fiscal mechanism. The Chora Metsovo was a mukataa, meaning a tax district, the proceeds of which were leased out to malikâne, or lifelong tenants of tax districts. In the Ottoman Empire, the term mukataa referred to districts or regions, parts of state goods, or other sources of revenue which, in order to facilitate its operation, the state would concede to iltizâm, i.e. to private individuals for a set period of time (tahvi). These districts were granted for tenure through an auction (müzayede) to the person who offered to pay the highest bid to the state treasury. Seeing that temporary tenants or the frequent change of tenants created tax collection problems and increased foul play against taxpayers, the Ottoman state established the malikâne system, i.e. the system of lifelong tenants of certain tax districts. This is precisely where the political structure of the Chora Metsovou converges with the tax system of the Ottoman Empire. Its Voivodes, meaning the Ottoman officials who were assigned the supervision of a mukataa, are mentioned in local sources also as ""malikiane saibides or zaebides"", which attests to the fact that their tenure on Chora Metsovou was lifelong and its purpose was to observe and apply the orders of the Sultan’s firmans regarding Metsovo."
"The territory of the former Alsace-Lorraine, legally known as Alsace-Moselle, is a region in the eastern part of France, bordering with Germany. Its principal cities are Metz and Strasbourg. Alsace-Moselle was part of the German Empire from 1871 to 1918, and was subsequently reoccupied by Germany from 1940 until its recapture by the Allies at the end of World War II. Consisting of the two departments that make up the region of Alsace, which are Haut-Rhin and Bas-Rhin, and the department of Moselle, which is the northeastern part of Lorraine, there are historical reasons for the continuance of local law in Alsace-Moselle. Alsace-Moselle maintains its own local legislation, applying specific customs and laws on certain issues in spite of its being an integral part of France. These laws are principally in areas that France addressed by changing its own law in the period 1871–1919, when Alsace-Moselle was a part of Germany. Alsace-Moselle has many speakers of a form of High German known as Alsatian, an Alemannic dialect of Upper German. Its native speakers are mostly in Alsace. Several Franconian dialects of West Middle German are also spoken in the district of Moselle, although their number of native speakers has dwindled significantly since the Second World War and the French language is now overwhelmingly heard in these districts. The region's German-language past is now, at the beginning of the 21st century, mostly evident in the names of towns, streets, villages and rivers. Protestantism is widespread in Alsace, while there are comparatively few Protestants in most other parts of France."

A carafe, which is also traditionally used for serving alcoholic beverages, is similar in design to a decanter but is not supplied with a stopper."
"The International Wine & Spirit Competition is an annual wine and spirit competition founded in 1969 by the German/British oenologist . Each year the competition receives entries from over 90 countries worldwide. The awards given by the competition are considered as high honors in the industry. The event occurs annually in November, in London. Only products which pay the entry fee of £140 per category are judged, and three/four bottles of each product must be supplied. Depending on the points out of 100 awarded, submitted products can receive gold outstanding, gold, silver outstanding, silver, or bronze awards, and there are no limitations on how many of each which can be awarded. There is also an extensive range of trophies each year."
"In viticulture, the yield is a measure of the amount of grapes or wine that is produced per unit surface of vineyard, and is therefore a type of crop yield. Two different types of yield measures are commonly used, mass of grapes per vineyard surface, or volume of wine per vineyard surface. The yield is often seen as a quality factor, with lower yields associated with wines with more concentrated flavours, and the maximum allowed yield is therefore regulated for many wine appellations."
"Wine on Tap is a for wine. Instead of distributing via the bottle, wine is housed in stainless steel kegs or disposable one-way kegs. After the barreling stage, the wine is transferred into the kegs holding about 27 bottles of wine each (or 130 glasses) depending on the size of the keg (10 liters). It is pushed out of the keg by gases such as nitrogen, argon or in case keykeg with compressed air, gas further providing a blanket over the wine and protecting it from oxidation. This is not necessary with keykeg. Recent changes in the wine industry made it possible to tap wine from keykeg by a compressor or handpump. This means that no nitrogen or argon is needed. Wine on tap utilizes cost savings at all levels, from the manufacturer, retailer, and consumer. Traditionally, wine retailers have served wine by the glass by opening and resealing individual bottles. With wine on tap, bottle, cork, and carton costs are eliminated. Costs of waste from throwing away oxidized wine are also decreased and fresher unoxidized wine is delivered to the consumer. Transport costs are significantly reduced as well, as the same amount of wine weighs significantly more in bottles than in a keg. Further, the disposable one way kegs require even less transportation than steel kegs because they are disposable and recyclable. The aging process does not occur in the keg when the wine is blanketed with a gas such as nitrogen or argon to pressurize the keg. Wines not in need of significant aging times are best placed to be housed in kegs."
"Campden tablets (potassium or sodium metabisulfite) are a sulfur-based product that is used primarily to sterilize wine, cider and in beer making to kill bacteria and to inhibit the growth of most wild yeast: this product is also used to eliminate both free chlorine and the more stable form, chloramine, from water solutions (e.g., drinking water from municipal sources). Campden tablets allow the amateur brewer to easily measure small quantities of sodium metabisulfite, so it can be used to protect against wild yeast and bacteria without affecting flavour. Untreated cider must frequently suffers from acetobacter contamination causing vinegar spoilage. Yeasts are resistant to the tablets but the acetobacter are easily killed off, hence treatment is important in cider production. Typical use is one crushed Campden tablet per US gallon (3.8 L) of must or wort. This dosage contributes 67 ppm sulfur dioxide to the wort but the level of active sulfur dioxide diminishes rapidly as it reacts with chlorine and chloramine, and with aldehydes (particularly in wine). Therefore, the concentration of free sulfur dioxide is greatly diminished by the time the beer or wine is consumed. However, when used only for the purpose of dechlorinating tap water before brewing, one tablet will effectively treat 20 US gallons (75 L) of water. Campden tablets are also used as an anti-oxidizing agent when transferring wine between containers. The sodium metabisulfite in the Campden tablets will trap oxygen that enters the wine, preventing it from doing any harm. It is a common misconception that Campden tablets can be used to halt the ferment process in wine before all the available sugars are converted by the yeast, hence controlling the amount of residual sweetness in the final product. This however is not true. In order to halt fermentation, enough Campden tablets would have to be added to render the wine undrinkable. Alternatively, when used in conjunction with potassium sorbate, the yeast population will be greatly reduced and prevented from reproducing. Without the addition of potassium sorbate the yeast population will only be stunned and eventually repopulate if provided with enough fermentable sugars. Campden tablets typically contain 0.44 g each of sodium metabisulfite (plus filler) and 8 of these are equivalent to one half level teaspoon (2.5 mL) of sodium metabisulfite. Other Campden tablet formulations use potassium metabisulfite. Each is also referred to interchangeably as—sulfites, and the 'bi' can be found as 'di'. In terms of usage, sodium thiosulfate is a closely related compound. The name Campden tablet comes from the town of Chipping Campden in Gloucestershire, England, where the original solution was developed in the 1920s by the Fruit and Vegetable Preserving Research Station - now Campden BRI. The idea was then taken up by the Boots Co., who developed the tablet. Campden tablets are also useful in decontamination and neutralization after exposure to tear gas. The molar mass (commonly called molecular weight or MW) of potassium metabisulfite is 222 g/mol, while the molecular weight of sodium metabisulfite is 190 g/mol."
"Must weight is a measure of the amount of sugar in grape juice (must) and, hence, indicates the amount of alcohol that could be produced if it is all fermented to alcohol, rather than left as residual sugar. While must weight is a commonly used term among wine makers, the physically correct term would be must density. In Germany, Luxemburg and Switzerland it is measured in degrees Oechsle (°Oe) and is an important part of the German wine classification. In Italy, France, and Canada the measurement is in degrees Brix, and in the United States it is measured as specific gravity (although Brix is sometimes used). In Austria the Klosterneuburger Mostwaage (KMW) scale is used. The scale is divided into Klosterneuburger Zuckergrade (°KMW). However, the KMW measures the exact sugar content of the must. The Baumé scale is occasionally used in France and by U.S. brewers. In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, must weight is measured in degrees Normalizovaný moštoměr (°NM). In France and many other countries, the grape must density is often recalculated to show potential alcohol, the per cent alcohol content that would be the result if the must were fermented to a completely dry wine."
"Racking, often referred to as Soutirage or Soutirage traditionnel (meaning racking in French), also filtering or fining, is the process of moving wine or beer from one container to another using gravity rather than a pump, which can be disruptive to the beverage. The process is also known as Abstich in German and travaso in Italian. Alexis Lichine's Encyclopedia of Wines and Spirits defines racking as ""siphoning wine or beer off the lees (in the case of wine) or trub (in the case of beer), into a new, clean barrel or other vessel"". Racking allows clarification and aids in stabilization. Wine that is allowed to age on the lees often develops ""off-tastes"". A racking hose or tube is used and can be attached to a racking cane to make the task easier. The racking process is repeated several times during the aging of wine."
"A corkscrew is a tool for drawing corks from wine bottles and other household bottles that may be sealed with corks. In its traditional form, a corkscrew simply consists of a pointed metallic helix (often called the ""worm"") attached to a handle, which the user screws into the cork and pulls to extract it. Corkscrews are necessary because corks themselves, being small and smooth, are difficult to grip and remove, particularly when inserted fully into an inflexible glass bottle. More recent styles of corkscrew incorporate various systems of levers that further increase the amount of force that can be applied outwards upon the cork, making easier the extraction of difficult corks."
"Xylophilus is a species of proteobacteria, which causes plant disease. It is available from the in the United Kingdom for legitimate researchers and plant disease diagnosticians working in premises licensed to hold it. The genus Xylophilus currently comprises only the species X. ampelinus, which affects grapevines."
"Xylophilus ampelinus (syn. Xanthomonas ampelina and Erwinia vitivora) is a species of proteobacteria, many of which cause plant diseases. It is available from the in the United Kingdom and other international culture collections such as ICMP in New Zealand, and LMG in Belgium. Xylophilus ampelinus was known as Xanthomonas ampelina until it was renamed in 1969 by C.G. Panagopoulos. The type strain was isolated on 5 March 1966 by C.G. Panagopoulos from grape vine (Vitis vinifera var. Sultana) in Greece and was deposited into the NCPPB in 1968 from where it has been distributed to other culture collections for research and diagnostic reference material. Published references to the organism currently include ""Panagopoulos, C.G. 1969. Annls. Inst. Phytopath. Benaki. N.S. 9: 59"". Xylophilus ampelinus is a rod-shaped bacterium that is considered slow growing at ambient temperatures of 25 degrees Celsius. It is gram negative and develops round, yellow colonies when grown on nutrient agar and after extended growth, becomes filamentous. The bacterium is catalase positive, Kovacs negative, urease positive, produced [[H2S]] from cysteine, and did not produce acid from any carbohydrate media."
"The Tallahassee Wine and Food Festival is an annual two-day charitable event held in November in Tallahassee, Florida, United States which began in 1995."
"In viticulture, there are several levels of regional climates that are used to describe the terroir or immutable characteristics of an area. These levels can be as broad as a macroclimate which includes entire wine regions or as small as a microclimate which includes the unique environment around an individual grapevine. In the middle is the mesoclimate which usually describes the characteristics of a particular vineyard site."
"Oz and James's Big Wine Adventure is a BBC television programme of which two series have been broadcast. It was presented by wine expert Oz Clarke and motoring journalist James May (at the time, a presenter of Top Gear), with Clarke aiming to educate May (a committed bitter drinker) about wine while undertaking a road trip. The first season focused on France and the second on California. The sequel series Oz and James Drink to Britain, broadcast in 2009, made the change to a focus on the variety of beverages available in the United Kingdom."
"Gran Reserva. El origen is a Spanish drama television series, working as a prequel to Gran Reserva. Produced by Televisión Española in collaboration with Bambú Producciones, it aired from May 2013 to August 2013. It focuses on the events happening four decades before the original series."
"Caminos de Guanajuato is a Mexican telenovela produced by Javier Pons for TV Azteca. It is based on the Spanish soap opera Gran Reserva produced in 2010. Iliana Fox and Erik Hayser star as the main protagonists, while Alejandra Lazcano and Alberto Guerra as the main antagonists."
"Gran Reserva is a Spanish drama television series, starring Emilio Gutiérrez Caba, Ángela Molina, Tristán Ulloa and Paula Echevarría, among others. Created by Ramón Campos and Gema R. Neira and produced by Bambú Producciones for TVE, the 42 episodes of the series aired on La 1 from 2010 to 2013. Charged with melodrama and thriller, the plot follows the conflict and intrigues between two winemaking families, the Cortázar and the Reverte, in the region of La Rioja."
"Allahabadi Surkha are a variety of guava having deep pink color inside instead of the typical white color and an apple red exterior skin. This fruit is sweet, and strongly flavoured with few seeds and is slightly depressed at both ends. The plants are vigorous, dome shaped and compact. These guavas are cultivated across the Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh region in the northern belt of India. Allahabadi Surkha is cultivated today on almost 1000 hectares of land mainly under Kaushambi and Kaurihar -II districts of Allahabad. The fruit is known for its medical properties such that during the winter season because it neutralizes disease symptoms."
"Governo is a winemaking technique reportedly invented in Tuscany in the 14th century to help complete fermentation and stabilize the wine. The technique involves saving a batch of harvested grapes and allowing them to partially dry. If fermentation of the main batch starts to slow or appears to be nearing stuck fermentation, the half dried grapes are added to the must which then gives the yeast cells a new source of sugar to enliven the batch. From there, the must can be fermented dry or stopped with the wine having a higher level of residual sugar. The process was widely used in the Chianti zones until the advent of temperature controlled fermentation tanks. From Tuscany the technique spread to Marche and Umbria where it is sometimes used today. In the Marche the technique is most often used on wines made from the Verdicchio grape to counteract the grape's natural bitterness and to add some sweetness and frizzante qualities."
"Carbonic maceration is a winemaking technique, often associated with the French wine region of Beaujolais, in which whole grapes are fermented in a carbon dioxide rich environment before crushing. Conventional alcoholic fermentation involves crushing the grapes to free the juice and pulp from the skin with yeast serving to convert sugar into ethanol. Carbonic maceration ferments most of the juice while it is still inside the grape, although grapes at the bottom of the vessel are crushed by gravity and undergo conventional fermentation. The resulting wine is fruity with very low tannins. It is ready to drink quickly but lacks the structure for long-term aging. In extreme cases such as Beaujolais nouveau, the period between picking and bottling can be less than six weeks. During carbonic maceration, an anaerobic environment is created by pumping carbon dioxide into a sealed container filled with whole grape clusters. The carbon dioxide gas permeates through the grape skins and begins to stimulate fermentation at an intracellular level. The entire process takes place inside each intact berry. Ethanol is produced as a by-product of this process but studies have shown that other unique chemical reactions take place that have a distinctive effect on the wine."
Flash release (FR) is a technique used in wine pressing. The technique allows for a better extraction of phenolic compounds and wine polysaccharides. The treatment consists of heating the grapes at 95 °C (203 °F) for several minutes with vapour and then submitting them to a strong vacuum. The technique can be applied to other type of juice extraction.
"Bottle variation is the degree to which different bottles, nominally of the same product, can have different taste, smell, etc. There are many possible causes of bottle variation: 
* variation in the contents prior to packaging 
* variation in the packaging components 
* variation in the product and packaging processes 
* variation in storage, distribution, cold chain, etc. 
* variation in the quantity of contents"
"Precision viticulture is precision farming applied to optimize vineyard performance, in particular maximizing grape yield and quality while minimizing environmental impacts and risk. This is accomplished by measuring local variation in factors that influence grape yield and quality (soil, topography, microclimate, vine health, etc.) and applying appropriate viticulture management practices (trellis design, pruning, fertilizer application, irrigation, timing of harvest, etc.). Precision viticulture is based on the premise that high in-field variability for factors that affect vine growth and grape ripening warrants intensive management customized according to local conditions. Precision viticulture depends on new and emerging technologies such as global positioning systems (GPS), meteorologic and other environmental sensors, satellite and airborne remote sensing, and geographic information systems (GIS) to assess and respond to variability."
"CellarTracker is a website that stores information about wines and wine collections. Created in 2003 by Eric LeVine, a former Microsoft program manager, CellarTracker has grown to be one of the world's most comprehensive . CellarTracker is free to use and relies heavily on its users for data input, constantly increasing the number of tracked bottles as well as user tasting notes.

"Zymology, also known as zymurgy (from the Greek: ζύμωσις+ἔργον, ""the workings of fermentation"") is an applied science which studies the biochemical process of fermentation and its practical uses. Common topics include the selection of fermenting yeast and bacteria species and their use in brewing, wine making, fermenting milk, and the making of other fermented foods."
"Comet vintages are years during which an astronomical event, involving generally a ""Great Comet"", occurs prior to harvest. Throughout the history of wine, winemakers have attributed successful vintages and ideal weather conditions to the unexplained effects caused by the comets. Some of the most heralded vintages in the last couple of centuries—such as the 1811, 1826, 1839, 1845, 1852, 1858, 1861, 1985, and 1989 vintages—have coincided with a notable appearance of a comet. There is no scientific basis for any effect of comets on viticulture, but the term nevertheless remains in use. The term ""comet wine"" is sometimes used in the wine world to describe a wine of exceptional quality in reference to the high reputation that comet vintages have. The 1811 comet vintage, coinciding with the appearance of the Great Comet of 1811, is perhaps the most famous. The 1811 Château d'Yquem has exhibited what wine experts like Robert Parker have described as exceptional longevity with Parker scoring the wine a perfect 100 points when tasted in 1996. The 1811 vintage of Veuve Clicquot is theorized to have been the first truly ""modern"" Champagne due to the advancements in the méthode champenoise which Veuve Clicquot pioneered through the technique of remuage."
"The Peace of Ryswick, or Rijswijk, was a series of treaties signed in the Dutch city of Rijswijk between 20 September and 30 October 1697. They ended the 1688 to 1697 Nine Years' War between France, and the Grand Alliance, which included England, Spain, Austria, and the Dutch Republic. One of a series of wars fought by Louis XIV of France between 1666 to 1714, neither side was able to make significant territorial gains. By 1695, the huge financial costs, coupled with widespread famine and economic dislocation, meant both sides needed peace. Negotiations were delayed by the question of who would inherit the Spanish Empire from the childless and terminally-ill Charles II of Spain, the closest heirs being Louis and Leopold. Since Louis could not impose his preferred solution, he refused to discuss the issue, while Leopold refused to sign without its inclusion. He finally did so with great reluctance on 30 October 1697, but the Peace was generally viewed as a truce; Charles' death in 1701 led to the War of the Spanish Succession. In Europe and North America, the terms essentially restored the position prevailing before the war, while Spain ceded the islands of Tortuga and Saint-Domingue. France also evacuated territories occupied since the 1679 Treaty of Nijmegen, including Freiburg, Breisach and the Duchy of Lorraine."
"The County of Dagsburg with its capital Dagsburg (now Dabo in France) existed in Lorraine from 11th to 18th centuries when the area was still part of Holy Roman Empire. The ancestral castle in Dabo, the in Lorraine, was acquired by the Etichonids shortly before the year 1000 through the marriage of Hugo VI, Count of and of Eguisheim, with Heilwig of Dagsburg (d. 1046). The Etichonids built another in Upper Alsace in 1150. The male members of the family used the title of Count of Dagsburg and Count of Eguisheim at this time; later they added the County of Metz. Among their possessions were numerous manors in the upper Saar area, Moha and Waleffe and High justice in the Diocese of Metz. The Etichonids died out in 1225. Gertrude of Dagsburg, the last member of the family, left behind eleven castles (including the Château de Guirbaden) and the vogtei over nine monasteries. The possessions around Dabo fell to the House of Leiningen in 1241. Another part of the inheritance went to the House of Zähringen, who at times left some of their rights to the archbishopric of Strasbourg, with whom they had territorial disputes. The Bishop of Metz decided that the fiefs of Moha and Waleffe had fallen vacant, and gave them to the Prince-Bishop of Liège. A branch called Dagsburg-Leiningen existed within the House of Leiningen from 1317 to 1797."
"The County of Ferrette (or Pfirt) was a feudal jurisdiction in Alsace in the Middle Ages and the early modern period. It roughly corresponds with the Sundgau and comprised the lordships of Ferrette (Pfirt), Altkirch, Thann, Belfort, Rougemont and others. These territories were not contiguous, but formed a patchwork of jurisdictions under the Holy Roman Empire. The County of Ferrette emerged in the twelfth century alongside the County of Montbéliard as a division of the pagus of Elsgau, traditionally regarded as the southernmost pagus of Alsace. This was a Francophone region. In the late Middle Ages, the County of Ferrette was the most westerly Habsburg possession and a part of Further Austria. It bordered the French Duchy of Burgundy and all four dukes of the House of Valois who ruled from 1363 until 1477 made efforts to acquire it. It was the object of a complicated series of marriage negotiations under the first duke, Philip the Bold. In 1387, Duke Leopold IV of Austria married Catherine, daughter of Philip the Bold, fulfilling an agreement first reached in 1378. For her dower she received some rents in the county and finally in 1403 the entire county, whose officers paid homage to her on 6 February 1404. When Leopold died childless in 1411, he was succeeded by his brother, Frederick IV, who seized the county of Ferrette, leaving Catherine only two castles, one of which was Belfort. Catherine, however, claimed the whole county belonged to her. Her brother, Duke John the Fearless, garrisoned the castles on her behalf. These garrisons were small. To Belfort he sent only a castellan, nine squires, a cannoneer and some valets. The dispute over Ferrette continued into the reign of John's son, Philip the Good. In 1420, he made an agreement with Catherine whereby he gave her an annual pension of 3,000 francs and promised to help recover the county in return for being named as her heir. Philip opened negotiations with Frederick, even threatening war in 1422–23, but made no progress. There were hostilities between Catherine's men and the Habsburgs' in those same years, but Frederick even managed to take back Belfort. Catherine died childless in 1425, but the Burgundian claim was not immediately or permanently dropped. In 1427, a conference was held at Montbéliard whereat Amadeus VIII, Duke of Savoy, mediated the dispute. A treaty between the Archduke of Austria and the Duke of Burgundy seems to have been signed in mid-1428. Nevertheless, Ferrette, because it lay on the common border between the two houses, was as at the centre of the fighting in the brief . During the war, Philip's men successfully captured Belfort in a night attack. A truce was signed in October 1431 and a peace treaty in May 1432. In 1434, Philip bought up the claim of Catherine's sister, Margaret, to the county of Ferrette. On 9 May 1469, by the Treaty of Saint-Omer, Archduke Sigismund of Austria mortgaged the County of Ferrette along with the Landgraviate of Upper Alsace to Duke Charles of Burgundy to secure a loan of 50,000 florins. By the terms of the loan, the principal as well as Charles's administrative expenses had to be repaid in a single lump sum, making it unlikely that the Habsburgs would ever discharge it. Charles's own power, however, was limited by the fact that many of the rights of the counts had been pawned by the Habsburgs. Ferrette itself, for example, was in pawn for 7,000 florins."
"The Zabern or Saverne Affair was a crisis of domestic policy which occurred in the German Empire at the end of 1913. It was caused by political unrest in Zabern (now Saverne) in Alsace-Lorraine, where two battalions of the Prussian were garrisoned, after a second-lieutenant insulted the Alsatian population. The military reacted to the protests with arbitrary illegal acts. These infringements led to a debate in the German Reichstag about the militaristic structures of German society, as well as the position of the leadership of the Empire in relationship to Kaiser Wilhelm II. The affair not only put a severe strain on the relationship between the imperial state of Alsace-Lorraine and the remainder of the German Empire, but also led to a considerable loss of prestige of the Kaiser."
"Henri Jules Zirnheld (9 November 1876 – 18 December 1940) was a French trade union leader. Born in the Alsace, Zirnheld studied at the Christian Brothers' school in Saint-Thomas-d'Aquin, Paris, then became an accountant. He was enthusiastic about Catholic social works, and in 1892, he joined the Trade and Industry Employees' Union (SECI), a union of Catholic workers. In 1896, he attended a Christian workers' congress in Reims, and this inspired him to become more involved in the union, editing its journal. Zirnheld completed his military service in 1898/99, and then won election to his union's executive. In 1900, he passed an exam which secured him work at the Bank of France. He remained active in SECI, and attended the first international congress of Christian workers, in Paris. In 1902, the General Confederation of Labour (CGT), had SECI expelled from the Paris Trades Council. Zirnheld began speaking out against the CGT, and socialism more generally. In 1903, he defeated CGT efforts to exclude his union from the International Employees Congress. In 1906, he was elected as the union's president. As leader of SECI, Zirnheld tried to maintain a course independent of both the Catholic religious hierarchy, and the secular trade union movement. He was elected to the national industrial tribunal in 1911, and in 1913 he was the founder of the French Federation of Catholic Employees' Unions. Zirnheld served in the French Army during World War I, but was taken as a prisoner of war in 1916. He tried to smuggle information on the German military back into France, but he was informed upon, and was sentenced to 12 years hard labour. Three months later, the war ended, and he returned home. Back in France, Zirnheld led the move to form the French Confederation of Christian Workers (CFTC), becoming its first president, although against his objections, it admitted all Christians, not just Catholics. He chaired the conference which agreed to found the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (IFCTU), and when it was set up, in 1920, he became vice president. He opposed the general strikes in France, led by the CGT. In 1933, with the IFCTU declining, Zirnheld was elected as its joint president, becoming sole president in 1937. That year, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the . But from 1938, he began suffering with poor health. The CFTC was dissolved, along with the CGT, in 1940, and Zirnheld signed the Manifesto of the Twelve along with CGT leaders, in protest, but he died before the end of the year."
"Jean-François Géorgel (29 January 1731 in Bruyères (Alsace region) – 1813 in the same city) was a French clergyman, abbot and member of the Society of Jesus. He is particularly known for the six volumes of his memoirs of the French Revolution entitled Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire des événements de la fin du dix-huitième siècle. He also wrote a Voyage de St Pétersbourg en 1800. Both works were published by his nephew in 1818."
"A Spritz (Austrian German: Spritzer, ""splash"" / ""sparkling"") is an Italian wine-based cocktail, commonly served as an aperitif in Northeast Italy. It consists of prosecco, digestive bitters and soda water. Spritz Veneziano al Select, Spritz al Campari and Aperol Spritz are popular versions of the Italian wine-based cocktail, each one using a different bitters (namely Select, Campari and Aperol). Since 2011 Spritz is an IBA official cocktail, initially listed as “Spritz Veneziano” then simply as “Spritz”. The Spritz became widely popular outside of Italy around 2018 and Aperol Spritz was ranked as the world's 9th bestselling cocktail in 2019 by the website Drinks International."
"Patola is a double ikat woven sari, usually made from silk, made in Patan, Gujarat, India. The word patola is the plural form; the singular is patolu. They are very expensive, once worn only by those belonging to royal and aristocratic families. These saris are popular among those who can afford the high prices. Velvet patola styles are also made in Surat. Patola-weaving is a closely guarded family tradition. There are three families in Patan that weave these highly prized double ikat saris. It is said that this technique is taught to no one in the family, but only to the sons. It can take six months to one year to make one sari due to the long process of dying each strand separately before weaving them together. Patola was woven in Surat, Ahmedabad and Patan. Highly valued in Indonesia, became part of the local weaving tradition there."
"Pochampally sari or Pochampally ikat is a saree made in Bhoodan Pochampally, Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district, Telangana State, India. They have traditional geometric patterns in Ikat style of dyeing. The intricate geometric designs find their way into sarees and dress materials. The Indian government's official airplane company, Air India, has its cabin crew wear specially designed Pochampally silk sarees."
"Wine-dark sea is a traditional English translation of oînops póntos (οἶνοψ πόντος, IPA: /ôi̯.nops pón.tos/), from oînos (οἶνος, ""wine"") + óps (ὄψ, ""eye; face""). It is an epithet in Homer of uncertain meaning: a literal translation is ""wine-face sea"" (wine-faced, wine-eyed). It is attested five times in the Iliad and twelve times in the Odyssey, often to describe rough, stormy sea. The only other use of oînops in the works of Homer is for oxen (once in both his epic poems), where it seems to describe a reddish color, which has given rise to various speculations about what it could mean about either the state of Aegean Sea during antiquity or the color perception of Ancient Greeks."
"Wine has been produced for thousands of years, with evidence of ancient wine production in Georgia from c. 6000 BC (the earliest known traces of wine), Iran from c. 5000 BC, Armenia from c. 4100 BC (large-scale production), and Sicily from c. 4000 BC.The earliest evidence of a grape and rice mixed based fermented drink sometimes compared to wine was found in ancient China (c. 7000 BC). The altered consciousness produced by wine has been considered religious since its origin. The ancient Greeks worshiped Dionysus or Bacchus and the Ancient Romans carried on his cult. Consumption of ritual wine, probably a certain type of sweet wine originally, was part of Jewish practice since Biblical times and, as part of the eucharist commemorating Jesus's Last Supper, became even more essential to the Christian Church. Although Islam nominally forbade the production or consumption of wine, during its Golden Age, alchemists such as Geber pioneered wine's distillation for medicinal and industrial purposes such as the production of perfume. Wine production and consumption increased, burgeoning from the 15th century onwards as part of European expansion. Despite the devastating 1887 phylloxera louse infestation, modern science and technology adapted and industrial wine production and wine consumption now occur throughout the world."
"Ancient Rome played a pivotal role in the history of wine. The earliest influences on the viticulture of the Italian peninsula can be traced to ancient Greeks and the Etruscans. The rise of the Roman Empire saw both technological advances in and burgeoning awareness of winemaking, which spread to all parts of the empire. Rome's influence has had a profound effect on the histories of today's major winemaking regions in France, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain. The Roman belief that wine was a daily necessity made the drink ""democratic"" and ubiquitous; in various forms, it was available to slaves, peasants and aristocrats, men and women alike. To ensure the steady supply of wine to Roman soldiers and colonists, viticulture and wine production spread to every part of the empire. The economic opportunities presented by trading in wine drew merchants to do business with tribes native to Gaul and Germania, bringing Roman influences to these regions even before the arrival of the Roman military. Evidence of this trade and the far-reaching ancient wine economy is most often found through amphorae - ceramic jars used to transport wine. The works of Roman writers—most notably Cato, Columella, Horace, Catullus, Palladius, Pliny, Varro and Virgil—have provided insight into the role played by wine in Roman culture as well as contemporary understanding of winemaking and viticultural practices. Many of the techniques and principles first developed in ancient Roman times can be found in modern winemaking."
"Wine fraud relates to the commercial aspects of wine. The most prevalent type of fraud is one where wines are adulterated, usually with the addition of cheaper products (e.g. juices) and sometimes with harmful chemicals and sweeteners (compensating for color or flavor). Counterfeiting and the relabelling of inferior and cheaper wines to more expensive brands is another common type of wine fraud. A third category of wine fraud relates to the investment wine industry. An example of this is when wines are offered to investors at excessively high prices by a company who then go into planned liquidation. In some cases the wine is never bought for the investor. Losses in the UK have been high, prompting the Department of Trade and Industry and Police to act. In the US, investors have been duped by fraudulent investment wine firms. Independent guidelines to potential wine investors are now available. In wine production, as wine is technically defined as fermented grape juice, the term ""wine fraud"" can be used to describe the adulteration of wine by substances that are not related to grapes. In the retailing of wine, as wine is comparable with any other commodity, the term ""wine fraud"" can be used to describe the mis-selling of wine (either as an investment or in its deceitful misrepresentation) in general. Fraud in wine production refers to the use of additives in order to deceive. This may include coloring agents such as elderberry juice, and flavorings such as cinnamon at best, or less desirable additives at worst. Some varieties of wine have sought after characteristics. For example some wines have a deep, dark color and flavor notes of spices due to the presence of various phenolic compounds found in the skin of the grapes. Fraudsters will use additives to artificially create these characteristics when they are lacking. Fraud in the selling of wine has seen much attention focused on label fraud and the investment wine market. Counterfeit labelling of rare, expensive, and cult wines, and unregulated investment wine firms characterise this type of fraud. Wine Spectator noted as much as 5% of the wine sold in secondary markets could be counterfeit and the DTI (UK) believes losses by investors to rogue wine investment firms amount to hundreds of millions of pounds."
"Cork taint is a broad term referring to a wine fault characterized by a set of undesirable smells or tastes found in a bottle of wine, especially spoilage that can only be detected after bottling, aging and opening. Though modern studies have shown that other factors can also be responsible for taint – including wooden barrels, storage conditions and the transport of corks and wine – the cork stopper is normally considered to be responsible, and a wine found to be tainted on opening is said to be corked or ""corky"". Cork taint can affect wines irrespective of price and quality level. The chief cause of cork taint is the presence of the chemical compounds 2,4,6-trichloroanisole (TCA) or 2,4,6-tribromoanisole (TBA) in the wine, which in many cases will have been transferred from the cork, but which also can have been transferred through the cork rather than from it. TCA is a compound which does not occur naturally. It is created when some fungi are treated with chlorinated phenolic compounds, which are a type of antimicrobial agent used in the processing of wood. This compound is one of the chief factors responsible for the problem associated with mold liable to be found in cork. Very small amounts of this compound, on the order of nanograms, can be responsible for this defect. Corked wine containing TCA has a characteristic odor, variously described as resembling a moldy newspaper, wet dog, damp cloth, or damp basement. In almost all cases of corked wine the wine's native aromas are reduced significantly, and a very tainted wine is quite unpalatable, although harmless. While the human threshold for detecting TCA is measured in the single-digit parts per trillion, this can vary by several orders of magnitude depending on an individual's sensitivity. Detection is also complicated by the olfactory system's particularly quick habituation to TCA, making the smell less obvious on each subsequent sniff."
"Tannins (or tannoids) are a class of astringent, polyphenolic biomolecules that bind to and precipitate proteins and various other organic compounds including amino acids and alkaloids. The term tannin (from Anglo-Norman tanner, from Medieval Latin tannāre, from tannum, oak bark) refers to the use of oak and other bark in tanning animal hides into leather. By extension, the term tannin is widely applied to any large polyphenolic compound containing sufficient hydroxyls and other suitable groups (such as carboxyls) to form strong complexes with various macromolecules. The tannin compounds are widely distributed in many species of plants, where they play a role in protection from predation (including as pesticides) and might help in regulating plant growth. The astringency from the tannins is what causes the dry and puckery feeling in the mouth following the consumption of unripened fruit, red wine or tea. Likewise, the destruction or modification of tannins with time plays an important role when determining harvesting times. Tannins have molecular weights ranging from 500 to over 3,000 (gallic acid esters) and up to 20,000 Daltons (proanthocyanidins)."
"Enotourism, oenotourism, wine tourism, or vinitourism refers to tourism whose purpose is or includes the tasting, consumption or purchase of wine, often at or near the source. Where other types of tourism are often passive in nature, enotourism can consist of visits to wineries, tasting wines, vineyard walks, or even taking an active part in the harvest."
"Wine tasting is the sensory examination and evaluation of wine. While the practice of wine tasting is as ancient as its production, a more formalized methodology has slowly become established from the 14th century onwards. Modern, professional wine tasters (such as sommeliers or buyers for retailers) use a constantly evolving specialized terminology which is used to describe the range of perceived flavors, aromas and general characteristics of a wine. More informal, recreational tasting may use similar terminology, usually involving a much less analytical process for a more general, personal appreciation. Results that have surfaced through scientific blind wine tasting suggest the unreliability of wine tasting in both experts and consumers, such as inconsistency in identifying wines based on region and price."
"Clementine Edle von Schuch-Proska, née Procházka, (12 February 1850 – 8 June 1932) was an Austrian operatic coloratura soprano, who became an audience favourite and an honorary member of the Dresden Court Opera as Kammersängerin."

"The early history of the South African wine industry (also known as New World wine) can be traced to the founding of a supply station at the Cape of Good Hope by the Dutch East India Company. Jan van Riebeeck was given the task of managing the station and planting vineyards to produce wine and grapes in the Wijnberg (Wine mountain Area); that could be used to ward off scurvy for sailors continuing on their voyages along the spice route. In 1685, another Cape Governor, Simon van der Stel, purchased a large 750-hectare (1,900-acre) estate, founding what later became the world-renowned Constantia wine estate. In the 19th century, South Africa fell under British rule which proved lucrative for the wine industry as South African wine flowed into the British market. This prosperity lasted until the 1860s when the Cobden–Chevalier Treaty signed by the Palmerston government and France reduced the preferential tariffs that benefited South African wine in favor of French wine exports. Following the devastation from the phylloxera epidemic in the late 19th century, many vineyards were replanted with high yielding grape varieties such as Cinsaut. By the early 1900s there was a large glut of wine, creating a wine lake effect which led some producers to pour their unsaleable wine into local rivers and streams. The depressed prices caused by this out-of-balance supply and demand dynamic prompted the South African government to fund the formation of the Koöperatieve Wijnbouwers Vereniging van Zuid-Afrika Bpkt (KWV) in 1918. Initially started as a co-operative, the KWV soon grew in power and prominence, setting policies and prices for the entire South African wine industry. To deal with the wine glut the KWV restricted yields and set minimum prices, encouraging the production of brandy and fortified wines. For much of the 20th century, the wine industry of South Africa received very little attention on the worldwide stage. Its isolation was further deepened by boycotts of South African products in protest at the country's system of Apartheid. It wasn't until the late 1980s and 1990s when Apartheid was ended and the world's export market opened up that South African wines began to experience a renaissance. With a steep learning curve, many producers in South Africa quickly adopted new viticultural and winemaking technologies. The presence of from abroad brought international influences and focus on well known varieties such as Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay. The reorganization of the powerful KWV co-operative into a private business further sparked innovation and improvement in quality. Vineyard owners had previously relied on KWV's price-fixing structure, that bought their excess grapes for distillation. Now they had to shift their focus to quality wine production in order to compete. In 1990, less than 30% of all the grapes harvested were used for wine aimed at the consumer market, with the remaining 70% being discarded, distilled into brandy or sold as table grapes and juice. By 2003 these proportions had reversed, with more than 70% of the grapes harvested that year reaching the consumer market as wine."
"The Department of Viticulture and Enology at the University of California, Davis, located in Davis, California, offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in the areas of grape growing and wine making. Located just 45 minutes from Napa Wine Country the department has strong connections with wine producers in California and elsewhere. The department has produced many of the notable winemakers of the California wine industry."
"The traditional method is the process used in the Champagne region of France to produce Champagne. It is also the method used in various French regions to produce sparkling wines (not called “Champagne”), in Spain to produce Cava, in Portugal to produce Espumante and in Italy to produce Franciacorta. The method is known as the méthode champenoise, but the Champagne producers have successfully lobbied the European Union to restrict the use of that term within the EU only to wines produced in Champagne. Thus, wines from elsewhere cannot use the term ""méthode champenoise"" on products sold in the EU, and instead the term ""traditional method"" (méthode traditionnelle) or the local language equivalent (método tradicional in Spain and Portugal, metodo classico or metodo tradizionale in Italy, and in Germany klassische Flaschengärung). South African wines from the Western Cape are labelled with the term Methode Cap Classique. Some wine producers in countries outside the EU may disregard EU labeling laws and use méthode champenoise or even “Champagne” on labels for products not exported to the EU, but this usage is decreasing. As the traditional method is both labour and cost intensive, it is only viable for high-end sparkling wines. The Charmat process is often used instead, in the production of cheaper sparkling wines, while other methods exist as well."
"The Revolt of the Languedoc winegrowers was a mass movement in 1907 in Languedoc and the Pyrénées-Orientales of France that was repressed by the government of Georges Clemenceau.It was caused by a serious crisis in winemaking at the start of the 20th century.The movement was also called the ""paupers revolt"" of the Midi.It was marked by the fraternization of the 17th line infantry regiment with the demonstrators in Béziers."
"In the pottery of ancient Greece, a kylix (/ˈkaɪlɪks/ KY-liks, /ˈkɪlɪks/ KIL-iks; Ancient Greek: κύλιξ, pl. κύλικες; also spelled cylix; pl.: kylikes /ˈkaɪlɪˌkiːz/ KY-li-keez, /ˈkɪlɪˌkiːz/ KIL-i-keez) is the most common type of wine-drinking cup. It has a broad, relatively shallow, body raised on a stem from a foot and usually two horizontal handles disposed symmetrically. The main alternative wine-cup shape was the kantharos, with a narrower and deeper cup and high vertical handles. The almost flat interior circle of the base of the cup, called the tondo, was generally the primary surface for painted decoration in the black-figure or red-figure pottery styles of the 6th and 5th century BC, and the outside was also often painted. As the representations would be covered with wine, the scenes would only be revealed in stages as the wine was drained. They were often designed with this in mind, with scenes created so that they would surprise or titillate the drinker as they were revealed. The word comes from the Greek kylix (""cup""), which is cognate with Latin calix, the source of the English word ""chalice"" but not related to the similar Greek word calyx which means ""husk"" or ""pod"". The term seems to have been rather more generally used in ancient Greece. Individual examples and the many named sub-varieties of kylix are often called names just using ""cup"". Like all other types of Greek pottery vessels, they are also covered by the general term of ""vase""."
"A screw cap or closure is a common type of closure for bottles, jars, and tubes."
"A stopper or cork is a cylindrical or conical closure used to seal a container, such as a bottle, tube or barrel. Unlike a lid or bottle cap, which encloses a container from the outside without displacing the inner volume, a bung is partially or wholly inserted inside the container to act as a seal. A bung can be defined as ""a plug or closure used to close an opening in a drum or barrel. It is called a plug when referring to a steel drum closure."" A glass stopper is often called a ""ground glass joint"" (or ""joint taper""), and a cork stopper is called simply a ""cork"". Stoppers used for wine bottles are referred to as ""corks"", even when made from another material. A common every-day example of a stopper is the cork of a wine bottle. When used to seal the bungholes of barrels, the stopper is called a bung. Other bungs, particularly those used in chemical barrels, may be made of metal and be screwed into place via threading."
"Wine corks are a stopper used to seal wine bottles. They are typically made from cork (bark of the cork oak), though synthetic materials can be used. Common alternative wine closures include screw caps and glass stoppers. 68 percent of all cork is produced for wine bottle stoppers. Corks are manufactured for still wines as well as sparkling wines; the latter are bottled under pressure, forcing the corks to take on a mushroom shape. They are fastened with a wire cage known as a muselet."
"The role of yeast in winemaking is the most important element that distinguishes wine from grape juice. In the absence of oxygen, yeast converts the sugars of wine grapes into alcohol and carbon dioxide through the process of fermentation. The more sugars in the grapes, the higher the potential alcohol level of the wine if the yeast are allowed to carry out fermentation to dryness. Sometimes winemakers will stop fermentation early in order to leave some residual sugars and sweetness in the wine such as with dessert wines. This can be achieved by dropping fermentation temperatures to the point where the yeast are inactive, sterile filtering the wine to remove the yeast or fortification with brandy or neutral spirits to kill off the yeast cells. If fermentation is unintentionally stopped, such as when the yeasts become exhausted of available nutrients and the wine has not yet reached dryness, this is considered a stuck fermentation. The most common yeast associated with winemaking is Saccharomyces cerevisiae which has been favored due to its predictable and vigorous fermentation capabilities, tolerance of relatively high levels of alcohol and sulfur dioxide as well as its ability to thrive in normal wine pH between 2.8 and 4. Despite its widespread use which often includes deliberate inoculation from cultured stock, S. cerevisiae is rarely the only yeast species involved in a fermentation. Grapes brought in from harvest are usually teeming with a variety of ""wild yeast"" from the Kloeckera and Candida genera. These yeasts often begin the fermentation process almost as soon as the grapes are picked when the weight of the clusters in the harvest bins begin to crush the grapes, releasing the sugar-rich must. While additions of sulfur dioxide (often added at the crusher) may limit some of the wild yeast activities, these yeasts will usually die out once the alcohol level reaches about 15% due to the toxicity of alcohol on the yeast cells physiology while the more alcohol tolerant Saccharomyces species take over. In addition to S. cerevisiae, Saccharomyces bayanus is a species of yeast that can tolerate alcohol levels of 17–20% and is often used in fortified wine production such as ports and varieties such as Zinfandel and Syrah harvested at high Brix sugar levels. Another common yeast involved in wine production is Brettanomyces whose presence in a wine may be viewed by different winemakers as either a wine fault or in limited quantities as an added note of complexity."
"A winepress is a device used to extract juice from crushed grapes during wine making. There are a number of different styles of presses that are used by wine makers but their overall functionality is the same. Each style of press exerts controlled pressure in order to free the juice from the fruit (most often grapes). The pressure must be controlled, especially with grapes, in order to avoid crushing the seeds and releasing a great deal of undesirable tannins into the wine. Wine was being made at least as long ago as 4000 BC; in 2011, a winepress was unearthed in Armenia with red wine dated 6,000 years old."
"The health effects of wine are mainly determined by its active ingredient alcohol. Some studies found that, when comparing people who consume alcohol, drinking small quantities of alcohol (up to one standard drink per day for women and one to two drinks per day for men) is associated with a decreased risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome and early death. However, other studies found no such effects. Drinking more than the standard drink amount increases the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, stroke and cancer. Mixed results are also observed in light drinking and cancer mortality. Risk is greater in young people due to binge drinking which may result in violence or accidents. About 88,000 deaths in the US are estimated to be due to alcohol each year. Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years and excessive alcohol use is the third leading cause of early death in the United States. According to systematic reviews and medical associations, people who are nondrinkers should not start drinking wine. Wine has a long history of use as an early form of medication, being recommended variously as a safe alternative to drinking water, an antiseptic for treating wounds, a digestive aid, and as a cure for a wide range of ailments including lethargy, diarrhea and pain from child birth. Ancient Egyptian papyri and Sumerian tablets dating back to 2200 BC detail the medicinal role of wine, making it the world's oldest documented human-made medicine. Wine continued to play a major role in medicine until the late 19th and early 20th century, when changing opinions and medical research on alcohol and alcoholism cast doubt on its role as part of a healthy lifestyle."
"Wine (Chinese: 葡萄酒 pútáojiǔ lit. ""grape alcohol"") has a long history in China. Although long overshadowed by huangjiu (sometimes translated as ""yellow wine"") and the much stronger distilled spirit baijiu, wine consumption has grown dramatically since the economic reforms of the 1980s. China is now numbered among the top ten global markets for wine. Ties with French producers are especially strong, and Ningxia wines have received international recognition."
"The history of French wine, spans a period of at least 2600 years dating to the founding of Massalia in the 6th century BC by Phocaeans with the possibility that viticulture existed much earlier. The Romans did much to spread viticulture across the land they knew as Gaul, encouraging the planting of vines in areas that would become the well known wine regions of Bordeaux, Burgundy, Alsace, Champagne, Languedoc, Loire Valley and the Rhone. Over the course of its history, the French wine industry would be influenced and driven by the commercial interests of the lucrative English market and Dutch traders.Prior to the French Revolution, the Catholic Church was one of France's largest vineyard owners-wielding considerable influence in regions such as Champagne and Burgundy where the concept of terroir first took root. Aided by these external and internal influences, the French wine industry has been the pole bearer for the world wine industry for most of its history with many of its wines considered the benchmark for their particular style. The late 20th and early 21st century brought considerable change—earmarked by a changing global market and competition from other European wine regions such as Italy and Spain as well as emerging New World wine producers such as California, Australia and South America."
"Baron Philippe de Rothschild came up with the idea of having each year's Château Mouton Rothschild label designed by a famous artist of the day. In 1946, this became a permanent and significant aspect of the Mouton image with labels created by some of the world's great painters and sculptors. The popularity of the label images results in auction prices for older and more collectible years being far out of sync with the other first growths, whose labels do not change year to year.

"On 14 November 2015, a TGV train derailed in Eckwersheim, Alsace, France, while performing commissioning trials on the second phase of the LGV Est high-speed rail line, which was scheduled to open for commercial service five months later. The derailment resulted in 11 deaths among those aboard, while the 42 others aboard the train were injured. It was the first fatal derailment in the history of the TGV and the third derailment since the TGV entered commercial service in 1981. The test train was traveling eastbound on the southern track when it entered a curve at 265km/h which was 90km/h above its assigned speed—causing the rear bogie of the lead power car to derail to the left (outside of curve) due to centrifugal forces. The lead power car separated from the rest of the train, and the rear of the lead power car struck the concrete parapet on the abutment to a bridge over the Marne–Rhine Canal. The power car slid along the left parapet of the bridge and overturned, sliding down the embankment and coming to a rest 150 m beyond the end of the bridge. Cars 2–7 derailed before the bridge and travelled off the embankment with enough speed to overshoot the canal and come to rest 80-130m beyond the beginning of the bridge. Cars 8–9 came to rest on the east bank of the canal and the rear power car ended up partially submerged in the canal. According to investigators, late braking, which led to the train entering the curve at excessive speed, was the immediate cause of the accident. Criminal and technical investigations are ongoing. French national rail operator SNCF suspended test trials at high speeds until the lessons learned from the investigation were integrated into testing process. The scheduled opening of the second phase of the LGV Est for commercial service was delayed three months, from 3 April 2016 to 3 July 2016."
"The Surat Zari Craft is a textile product of Surat district in Gujarat, India, which is made from yarns of silk and cotton mixed with gold, silver or copper. The zari threads are used to make intricate designs by weaving into generally silk fabrics. Its use is extensive in textile industries and handicrafts. The Surat Zari is either woven on cloth or hand embroidered to form fabric borders or used as part on the body of the cloth. The zaris are used in fabrics made in Varanasi and a few other places in Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Banarasi saris made in Varanasi and Kanjivaram Saris of South India use Surat Zari extensively. The zaris made in Surat are of two types - the real metallic zari made with gold and few pure metals, and the imitation zari is woven with plastics."
"The Kutch Embroidery is a handicraft and textile signature art tradition of the tribal community of Kutch District in Gujarat, India. This embroidery with its rich designs has made a notable contribution to the Indian embroidery traditions. The embroidery, practiced normally by women is generally done on fabrics of cotton, in the form of a net using cotton or silk threads. In certain patterns, it is also crafted over silk and satin. The types of stitches adopted are “square chain, double buttonhole, pattern darning, running stitch, satin and straight stitches”. The signature effect of the colorful embroidery sparkles when small mirrors called abhla are sewn over the geometrically shaped designs. Depending on the tribal sub groups of Rabari, , and involved with this craft work many hand embroidered ethnic styles have evolved. These six styles: Suf, khaarek, paako, Rabari, Garasia Jat, and Mutava. This embroidery product of Kutch has been registered for protection under the List of Geographical indication of the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement. In March 2013, it was listed as ""Kutch Embroidery"" under the GI Act 1999 of the Government of India with registration confirmed by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks under Class 24 Textile and Textile Goods, and its logo registered in November 2015 vide application number 509 for the dated 8 January 2012."

"Bagh print is a traditional Indian handicraft originating in Bagh, Dhar district of Madhya Pradesh, India. The process is characterised by hand printed wood block relief prints with naturally sourced pigments and dyes. Bagh print motifs are typically geometric, paisley, or floral compositions design, dyed with vegetable colours of red and black over a white background, and is a popular textile printing product. Its name is derived from the village Bagh located on the banks of the Bagh River."
"A Sambalpuri sari is a traditional handwoven ikat or sari (locally called sadhi) wherein the warp and the weft are tie-dyed before weaving. It is produced in the Sambalpur, Balangir, Bargarh, Boudh and Sonepur districts of Odisha, India. The sari is a traditional female garment in the Indian subcontinent consisting of a strip of unstitched cloth ranging from four to nine metres in length that is draped over the body in various styles. Sambalpuri saris are known for their incorporation of traditional motifs like shankha (shell), chakra (wheel), phula (flower), all of which have deep symbolism with the native Odia colour red black and white represent true Odia Culture along with Lord Kaalia (Jagannatha)'s face colour, but the highpoint of these saris is the traditional craftsmanship of the 'Bandhakala', the Tie-dye art reflected in their intricate weaves, also known as Sambalpuri ""Ikkat"". In this technique, the threads are first tie-dyed and later woven into a fabric, with the entire process taking many weeks. These saris first became popular outside the state when the late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi started wearing them. In the 1980s and 1990s they became popular across India. To provide protection to the weavers practicing this art, the handloom silk saris manufactured in Sambalpur and Berhampur (Berhampur Patta) in Odisha were included in the Government of India’s Geographical Indications (GI) registry."
"The Drăgășani Wine Museum (Romanian: Muzeul Viei și Vinului) is a museum located at 22 Gib Mihăescu Street, Drăgășani, Romania. The building housing the museum was completed before 1920 by Dumitru C. Popescu, a prosperous local merchant. It features the Neo-Brâncovenesc style. Early on, it was used for stores. After the onset of the communist regime, the local Militia was headquartered there. Converted into a museum in 1974, it opened to the public in 1983. The museum traces its origins to the period after World War I, when a small display existed in a school. In 1952, two residents began putting together a collection. The current display focuses on the regional wine industry, and is divided into three sections: wine production, art and archaeology. The museum is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs."
The Neck Amphora by Exekias is a neck amphora in the black figure style by the Attic vase painter and potter Exekias. It is found in the possession of the Antikensammlung Berlin under the inventory number F 1720 and is on display in the Altes Museum. It depicts Herakles' battle with the Nemean lion on one side and the sons of Theseus on the other (their earliest appearance in Athenian art).

"El Vino, also known as El Vino's, is a wine bar and off-licence in Fleet Street that was famously patronised by journalists when many national newspapers were based nearby. The business was founded by the wine merchant Alfred Bower in Mark Lane as Bower and Co. in 1879. That was on the east side of the City of London and, as the business prospered by selling imported Burgundy, claret and sherry, he opened four more wine bars, including the famous branch in Fleet Street. In 1923, the business had to change its name so that Bower could become an alderman, and so it was renamed El Vino – the Spanish name for wine. Bower then became Lord Mayor and the business continued in his family until 2015, when it was sold to the Davy chain of wine bars. For much of its history, the bar required male customers to wear ties, and although women customers were permitted, they were not allowed to approach the bar to be served until a discrimination case was raised in 1982."
"The Government Wine Cellar (GWC) is a provider of wine to support the hospitality work of United Kingdom's government. It was founded in 1908 and since 1922 has been housed in a cellar of Lancaster House in London. The cellar is estimated to contain around 39,000 bottles of wine and spirits estimated at a value of over £2 million. The cellar is managed day-to-day by the Government Butler and is overseen by the head of Government Hospitality coming under the jurisdiction of the Foreign Office. It was originally stocked on the advice of the Government Hospitality Advisory Committee for the Purchase of Wine, a quango that was abolished in 2010. Before its abolition, the committee met two or three times a year in the cellar, around a table carved from an elm tree that blew down in St James's Park in around 1830. The role of the committee was to taste the wines, make recommendations for new purchases to keep the cellar stocked, and to sell a portion on the open market to fund the restocking process. They also graded the wines and offered serving suggestions. Since 2010 cellar has been stocked according to recommendations from a specialist committee of Masters of Wine, chaired by a former diplomat. Aside from the Government Butler, access to the cellar is strictly limited to Permanent Secretaries and Ministers. The wine is served according to a complex system. Ministers are asked to give their preferences when they take office. Food being served at the banquet or function is usually factored in. National sensitivities and customs are also considered – for example when there is a Chinese delegation vintages from 1988 are used, as '8' is considered a lucky number in China. The cellar includes wines from Château Lafite, Cheval Blanc, Cos d’Estournel, Mouton Rothschild and Le Pin. It had previously held over seventeen different types of Champagne including a magnum of Champagne Krug 1964 and still holds such valuable spirits as an 1878 and 1931 . English and Welsh wines are estimated to make up 44% of all those served in 2016, including Nyetimber’s demi-sec. The Foreign Office have stated that the most the cellar has ever spent on a single bottle of wine is £100."
"Sherry vinegar (Spanish: vinagre de Jerez) is a gourmet wine vinegar made from sherry. It is produced in the Spanish province of Cádiz and inside the triangular area between the city of Jerez de la Frontera and towns of Sanlúcar de Barrameda and El Puerto de Santa María, known as the ""sherry triangle"". In the USA, to be called vinagre de Jerez, by law the sherry vinegar must undergo ageing in American oak for a minimum of six months, can only be aged within the ""sherry triangle"" and must have a minimum of 7 degrees acidity. Most sherry vinegars are aged using the same solera system as the sherry wines and Brandy de Jerez. The production and quality of sherry vinegar is monitored and controlled by the Consejo Regulador and sherry vinegar has its own Denominación de Origen, which is protected by Spanish and EU law. The only other vinegars with similar protected designation of origin are ""Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale"" from Modena and Reggio Emilia in Italy and ""Condado de Huelva"" in Spain."

"Cerebus (/ˈsɛrəbəs/; also Cerebus the Aardvark) is a comic book series created by Canadian cartoonist Dave Sim, which ran from December 1977 until March 2004. The title character of the 300-issue series is an anthropomorphic aardvark who takes on a number of roles throughout the series—barbarian, prime minister and Pope among them. The series stands out for its experimentation in form and content, and for the dexterity of its artwork, especially after background artist Gerhard joined with the 65th issue. As the series progressed, it increasingly became a platform for Sim's controversial beliefs. The comic began as a parody of sword and sorcery comics, primarily Marvel's version of Conan the Barbarian. However, it evolved to explore a variety of other topics, including politics, religion, and gender issues. At a total of 6,000 pages, it progressively became more serious and ambitious than its parodic roots. Sim announced early on that the series would end with the death of the title character. The story has a large cast of characters, many of which began as parodies of characters from comic books and popular culture. Starting with the ""High Society"" storyline, the series became divided into self-contained ""novels"", which form parts of the overall story. The ten ""novels"" of the series have been collected in 16 books, known as ""Cerebus phonebooks"" for their resemblance, by way of their thickness, to telephone directories. At a time when the series was about 70% completed, celebrated comic book writer Alan Moore wrote, ""Cerebus, as if I need to say so, is still to comic books what Hydrogen is to the Periodic Table."""

"Norman Stanley ""Fletch"" Fletcher is the main fictional character in the BBC sitcom Porridge, and the spin-off, Going Straight. He was played by Ronnie Barker. In the pilot episode Fletcher claims to Mr Barrowclough that he was sentenced for stealing a lorry which then crashed through garden walls and a tool-shed when its brakes failed. This turns out a shaggy dog story leading up to the punchline ""I asked for six other fences to be taken into consideration"". In other episodes it is stated that he was sentenced for breaking and entering and that he is a career burglar. His tactics range from the practical (stealing pills from the prison doctor and eggs from the prison farmyard), to the symbolic (finding new and imaginative ways to stick two fingers up at Mackay and get away with it). In return, Mackay's frenzied, neurotic attempts to catch Fletch out, when fruitful, give the warder a level of smugness and satisfaction that is only accentuated by his charge's hostility and skulking. Fletch is also surprised when this spell in prison finds him taking on the role of the father figure. It is left to him to help Warren when he needs a letter read or written, and to oversee new, younger inmates such as McClaren and Godber. Fletch is also manipulative, and can play upon the sympathies and weaknesses of people like the liberal warden, Mr Barrowclough, and the ineffectual prison governor to acquire more pleasant employment, accommodation or special privileges. Fletcher was born, in his words, ""two-two-thirty-two"" - 2 February 1932. He is a native of Muswell Hill. His elder daughter Ingrid was conceived in Highgate Cemetery, shortly before his marriage to Isobel at the age of 19. He also has a younger daughter Marion and a son Raymond. Fletcher did his post-war National Service in the early 1950s, including service in the Malayan Emergency. He joined the Royal Army Service Corps or RASC, which he refers to in army slang as ""Run Away, Someone's Coming"". He was ""King of the Teds"" in Muswell Hill, circa 1955, and retains fond memories of Gloria, a seamstress with whom he had an affair at that time, and who used to tighten his trousers for him. Upon release from prison Fletch decided to give up his criminal career. In the follow-up series, Going Straight, he took a job as a hotel night-porter, but found himself often tempted back into crime, although he resisted. His wife, Isobel, had left him, leaving him in sole charge of Raymond. When last seen, in the mockumentary Life Beyond the Box: Norman Stanley Fletcher, Fletch was landlord of a pub in Muswell Hill, alongside his second wife, Gloria (an old flame briefly mentioned in Porridge). In 2009, the character was revived in a stage production, penned by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, and is played by Shaun Williamson. In the 2016 revival of the show, also titled Porridge, it is revealed that Fletcher died circa 2011."

"Katherine ""Kathy"" Beale (also Mitchell and Sullivan) is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Gillian Taylforth. Portrayed as ""an attractive, bright, caring and highly moral woman"", Kathy is one of the serial's original characters, appearing in the first episode of EastEnders on 19 February 1985. Taylforth was originally dismissed for the role of Kathy due to her young age, but was reconsidered when she impressed show bosses. Kathy remained in a prominent role throughout her original stint on the serial, featuring in high-profiled storylines involving her rape at the hands of James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde) and the discovery of a long-lost daughter, Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler), after she was sexually assaulted as a teenager. In 1993, after the character's marriage with her husband Pete (Peter Dean) ended with the latter's departure from the square, Kathy developed a romance with Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) and they later had a son - Ben, who caused Kathy turmoil when he contracted a rare form of meningitis. The relationship between alcohol abuse and domestic violence was explored through Kathy and Phil in 1997, which led to their separation. Taylforth opted to leave the serial in 1997 and Kathy departed on 10 April 1998 after deciding to move to South Africa with Ben. The character returned for two separate guest stints in 1999, making her departure on 6 January 2000. Despite reports that Taylforth would be returning to the serial, Kathy was killed off-screen in a road collision in 2006 to facilitate Ben's reintroduction to the serial.

It was confirmed that the character would be making a permanent return, and - after a guest appearance on 19 May 2015 - Kathy returned permanently on 17 August 2015. Taylforth was initially hesitant about her reintroduction storyline, which was inspired by the John Darwin disappearance case. Kathy's husband, Gavin Sullivan (Paul Nicholas), was also introduced following her return and their turbulent marriage was explored. The character later had an affair with Buster Briggs (Karl Howman), and became critical in the events surrounding Max Branning's (Jake Wood) revenge campaign Albert Square - in light of the Who Killed Lucy Beale? saga - when James Willmott-Brown reappeared in his plan to recoup his relationship with Kathy by taking control of the square for her. Additionally, Kathy has had a brief relationship with Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra) and feuds with both Max Branning (Jake Wood) and Rainie Cross (Tanya Franks) over the custody of her step-grandson Steven's daughter, Abi Jr."

"Angie Watts is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Anita Dobson from the first episode of the series until 1988, when Dobson decided to leave, and the character was written out. Angie is well known for her cheeky banter, her perm and turning to alcohol during her stormy marriage to cheating Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), which ended when he handed her divorce papers on Christmas Day 1986, in an episode watched by a record-breaking 30.1 million viewers. Despite being the loud and feisty lady of Walford, and having a close relationship with her beloved adoptive daughter Sharon (Letitia Dean), she doesn't have much real happiness during her time in Albert Square. Alcoholism claimed her life in April 2002 when she died of cirrhosis of the liver, 14 years after her last appearance."
"Dennis ""Den"" Watts is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by actor Leslie Grantham. He became well known for his tabloid nickname, ""Dirty Den"". Den was the original landlord of The Queen Victoria public house from Albert Square – the local community of Walford, a fictionalized borough in East London – who first appeared back when the show debuted on 19 February 1985. From then onwards, the character had a turbulent marriage with his alcoholic first wife Angie (Anita Dobson). In 1986, Den discovered that Angie lied to him about having six months to live and got revenge by giving her divorce papers on Christmas Day 1986 - which was watched by over 30 million viewers. While his marriage with Angie was finished beyond repair, Den continued his close relationship with their adopted daughter Sharon (Letitia Dean) – whom he grew fondly devoted towards throughout his time on the programme. Den soon became involved in storylines that mostly contributed to the character's magnanimous and ""bad boy"" persona, such as Den impregnating sixteen year old Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) – which resulted in a long-standing feud with Michelle's mother Pauline (Wendy Richard); teaming up with longtime companion Pete Beale (Peter Dean) to force their enemy Nick Cotton (John Altman) out of Walford for causing trouble around the square; romancing with his mistress Jan Hammond (Jane How); and getting revenge on business rival James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde) for raping Pete's beloved wife Kathy (Gillian Taylforth). Grantham quit the series in 1988, and in February 1989, Den was apparently killed off after getting shot, due to his involvement with The Firm – a criminal organization who ended up trying to have him murdered in light of the character's imprisonment for having one of its members help him get revenge against Willmott-Brown. Despite turning down several offers to return to the series, Grantham reprised the role of Den in 2003. The character returned 14 years later in a highly publicized week in September 2003, where Sharon discovered that Den had survived his shooting and had fled to Spain afterwards. The development of Den's return to the show was contributed with the introductions of his and Michelle's daughter Vicki (Scarlett Alice Johnson), as well as Den's biological son Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman), and later the character's manipulative second wife Chrissie (Tracy-Ann Oberman) in 2004. His second stint on the programme saw Den repeatedly clash with Dennis over his romantic feelings for Sharon – which sparked a longstanding father-son feud that escalated after Den discovered that Dennis had killed his mob boss Jack Dalton (Hywel Bennett), and subsequently destroyed his relationship with Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan), by getting her to lie to Dennis that she was pregnant with their baby. Additionally, Den established a rivalry with Sharon's ex-boyfriend Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) that ended with him framing the latter for armed robbery; formed a friendship with Dot Branning (June Brown); slept with Phil's ex-wife Kate Morton (Jill Halfpenny) and his sister Sam (Kim Medcalf) as revenge; became publicly humiliated after losing a high-stakes poker game to the square's crime kingpin Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs); and conned Sam into relinquishing her ownership of The Queen Vic back to him by blackmailing her lawyer Marcus Christie (Stephen Churchett). Grantham was axed in 2004 due to an internet scandal, and Den was ultimately killed-off for good on 18 February 2005, during the show's 20th anniversary episode that also featured Andy being murdered by his gangland successor Johnny Allen (Billy Murray) – who would later have Dennis killed on New Year's Eve 2005. Chrissie had conspired with Sam and Zoe to get revenge on Den for victimising them. They did so by destroying his relationship with Sharon, an act which prompted Den to attack Chrissie, that resulted in Zoe hitting him with Pauline's dog doorstop; this seemingly killed Den until he regained consciousness and was fatally bludgeoned to death by Chrissie. The character's death was watched by 17 million viewers – and would later serve as the most important storyline of 2005 with Sharon teaming up with Phil, along with his brother Grant (Ross Kemp) and their mother Peggy (Barbara Windsor), to exonerate Sam after Chrissie framed her for Den's murder."
"Simon ""Wicksy"" Wicks is a fictional character from the British BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Nick Berry between 1985 and 1990.

Wicksy was the soap's first male pin-up. An early storyline saw Wicksy perform a song in the serial, ""Every Loser Wins"", which was subsequently released as a single in 1986 and reached number one in the UK Singles Chart. One of Wicksy's most prominent storylines was his adultery with Cindy Beale, and a subsequent feud with Cindy's husband, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt).

Willmott-Brown then developed a romantic obsession with his employee Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth), which sparked the events of the character raping her in 1988. Following his imprisonment for Kathy's rape, Willmott-Brown made a brief comeback in 1992 after he moved back into Albert Square; however, he was forced to leave by Kathy's former husband Pete (Peter Dean) just weeks later. After an absence of 25 years, Willmott-Brown returned on 22 September 2017 as the show's hidden main antagonist upon being revealed to be the boss of Max Branning (Jake Wood) in their vengeful plot to destroy the square; with Willmott-Brown serving as the true mastermind behind the events in Max's revenge story arc carried out by his company, Weyland & Co.

"Frank Butcher is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Mike Reid. Frank makes his first appearance on-screen as a guest character in 1987, but due to a positive viewer reception, he is reintroduced in 1988 as a regular. Reid took a long hiatus from EastEnders in 1994 and Frank remained off-screen for over a year and a half. Frank made his return as a recurring character from December 1995 to January 1998. Frank eventually becomes a regular once again from May 1998 to November 2000, when Reid quit the show. Frank makes three brief reappearances after that, the final one in December 2005. Given the widespread identification of Mike Reid as Frank, Reid's death in July 2007 led to BBC bosses deciding that it would not be possible for the character to return in the future. In November 2007, it was announced that the character would die off-screen and in April 2008 his funeral was screened as part of a special set of episodes, dubbed ""Frank Week"". Frank is a wheeler-dealer who likes to think of himself as a ""big player"" in the business world, but in reality, he is little more than a wily conman. He is a smooth-talker and full of charm, but his actions are often thoughtless and he tends to run instead of facing up to his responsibilities, leaving his loved ones to pick up the pieces. His love affair with Pat Harris (Pam St Clement) stems back to his teens, and he can never quite let her go, always breaking her heart, disappearing, and returning to break it all over again."

"Grant Mitchell is a fictional character from the British soap opera EastEnders, played by Ross Kemp. He was introduced by producer Michael Ferguson to revamp the show, and originally served as one of the show's leading protagonists throughout the 1990s; with the character first appearing in 22 February 1990 and then departing on 25 October 1999 after Kemp had opted to leave the show. He then returned to the show on 24 October 2005 for a few weeks and returned again between March and June 2006. Kemp was persuaded to return to the role for brief stints during a period of heavy media criticism aimed at EastEnders. The return proved to be a ratings success. Kemp reprised the role of Grant for various guest stints in 2016, appearing in twelve episodes between 13 May and 9 September. Throughout the course of his 1990s duration, Grant established himself as one of the show's most prominent characters. He was portrayed as a tough persona, wildly known for his fiery temper and his tendency to resort to violence. Despite this, however, his family is important to him – particularly his relationship with his older brother Phil (Steve McFadden). Known as the ""Mitchell brothers"", Grant and Phil have become household names in the United Kingdom – due to their association with the stereotypical black leather jacket wearing bald and brutal thug. They have been parodied even in adverts where their gruff, tough talking, cockney accents have been impersonated. One of EastEnders' most popular and highly rated storylines was ""Sharongate"", where Grant discovers that his wife Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) has been having an affair with his brother. In light of this iconic revelation, Grant attacked Phil and exacted revenge on Sharon until she departed the programme following her betrayal. Grant then went on to embark on a second marriage with local barmaid Tiffany Raymond (Martine McCutcheon), up to the point where she gave birth to their daughter – Courtney. However, their marriage ended in tragedy when Grant's prolonging mistreatment towards Tiffany ultimately led to her being accidentally killed by his would-be stepfather Frank Butcher (Mike Reid). The character has also become a prime suspect in the murder of Sharon's hated boss Eddie Royle (Michael Melia); sparked a longstanding feud with her best-friend Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully); clashed with Peggy's campaign rival George Palmer (Paul Moriarty); developed a close friendship with local shopkeeper Nigel Bates (Paul Bradley); formed a conflict with Sam's former boyfriend David Wicks (Michael French); slept with David's wife Lorraine Wicks (Jacqueline Leonard) they secretly harbored feelings for each other; cheated on Tiffany by having an affair with her mother Louise (Carol Harrison); triggered a rivalry with his archenemy Beppe di Marco (Michael Greco); disputed with Beppe's younger brother Gianni (Marc Bannerman); worked with Palmer's daughter Annie (Nadia Sawalha) on a jointed business venture at the local gym; established an antagonistic business partnership with Phil's would-be sworn nemesis, Steve Owen (Martin Kemp); had a one-night stand with Phil's estranged wife Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth); exonerated Sam for the murder of Sharon's adopted father, Den (Leslie Grantham), by proving to his ex-wife that her stepmother Chrissie (Tracy Ann Oberman) was responsible for the crime; teamed up with Phil to confront their mother's gangland enemy, Johnny Allen (Billy Murray), and get justice for the death of Sharon's adopted brother-turned-second husband Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) in the Get Johnny Week scenario; infuriated Kathy's son Ian (Adam Woodyatt) after sleeping with his eventual lover Jane (Laurie Brett) prior to their wedding; ended his third ill-fated marriage to Carla (Christianne Oliveira) upon learning that she turned him against Courtney; and discovered that he is the father of Michelle's secret son, Mark (Ned Porteous), in light of coping with losing his mother Peggy to cancer. Despite his tough nature, he is also a womanizer and has been involved in several relationships with an array of women – including Julie Cooper (Louise Plowright), Nina Harris (Troy Titus-Adams), and Chelsea Fox (Tiana Benjamin). While he has calmed down in recent years, Grant is still feared by people in and around Walford."

The third member of the Mitchell family to be introduced, Sam arrived as a 15-year-old school girl in July 1990, played by Danniella Westbrook. The actress quit in 1993, but Sam was reintroduced from 1995 to 1996 and from 1999 to 2000. In both her 1996 and 2000 exits, Sam was written out earlier than the producers intended due to off-screen controversies surrounding Westbrook. In early 2002, the character was reintroduced for a fourth time, but the role was recast to another actress, Kim Medcalf, who stayed in the role until late 2005. Diederick Santer later decided to reintroduce the character for a brief stint in 2009 and he opted to bring Westbrook back. Sam resurfaced in September 2009 for a short stint and departed in January 2010, before then reappearing for another short stint from August until September that year. In 2016, Westbrook agreed to reprise the role once again in the events that surrounded the funeral for her on-screen mother Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor); this started on 30 June that and finished after four episodes on 8 July. The character of Sam Mitchell was initially portrayed as a young, naive girl who had initially relied less upon her mother Peggy (Jo Warne/Barbara Windsor) than her two older brothers Phil (Steve McFadden) and Grant (Ross Kemp) - although she gradually evolved into becoming more flirty, headstrong, and charismatic, with a determination to be taken more seriously.

The eventual episode in which Matthew enacted revenge on Steve drew in outstanding viewing figures and brought a storyline that had gripped the nation to a close. Afterwards, Steve embarked on a dangerous feud with his arch nemesis: Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). The ensuing conflict between them grew intensifying as Steve later became sworn enemies with Phil's best-friend-turned-hardman adversary, Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass), which had continued to develop in the case of both Dan and Phil having respective connections to Steve's girlfriend and future wife: Mel Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite). Additionally, Steve contributed to his significant interaction with other members of the Mitchell family by establishing an antagonistic business partnership with Phil's brother Grant (Ross Kemp); sleeping with their younger sister Sam (Kim Medcalf); employing the siblings' cousin, Billy (Perry Fenwick), to work for him as his errand boy; clashing with Phil's adolescent godson Jamie (Jack Ryder); and sparking a quarrel with the family's matriarch, Peggy (Barbara Windsor), over his managing stake of her public house called The Queen Victoria. In 2001, the character was involved in one of the show's greatest and most memorable storylines of all-time when Steve became a prime suspect in ""Who Shot Phil?"". The epic whodunit scenario began with Steve marrying Mel on the day of Phil's shooting and ultimately concluded with Dan kidnapping Mel for ransom against both Steve and Phil, after the pair had worked together to implicate Dan behind the shooting – even though the culprit was earlier revealed to be Phil's ex-girlfriend and Mel's closest companion: Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin). Martin Kemp soon quit the series after his contract to the show had expired, and his final scenes were aired on 1 March 2002 – the first anniversary of both Steve's wedding and Phil's shooting. In that episode, Steve made a last-ditch attempt to settle his score with Phil by fleeing the country and starting anew in America with his and Lisa's infant daughter Louise — which triggered a fierce car chase between the two archenemies that ended with Steve being killed after he crashed his car and consequently died in a vehicle explosion, though not before he helped Phil save Louise in his last moments; the character's funeral aired on 11 March 2002 and his onscreen wife Mel later departed a month later on 12 April that year in light of Steve's death. It was thereafter alleged that producers had intentionally killed off Steve as ""revenge"" for Martin Kemp leaving the show to make the transition from the BBC to rival station ITV. Nevertheless, Kemp received multiple award nominations and victories for his critically-acclaimed portrayal of Steve Owen."

Billy was originally introduced by producer Matthew Robinson as a guest character, as part facilitating the introduction of Jamie Mitchell (Jack Ryder) to the show. Early on, Billy was Jamie's abusive uncle and guardian - which results Jamie being taken away from Billy by his relative Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden).

"Dan Sullivan is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Craig Fairbrass. He was first introduced to the series as a regular character from 7 June 1999 to 10 July 2000 before returning as one of the show's primary antagonists from 26 February to 16 August 2001. The character originally appeared in Albert Square as the new boyfriend of local resident Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson), but it quickly transpired that Dan had previously had a relationship with her daughter Bianca (Patsy Palmer); he soon embarked on an affair with Bianca until her mother eventually found out about it and Carol thereupon exposed this to Bianca's husband Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) — which later resulted in the latter being written out of the programme alongside both Bianca and Carol. Soon afterwards, Dan established an intense feud with Ricky's stepbrother Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden); they started out as best-friends when Phil's brother Grant (Ross Kemp) left the square and even went into business partnership at The Queen Victoria public house, but ended up becoming archenemies after Phil conned Dan's ownership of the pub in retribution for Dan reporting Phil to the police about his motor scam with both Ricky's father Frank (Mike Reid) and his longtime companion Roy Evans (Tony Caunter). The ensuing rivalry between Dan and Phil continued to escalate in one of the show's greatest and most memorable storylines in soap history, Who Shot Phil?; wherein Dan becomes a prime suspect after Phil gets shot on the night their ex-lover Mel Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite) married the duo's fellow nemesis Steve Owen (Martin Kemp). By then, Dan's growing conflicts with both Phil and Steve were respectively steamed from each of their own romances with Mel — whom Dan had formerly dated after his relationship with one of the pub's customers, Teresa di Marco (Leila Birch), ended with the character sparking a quarrel with her overprotective brother Gianni (Marc Bannerman). He also ends up squaring up against the Mitchell family amid the ""Who Shot Phil"" scenario by clashing with Phil's mother Peggy (Barbara Windsor); extorting money from his godson Jamie (Jack Ryder); and tormenting the latter's estranged uncle Billy (Perry Fenwick). Although it was ultimately revealed on 5 April 2001 that Phil's ex-girlfriend Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin) was in fact the shooter, Phil ends up framing Dan for the crime by colluding with his former crime boss Ritchie Stringer (Gareth Hunt) against him; Dan is consequently arrested and wrongfully imprisoned prior to his trial in mid-summer 2001. While Phil and Steve — though sworn enemies — worked together to rid themselves of their common adversary, the trial culminated with Dan being found not guilty by the jury. Afterwards, Dan sought to get revenge on both Phil and Steve by kidnapping Mel and then blackmailing his two alpha male rivals into giving him £100,000 each in exchange for her safety. The storyline of Mel's kidnapping, which occurred in August 2001 and simultaneously commenced the stage where the show would start presenting four episodes a week, led to a climatic showdown between Dan and Phil on 16 August 2001 when the former forced the latter to make the exchange of the ransom money for Mel. The confrontation between them saw Phil disarm Dan and preparing to kill him, but Dan ultimately overpowered Phil with Mel's help after she gradually realized that Dan was indeed framed for Phil's shooting. In the end, Dan got his revenge and — after taking Mel back to the square — left the country with his £200,000 ransom; the character had exited the show on 16 August 2001 at the end of Mel's kidnapping scenario."

Little Mo originally appeared with a turbulent marriage with her abusive husband Trevor Morgan (Alex Ferns), but she fought back at Trevor – leading to her arrest in 2002; she is later released and Trevor's campaign against her ends with his death on 1 November 2002. Following Trevor's death, Little Mo proceeds to marry his sworn enemy Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) – who had grown to care and bond with Little Mo during her ordeal. However, their marriage ends after she gets raped by her friend Graham Foster (Alex McSweeney) and discovers she is pregnant by him; the storyline that signals the end of Little Mo's marriage with Billy contributes to Ainsworth's maternity leave in 2004. The character soon reappeared with her baby son, Freddie (Alex and Tom Kilby), and later embarks on an affair with her brother-in-law Alfie Moon (Shane Ritchie) – which is later discovered by her sister and Alfie's wife Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace). Later on, Little Mo develops a relationship with habitual doctor Oliver Cousins (Tom Ellis) – though they soon break-up when she is accused of hurting Freddie.

She is also played by Kate Peck in a flashback in 2001 and Sumar-Elise Sandford in a flashback in 2018. Kat is the second eldest Slater family sister and first appeared on 18 September 2000. Kat's usual dress is very short skirts and leopard-print tops, with much make-up and heavy fake tan. She would often go on all-night binges and has slept with many men, but calmed down in more recent years. As such, she can be described as a ""tart with a heart"" character. Her initial stint saw her involved in many storylines, most significantly in a plot twist which sees her sister Zoe (Michelle Ryan), revealed to be her daughter after she was raped by her uncle Harry (Michael Elphick) as a child. Another key aspect to the character's storylines is her marriage to Alfie Moon (Shane Richie), prior to which she became briefly engaged to Alfie's love rival Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs); after Kat jilted Andy on their wedding day, he blackmailed her into sleeping with him in his revenge bid against Alfie and Kat. Wallace has won multiple awards for her portrayal as Kat, who has become one of the show's best loved characters.

Kat departed on 23 March 2020 and returned on 7 September 2020. In the events of Kat's second stint on the soap, in what was called ""the biggest soap story in probably the history of soaps"", Kat and Ronnie Branning (Samantha Womack) both give birth on the same day, but Ronnie's baby, James Branning, dies and while Kat is in hospital and her baby, Tommy Moon, is unattended, Ronnie swaps the infants. The storyline received over 6,000 complaints, making it the second most complained about EastEnders storyline. Kat's storylines also include suffering a miscarriage, an affair with Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) which briefly ends her marriage with Alfie, becoming penniless and permanently scarred in a fire and becoming a millionaire. In 2015 Kat's most prominent storyline – the character's rape, is revisited when it is revealed that Kat had given birth to twins and she has a secret son, Zoe's twin brother and this facilitates the characters second exit from the soap. In Kat & Alfie: Redwater, Kat discovers her son is a murderous Catholic priest, Dermott Dolan (Oisín Stack). Since her reintroduction in 2018, Kat's storylines have focused on the breakdown of her and Alfie's marriage and her separation from her children, a relationship with Kush Kazemi (Davood Ghadami), feuds with both her cousin Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) and Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), which leads to the latter suffering from an injury caused by Stacey, supporting her friend Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) with her stalker Leo King (Tom Wells) and developing feelings for Phil after sleeping with him, and surviving a hit-and-run perpetrated by Whitney."

"Chrissie Watts is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Tracy-Ann Oberman. She first appeared on 29 April 2004 and was transpired to be the second wife of the show's ""most enduring character"", Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) - thus ended up becoming becoming a prominent regular for the next 18 months. In 2005, Chrissie was the focus of one of ""the programme's biggest and most high-profile narratives"" when she murdered her husband in self-defense at the end of the special 20th anniversary episode. The broadcast, airing on 18 February, was watched by 14.34 million people - with ""almost 60% of possible viewers"" tuning in to see Chrissie killing Den. The character was credited by former head of BBC Drama Serials, Mal Young, as ""anchoring the success of the anniversary storyline"", and was described on the news programme BBC Breakfast as the ""centrepiece"" of the show, with the on-screen drama playing out over the course of the year and culminating in Chrissie's departure on 9 December 2005. Chrissie Watts was created by the production team to be more the ""equal"" of her notorious and villainous husband than his long-suffering first wife, Angie (Anita Dobson). The character was described by Oberman as being like Angie ""but with 15 more years of feminism behind her"", and was hailed by the TV editor of the Evening Standard as ""the only strong woman left in Walford"". She became well known for her deviousness and ""scheming"", echoing the traits of her husband, with the official EastEnders website characterising her as ""happy to play mind games"" and ""often two steps ahead"" of Den. As part of the Watts family and the last of its major members to have appeared on the show, Chrissie's storylines explored her tumultuous marriage to Den; bonding with his adopted daughter Sharon (Letitia Dean) and her two half-siblings, Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) and Vicki Fowler (Scarlett Alice Johnson); conspiring with Den to retake ownership of The Queen Victoria public house; forming a relationship with her boyfriend Jake Moon (Joel Beckett) after Den's murder; attempting to sell the Queen Vic Jake's gangland boss Johnny Allen (Billy Murray) and local businessman Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt); being blackmailed by young wayward Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner); and feuding with the rival Mitchell family.

It was noted by Oberman herself that Chrissie ""had more fights on EastEnders than most women have in their whole lives"", and was constantly scheming against those who got in her way - thereby earning her the sobriquet of ""super-bitch"". Oberman won praise for her ""three-dimensional portrayal of a classic soap bitch"", with Chrissie hailed as ""helping revive the show's fortunes that had been lagging somewhat in recent years"". According to the Daily Mirror reporter Elizabeth Hassell, the character became a ""national TV heroine"" to viewers shortly after arriving, for standing up to the antics of her dastardly husband, and is most often cited as a ""strong"" and ""clever"" woman, as well as being ""hard as nails"" in ""the grand tradition of landladies of The Queen Vic"". Although generally well received by viewers, the character was described as a ""ludicrous Lady MacBeth wannabe"" by Jim Shelley of the Daily Mirror. Other critics have variously called Chrissie a ""witch"", ""venomous"", and the show's resident ""black widow""."

Her major storylines have included the paternity of her daughter Amy Mitchell (Abbie Knowles), becoming Landlady of The Queen Victoria, becoming a millionairess before squandering all the money on frivolous spending, her popular friendship with Christian Clarke (John Partridge), a feud with Alfie's ex-wife Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace), one-night stands with her sister's two husbands Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) and Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett), Dean's attempted rape of her, and becoming a drugs mule.

"Veronica ""Ronnie"" Branning (also Mitchell) is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera, EastEnders, played by Samantha Womack. She and her younger sister Roxy Mitchell (played by Rita Simons) were introduced by executive producer Diederick Santer in July 2007. Ronnie is the ""ice"" to Roxy's ""fire"". As an extension to the already established Mitchell family, Ronnie quickly became a prominent character, taking over the nightclub. She later formed an on-off relationship with her business partner, Jack Branning (Scott Maslen). The character is introduced during the episode first broadcast on 24 July 2007. Her first major storyline saw Ronnie clash with her villainous father, Archie (Larry Lamb), after it transpired that he forced his eldest daughter — at the age of 14 — to give up her newborn baby just moments after she gave birth to it. This escalates in The Secret Mitchell and Who Killed Archie? scenarios, wherein the former explores Ronnie's friendship with her employee Danielle Jones (Lauren Crace) — who later turns out to be her long-lost daughter — and the latter reveals that Archie had raped Ronnie when she was 13. Soon afterwards, Ronnie becomes the subject of a controversial storyline where she swaps her dead baby with that of Tommy Moon — the son of her close friend Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace). This contributes to the development of Womack leaving the role in 2011, with the character departing in the episode shown on 7 July 2011. In May 2013, show bosses announced that Womack would return to EastEnders as Ronnie for six months. Womack returned on screen for two three-month-long stints, from 9 September 2013 to 1 January 2014 and from 3 March to 23 June 2014. She then returned full-time to screens on 25 September 2014. Womack's second stint on the show saw Ronnie involved in storylines such as killing Carl White (Daniel Coonan) in self-defence, marrying Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett) and having a child with him, having an affair with Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood), attempting to poison Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo), being stalked by Andy Flynn (Jack Derges), and remarrying Jack before drowning along with Roxy in a swimming pool. In August 2016, it was reported that Ronnie and Roxy would depart together in a ""dramatic exit"". The sisters were killed off on 1 January 2017 after Ronnie's second wedding to Jack, although Ronnie appears on-screen for a final time when Jack visits her corpse on 19 January 2017."
"Lorraine ""Rainie"" Highway (also Cross and Branning) is a fictional character from the BBC One soap opera EastEnders, played by Tanya Franks. Introduced as the drug-addicted sister of Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner), Franks has had three separate guest stints in 2007 (two episodes), 2008 (four episodes) and 2010 (seven episodes) and between 12 April and 8 December 2011. Rainie returned on 16 June 2014, when she was revealed as Ian Beale's (Adam Woodyatt) mystery phone contact, having been with Ian on Good Friday, the night of Lucy Beale's (Hetti Bywater) murder (see ""Who Killed Lucy Beale?"") but departed again not long after. In January 2015, it was confirmed that Rainie would return for the conclusion of the ""Who Killed Lucy Beale?"" storyline. Rainie made another guest appearance on 19 January 2018 and returned full-time to the show on 24 April 2018, now married to her former brother-in-law, Max Branning (Jake Wood). Since her permanent reintroduction, Rainie has had sex with both Max and Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), joined Max in a custody battle with her mother Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell) and her sister Tanya over Max and Tanya's granddaughter Abi, has feuded with Ben Mitchell (Max Bowden) and has kidnapped baby Abi. Rainie's other storylines have included a custody battle between Max and the Beale family over Abi, another drug relapse and her imprisonment for assault on Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth). She has since taken over the funeral parlour alongside her husband Stuart Highway (Ricky Champ). Described as ""the slightly broken sister who's one step away from a vodka bottle"", Rainie's storylines have often centred on her addictions to drugs and alcohol. During her seven episode guest stint in 2010, Rainie was involved in a highly criticised crack cocaine storyline with Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). It was branded ""inappropriate"" and ""horrid"" by the Daily Record. EastEnders star Natalie Cassidy (who plays Sonia Fowler) also criticised the storyline, saying she was ""shocked"", but Franks defended the storyline, though she herself was not surprised that viewers had complained."
"Archibald ""Archie"" Mitchell is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Larry Lamb. He first appeared on 8 July 2008 as a newest member of the Mitchell family - who had first appeared on the soap in 1990 - and became the show's main antagonist until the character was killed off on Christmas Day 2009; with Archie making his last appearance as a corpse on 28 December 2009 and later serving as a posthumous impact throughout the majority of 2010, which involves making a brief voice appearance on 19 July 2010 on a family video tape overheard by his ex-wife Glenda (Glynis Barber) and their two daughters Ronnie (Samantha Womack) and Roxy (Rita Simons) respectively. The character's story arc began with Archie being reunited with both his daughters in Weymouth. While it quickly grew evident that Archie had seemingly shared a closer bond with Roxy, his relationship with Ronnie became volatile and tempestuous – after it had transpired Ronnie was previously forced by her father to give up her newborn baby, Amy, for adoption shortly after she gave birth to the child at the age of 14. He soon instigates trouble between his two daughters by scheming with Suzy Branning (Maggie O'Neill) to destroy Roxy's marriage with Sean Slater (Robert Kazinsky) and later manipulating Ronnie into disbelieving the fact that her employee Danielle Jones (Lauren Crace) is actually her long-lost daughter Amy - the latter of which consequently resulted in Danielle being killed in a hit and run on the day Archie married his sister-in-law Peggy (Barbara Windsor). He was then kidnapped by Peggy's son Phil (Steve McFadden) and subsequently forced to leave Walford for good, but Archie ended up returning with the intent of getting revenge on his family. His plans gradually came to light when Archie forged a romantic partnership with Peggy's hated stepdaughter Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks); exploited Phil's sister Sam (Danniella Westbrook) while she was on the run for her involvement in the murder of the siblings' old enemy Den Watts (Leslie Grantham); and blackmailed Phil's stepson Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) with the knowledge that he cheated on his wife Jane (Laurie Brett) — which were all part of his scheme to successfully swindle his family from their beloved home, The Queen Victoria public house. He thereupon caused the death of Ronnie's unborn child and later betrayed Janine by leaving her temporarily homeless upon finding out that she and her boyfriend Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott) plotted to defraud his wealth in their get-rich-quick scheme. Shortly afterwards, Archie got his comeuppance when he was murdered on Christmas Night 2009 after an unknown assailant pushed the Bust of Queen Victoria onto him. This had both ended the character's reign of terror in 2009 and triggered the events of his own whodunit storyline, dubbed Who Killed Archie?, that occurred in early 2010. It was soon revealed two months later in the show's first live episode, ""EastEnders Live"", that Archie's murderer was in fact Sean's younger sister and Danielle's best friend: Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner) — whom he had raped on 6 October 2009 to cover-up his revenge scheme by escalating her bipolar disorder trauma, which led to Stacey being sectioned as a result of Archie raping her. During that same live episode, it also transpired that Archie had previously raped Ronnie back when she was 13; Ronnie would eventually describe this to her family on 20 July 2010."

The child sexual abuse storyline between Whitney and Tony marked the first time that the subject matter has been broached in a UK soap opera, and was researched and developed with advice and approval from the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. The inappropriate nature of Whitney's relationship with Tony resulted in over 200 complaints being made to the BBC and television regulatory body Ofcom by members of the public, and ""one of the darkest and most disturbing storylines EastEnders has ever attempted"" by the Daily Mirror's Beth Neil. The NSPCC however have praised the storyline for ""helping to raise awareness of the hidden nature of sexual abuse"". The storyline also gained EastEnders a Royal Television Society Programme Award in March 2009 in the Soap and Continuing Drama category."

The character was created by Dominic Treadwell-Collins, who came up with the idea of the Carter family before he became the executive producer of EastEnders. The character was influenced by Treadwell-Collins' own father.

Dyer's casting received a mixed response, with Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy feeling positive about the new character but calling it a risk, as Dyer is so well known, Vicky Prior from the Metro saying Dyer could be ""the saviour of the soap"". Several critics, as well as Dyer himself, hoped that he would help increase the show's ratings, but the casting was criticised by domestic violence charities because of previous comments Dyer was alleged to have made. Dyer has won several awards for the role, including the TV Choice Award for Best Soap Actor in 2014 and the National Television Award for Outstanding Serial Drama Performance in 2015, 2016 and 2019."

This long-running story arc involved Robert supporting Aaron upon discovering that he was sexually abused by his father, Gordon (Gary Mavers), as a child; becoming engaged to Aaron and later surprising him with an unofficial wedding between them in 2017; bonding with Aaron's half-sister Liv Flaherty (Isobel Steele), and temporally becoming her guardian after Aaron is arrested and sentenced to 12 months in prison – which involved Robert struggling to cope with Aaron's drug use amid serving his prison sentence; their marriage having a breakdown after Robert ends up sleeping with Chrissie's sister Rebecca (Emily Head); and the pair remarrying in 2018 after Robert and Aaron manage to reunite and reconcile over their differences. During this time, Robert's storyline with Andy and the Whites concluded with him and Andy making amends after the pair nearly killed each other in a car-game of chicken; Robert clearing Andy's name after Chrissie framed the latter for shooting her father Lawrence (John Bowe), with the culprit being her son Lachlan (Thomas Atkinson); his one-stand with Rebecca that results in her getting pregnant and giving birth to their son Sebastian; his scheme to con the Whites in a revenge plot; kidnapping Sebastian when he found out that Rebecca and her family were planning to emigrate with his son without his knowledge, which led to the events of Lachlan causing the deaths of Chrissie and Lawrence in a road collision; being held hostage by Lachlan after he and his girlfriend, Cain's half-sister Belle (Eden Taylor-Draper), discover that Lachlan had killed their friend Gerry Roberts (Shaun Thomas) and allegedly murdered his false uncle Paul Tozer (Daniel Casey) for discovering that he caused the deaths of his mother and grandmother; nursing Rebecca from her trauma of being kidnapped by Lachlan for months and later allowing her to leave the village with Sebastian to start anew with Ross, her new boyfriend; and supporting his sister Victoria (Isabel Hodgins) after learning that she had been raped by car salesman Lee Posner (Kris Mochrie). In the latter storyline, Robert ends up killing Lee after hospitalising him in retaliation for denying to have perpetuated Victoria's rape ordeal – which sparks the events of the character's impending departure from the show when Robert, after being detained and later pleading guilty to Lee's attack prior to his death, goes on the run to avoid going to prison for the murder he unintentionally committed."

"Sharon Newman is a fictional character from The Young and the Restless, an American soap opera on the CBS network, currently portrayed by Sharon Case. Created by William J. Bell as a love interest for Nicholas Newman, the character debuted on June 27, 1994. Before Case took over in September 1994, the character was portrayed briefly by Monica Potter and then by Heidi Mark. When first introduced, Sharon was a young girl from the poor side of town. Nick and Sharon married, had a son named Noah, and later won custody of Cassie, the child a teenaged Sharon had given up for adoption. Their marriage faced a number of problems, including infidelity on both sides. Following Cassie's death in an automobile accident, Nick cheated on Sharon with Phyllis Summers, resulting in a pregnancy which ended their 11-year marriage. Despite her second marriage to Jack Abbott, Nick and Sharon had an affair and conceived another child: Faith. During the pregnancy, Sharon experienced kleptomania. Faith was kidnapped by Adam Newman, Nick's half-brother, leading Sharon to believe she had died. When Adam's crimes were revealed and Faith was returned to Sharon, she remained in love with him; SoapNet considered the relationship ""dark"". Since 2011, former showrunner Maria Arena Bell and subsequent head writers that followed have significantly changed the character's direction, receiving negative backlash from critics and audiences. Sharon married her ex-father-in-law Victor Newman, gained control of his company (Newman Enterprises) and burned down his ranch—a sequence of events which resulted in her being diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The character was then involved in a DNA test alteration storyline, which was also heavily criticized by critics.

"Nicholas Newman is a fictional character from the American CBS soap opera The Young and the Restless. Created and introduced by William J. Bell, he was born onscreen in 1988 as the second child of supercouple characters Victor and Nikki Newman. Portrayed by a set of twins and later two child actors for his first six-year period, the writers of the series decided to rapidly age the character to a teenager in the summer of 1994. That June, Joshua Morrow began portraying Nick, and has remained in the role ever since. The character was reintroduced with the purpose of developing a relationship with another character, Sharon Collins, who was introduced around the same story arc. The pairing, which yielded three children, Cassie, Noah and Faith Newman, proved popular with viewers. They are regarded as a prominent supercouple by the soap opera media. In 2005, the character underwent a dramatic change in storyline when the role of Nick and Sharon's fourteen-year-old daughter Cassie was killed off after a car accident. This led Nick to seek comfort in the arms of another woman, Phyllis Summers, which resulted in an affair. Phyllis became pregnant with Nick's child, Summer Newman. Nick divorced Sharon and married Phyllis the following year. For years, however, Nick battled between his ongoing feelings with Sharon and Phyllis. His other storylines have included trying to seek independence away from his powerful father as well as multiple other relationships. In 2013, a storyline regarding Summer's paternity was visited, centered on speculation that she is actually the daughter of Jack Abbott, Phyllis' ex-husband. Morrow regards Nick as a ""good dude"" who has a ""fiery"" protective personality, which has developed into a ""more mature"" persona as the character grew. Nick and Morrow gained a significant amount of crazed fan attention and popularity during the late 1990s, considered a long-time fan favorite by TV Guide. The pairing of Nick and Sharon has been met with notable success, listed as one of the genre's best supercouples by The Huffington Post and SoapNet, among other sources.

Later during the second season, Sydney reveals an opportunistic nature during her first blackmail scheme. Following this story, the character gained a reputation for having a playful and uninhibited side. Throughout a good deal of the third season, Sydney is more often presented as a victim, being subjected to much mistreatment and stress. While continuing to endure, she finds support from unexpected people, and later attempts to help others during a chaotic event. The series' fourth season returns the character to her clever and scheming ways, though she is presented more as comedic relief during a period of rather serious story lines, and continues to display a compassionate side. In the fifth season, following years of romantic interests, she appears to finally obtain a fulfilling but short-lived relationship. Afterward, at her wedding, she is seemingly killed after being hit by a car, but reappears alive in the spin-off. In the latter series, Sydney is revealed to have a daughter named Violet.

"Bardolph is a fictional character who appears in four plays by William Shakespeare. He is a thief who forms part of the entourage of Sir John Falstaff. His grossly inflamed nose and constantly flushed, carbuncle-covered face is a repeated subject for Falstaff's and Prince Hal's comic insults and word-play. Though his role in each play is minor, he often adds comic relief, and helps illustrate the personality change in Henry from Prince to King. In early published versions of Henry IV, Part 1, the character is called Rossill or Sir John Russel. Shakespeare renamed the character to avoid suggestions that he was ridiculing the then-prominent Russell family, which included the Earls of Bedford. Bardolph is thought to be named after Thomas Bardolf, 5th Baron Bardolf (d. 1408), one of the rebels affiliated with the insurrection of Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland. In Henry V, Bardolph participates in the war (the Hundred Years' War) and is good friends with Pistol and Nym. By this stage he has been promoted to the rank of lieutenant. After the Fall of Harfleur (1415), he is charged with looting, having been discovered stealing from a church in the conquered French town. He is sentenced to punishment of death by hanging. In a focal point of Henry V, King Henry, despite being friends with Bardolph in his youth, remorselessly agrees to his punishment and has him hanged."

"Pokkali (Malayalam: പൊക്കാളി) is a unique saline tolerant rice variety that is cultivated using extensive aquaculture in an organic way in the water-logged coastal regions, spread in about 5000 hectares area in Alappuzha, Thrissur and Ernakulam districts of Kerala in Southern India. The brand Pokkali has received a GI tag from the Geographical Indications Registry Office, Chennai. Its resistance to salinity is remarkable. The rice is cultivated from June to early November when the salinity level of the water in the fields is low. From mid-November to mid-April, when the salinity is high, prawn farming takes over. The prawn seedlings, which swim in from the sea and the backwaters after the rice harvest, feed on the leftovers of the harvested crop. Sluice gates are used to control the water flow to the fields. The rice crop, which get no other fertilizer or manure, draw nutrients from the prawns’ excrement and other remnants. Since the tidal flows make the fields highly fertile, no manure or fertilizer need to be applied; the seedlings just grow the natural way. In order to survive in the water-logged field, the rice plants grow up to 130-140 cm. But, as they mature, they bend over and collapse with only the panicles standing upright. Harvesting takes place by end-October. Only the panicles are cut about 30 cm from top and the rest of the stalks are left to decay in the water, which in time become feed for the prawns that start arriving in November–December. Then, the second phase of the Pokkali farming, the prawn filtration, begins. The organically-grown Pokkali is famed for its peculiar taste and its high protein content. Farmers claim that the rice—its grains are extra large—has several medicinal properties. In the past, Pokkali provided the energy to fishermen to stay at sea all day. Even a DNA library has been developed by the University of Arizona, USA, for the rice."
"The Great French Wine Blight was a severe blight of the mid-19th century that destroyed many of the vineyards in France and laid waste to the wine industry. It was caused by an aphid that originated in North America and was carried across the Atlantic in the late 1850s. The actual genus of the aphid is still debated, although it is largely considered to have been a species of Daktulosphaira vitifoliae, commonly known as grape phylloxera. While France is considered to have been worst affected, the blight also did a great deal of damage to vineyards in other European countries. How the Phylloxera aphid was introduced to Europe remains debated: American vines had been taken to Europe many times before, for reasons including experimentation and trials in grafting, without consideration of the possibility of the introduction of pestilence. While the Phylloxera was thought to have arrived around 1858, it was first recorded in France in 1863, near the former province of Languedoc. It is argued by some that the introduction of such pests as phylloxera was only a problem after the invention of steamships, which allowed a faster journey across the ocean, and consequently allowed pests such as the Phylloxera to survive the trip. Eventually, following Jules-Émile Planchon's discovery of the Phylloxera as the cause of the blight, and Charles Valentine Riley's confirmation of Planchon's theory, Leo Laliman and , two French wine growers, proposed that the European vines be grafted to the resistant American rootstock that were not susceptible to the Phylloxera. While many of the French wine growers disliked this idea, many found themselves with no other option. The method proved to be an effective remedy. The ""Reconstitution"" (as it was termed) of the many vineyards that had been lost was a slow process, but eventually the wine industry in France was able to return to relative normality."

"Alleppey Green Cardamom is a green variety of kiln dried Cardamom capsule grown in Cardamom Hills of Idukki district in Kerala. This cardamom variety is called Alleppey cardamom not because it's grown in Alleppey, Kerala rather it's because Alleppey was the main depot through which this cardamom was processed in erstwhile Travancore. In 18th century kings of Travancore brought state monopoly over trade and export of cardamom. The understanding between kings with British Raj, Travancore–Dutch Wars,consolidation of power under Marthanda Varma with British aid etc. were the reasons why such monopoly had come. This made all produce of cardamom in Travancore state to be sold solely to the state depot at Alleppey. Back then Alappuzha was the major port in Travancore. This led to development of cardamom sorting and processing in Alleppey which resulted the naming of the most high quality cardamom produce from the region as Alleppey Green Cardamom. Post rise of Kochi market and port, Independence of India, Travancore–Cochin merger the relevance and existence of a port in Alleppey became a thing of past. Today the development of better processing facilities, abundance of raw material, skilled cheap labour and allied infrastructure etc. in Idukki had resulted in complete shifting of the processing industry out of Alappuzha. Alleppey cardamom has a unique quality. It is kiln dried and has superior sensory quality, uniform shade of green and a three cornered ribbed appearance."

"The Thaddeus Hait Farm is located on Allhusen Road near the hamlet of Modena in the town of Plattekill, New York, United States. It is a 142-acre (0.57 km2) property on both sides of the road consisting of 15 contributing properties in two distinct groups, together comprising a mostly intact early 19th-century family farm still used for that purpose today. Hait, a member of a prosperous Westchester County family, bought the original 97 acres (39 ha) in 1819. At the time the road was the busy Milton Turnpike, carrying much traffic from distilleries. Over the next nine years, he built the farm up with purchases adding 35 acres (140,000 m2), setting it into its present form. His grandson sold it in 1888. Two other owners later, in 1906, the Allhusen family after whom the road was renamed bought it for dairy farming and kept it until 1973. After some more transitional owners, it came to the Adairs, who returned to the property's roots by going into winemaking. The farm was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. They have since sold the property to Marc and Lori Stopkie, who have retained the Adair name. Today, Adair Vineyards produces 20,000 bottles annually of Seyval blanc, Vignoles, Foch and Millot, on 100 acres (40 ha). Their tasting facility is on the south side of the road east of the house. The main house, on the road a short distance from the Shuart-Van Orden Stone House, is a Federal style home built around 1825 from a mix of wood and stone, an unusual combination in that style. A frame extension of the west wing was added in the late 19th century. Originally the front was sided in clapboard with a cornice and frieze; that was replaced with cedar in the 1950s. The interior retains much of the original molding. Near the house are ancillary agricultural structures, such as a stone barn (an unusual material for the area) that appears to have built around the same time as the house, a later wood barn of an identical configuration as the first. The other group, south of the road, is centered on a New World Dutch barn, older than the main house. Originally constructed, like other Dutch barns, for wheat farming, it was adapted for winemaking around 1986. Its outbuildings include a smokehouse, icehouse and 1873 granary. An outhouse dates to the early 20th century. There is also the remains of a foundation of a late 18th or early 19th-century stone house and a well that served it."

Armagan Champagne Cellars purchased the business in 1984, and the Amador County vineyard and wine cellar were sold to the Sobon family in 1989. Thus, bottles sold under the D'Agostini label are produced by Armagan, but the wine produced from the original vines comes from Sobon.

"The production of wine in New Jersey has increased significantly in the last thirty years with the opening of new wineries. Beginning in 1981, the state legislature relaxed Prohibition-era restrictions and crafted new laws to facilitate the growth of the industry and provide new opportunities for winery licenses. Today, New Jersey wineries are crafting wines that have earned recognition for their quality from critics, industry leaders, and in national and international competitions. As of 2019, New Jersey currently has 51 licensed and operating wineries with several more prospective wineries in various stages of development. According to the United States Department of Agriculture's 2012 Census of Agriculture, the state's wineries and vineyards dedicated 1,082 acres to the cultivation of grapes. New Jersey wineries are growing Vitis vinifera, Vitis labrusca, or French hybrid wine grapes, and producing or offering for sale over eighty types of wines. In 2010, 1.72 million gallons (approximately 716,000 cases) of wine were produced by New Jersey wineries; making it the seventh largest wine-producing state in the United States. A considerable portion of New Jersey wine sales are non-grape fruit wine, particularly apple, blueberry, raspberry, and cranberry wines. These fruits are associated with New Jersey and can be purchased from many nearby farms throughout the Garden State. New Jersey's 51 wineries generate between US$30,000,000-$40,000,000 of revenue annually. Wealthy New Jersey landowners began to produce wines during the colonial period. In 1767, two men, Edward Antill and William Alexander, Lord Stirling received recognition for their successful efforts to cultivate grapes and produce wine on their plantations from the Royal Society of Arts in London. The Society had challenged colonists in Britain's North American colonies to cultivate grapes and produce ""those Sorts of Wines now consumed in Great Britain."" While the cultivation of grapes and fruit trees supported a flourishing wine industry in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the effects of Prohibition (1919-1933) and a legacy of restrictive laws constraining the industry's recovery subsequent to its repeal, practically devastated the industry. For fifty years after the repeal of Prohibition, New Jersey was limited by law to a ratio of one winery license for every 1,000,000 state residents, which by 1980 effectively allowed for only seven wineries. The growth of the state's winery industry has been bolstered by the repeal, starting in 1981, with the New Jersey Farm Winery Act, of many Prohibition-era laws and allowed many small growers to open new wineries."
"California wine production has a rich viticulture history since 1680 when Spanish Jesuit missionaries planted Vitis vinifera vines native to the Mediterranean region in their established missions to produce wine for religious services. In the 1770s, Spanish missionaries continued the practice under the direction of the Father Junípero Serra planted California's first vineyard at Mission San Juan Capistrano. Its contemporary wine production grew steadily since the end of Prohibition, but mostly known for its sweet port-style and jug wine products. As the market favored French brands, California’s table wine business grew modestly, but quickly gained international prominence at the Paris Wine Tasting of 1976, when renown French oenophiles, in a blind tasting, ranked the California wines higher than the primer French labels in the Chardonnay (white) and Cabernet Sauvignon (red) categories. The result caused a ‘shock’ in viticulture industry since France was regarded as foremost producer of the world's finest table wines. This revolutionary event attributed to expanding the recognition and prestige of vintners in the New World, specifically, the Golden State. The state produces about ninety percent of the American wine supply and is the fourth largest wine producer among the world's independent nations. It has more than 1,200 wineries ranging from home-grown and small boutiques to large corporations with international distribution."

It had held this distinction since Prohibition."
"Château Lafite Rothschild is a wine estate in France, owned by members of the Rothschild family since the 19th century. The name Lafite comes from the surname of the La Fite family. Lafite was one of four wine-producing châteaux of Bordeaux originally awarded First Growth status in the 1855 Classification, which was based on the prices and wine quality at that time. Since then, it has been a consistent producer of one of the world's most expensive red wines."
"Castello di Amorosa is a winery located near Calistoga, California. The winery opened to the public in April 2007, as the project of a fourth-generation vintner, , who also owns and operates the V. Sattui Winery named after his great-grandfather, Vittorio Sattui, who originally established a winery in San Francisco in 1885 after emigrating from Italy to California. The winery property was once part of an estate owned by Edward Turner Bale. In 1993, Sattui purchased 171 acres (69 ha) for $3.1 million, then spent another $40 million to construct the castle, outbuildings, and the winery inside the castle; construction work began in 1995. During the Glass Fire that began on September 27, 2020, the farmhouse suffered major damage, the entire 2020 vintage of the wine Fantasia was lost, but the castle was left unharmed."
"Château Ksara is a wine company in Beqaa Valley Lebanon. Founded in 1857 by Jesuit priests. Château Ksara developed the first dry wine in Lebanon.

"Spoto Family Wines is an ultra-boutique winery in Sacramento, California that is owned and operated by the Spoto Family. The winemaker, Stuart Spoto, makes Bordeaux-style blends with grapes from the Oakville Station (part of the historic vineyard) in Oakville (the heart of the Napa Valley). Stuart's grandfather, Enrico Rodolfo Spoto, Sr., immigrated to the United States on December 1, 1913 from Catania, Sicily at the age of 15. He moved to California, where he started a family and ran a fruit and nut tree nursery. His son, Henry Spoto, Jr., a first generation Italian-American, taught himself to make wine. At the age of 16, Henry's son Stuart expressed an interest in the process. Henry, at the time a Cal-Trans appraiser, made wine only in his spare time. Over time, Henry began spending more time making wine and seeking advice from the experts at the University of California at Davis' Viticulture and Enology Department. In the early years, Henry and Stuart learned the techniques and chemistry necessary to make good wines. Stuart later attended the University of California at Davis and studied chemical and civil engineering. Winemaking became a hobby for both men, and in 2000, they began creating their own individual vintages. In 2004, Stuart built and licensed the first bonded winery in a residential neighborhood in Sacramento County. This allowed Stuart to sell his wines. By 2010, Stuart took the wine business on full-time. In November 2010 Spoto Family Wines was invited to be a member of the Oakville Wine Growers Association which promotes the Oakville AVA as the premier Cabernet region in the US. A year later Spoto Family Wines was granted membership into the Napa Valley Vintners, an organization that promotes the wines from the Napa Valley region. The whole family is involved with the winery. Stuart's wife Christy is an integral part of the day-to-day operations and production at the winery. Stuart's oldest daughter, Arianna, graduated in 2011 from California Polytechnic University at San Luis Obispo with a degree in wine and viticulture. She has worked with the wine distribution, and is currently working in the industry in Napa Valley and Australia. His youngest daughter, Alexi, manages the winery's public relations and social media accounts. Spoto Family Wines were served at two major wine events in 2012: The Napa Valley Auction where Spoto Family Wines was part of a live auction item raising $150k for charity and a Taste of Oakville at Carnegie Hall where Spoto poured his wines in the historic Carnegie Hall in New York.

After prohibition the winery fell into a dilapidated state and the winery was abandoned. The Hagen House and the vineyards have since been restored after they were bought by and Julio Palmaz in 1997. The family operated winery and vineyards cultivate some 55 acres using sustainable farming practices, devote to Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Riesling, Muscat along with smaller plantings of Merlot, Malbec, Cabernet Franc and Petite Verdot. Palmaz Vineyards is noted for having the largest wine cave in the Napa Valley, totaling 100,000 square feet. Palmaz Vineyards' winemaking and aging takes place within the living rock of Mount George, in a multi-leveled series of tunnels and domes. The height of the wine cave is equivalent to an 18-storey building, providing the vertical range needed for true gravity-flow winemaking. Thus, the wine is not subjected to the violent agitation of pumping, which can change the wine’s intra-molecular structure. This gentle treatment allows finer nuances of flavor to develop naturally. The fermentation dome is the world’s largest underground reinforced structure. It is 72’ in diameter and 54’ high. Temperature stays constant at 60 degrees and humidity at 75%, the perfect atmosphere for aging wine. The cave houses its own water treatment plant built to comply with strict conservation guidelines.

"Voyager Estate is an Australian winery located in the Margaret River wine region of Western Australia. James Halliday, ""Australia’s leading wine writer"" as described by Jancis Robinson MW, gives the winery his highest ranking, five red stars, in his ""Halliday Australian Wine Companion"" According to Ray Jordan, wine writer for The West Australian, the winery produces excellent wines. The Voyager Estate property lies in the cool meso-climate of Stevens Valley within the greater Wallcliffe sub-region of the Margaret River. This wine region is virtually unique in Australia in that it is surrounded on three sides by the Indian Ocean. The vines benefit from the maritime climate. The land is part of the Leeuwin's Naturaliste Ridge, rising from ancient granite land mass 2,000 million years old, among the world's oldest soils. The Margaret River region has a low mean annual temperature range and in terms of rainfall, a Mediterranean climate with a low annual rainfall between October and April. In a dry vintage it is very similar in climate to Pomerol and Saint Èmilion in Bordeaux. This location, long regarded as key growing area for the finest Margaret River Chardonnay has also developed a reputation for producing elegant Cabernet Sauvignon and other Bordeaux varieties. Both Leeuwin Estate and Xanadu Wines are located nearby; along with Voyager, they are considered the region's most acclaimed wineries and form the nucleus of the ‘Golden Triangle of Chardonnay’. Voyager Estate's Cape Dutch-style tasting room and rose garden are major tourist attractions, and the winery is also known for its restaurant, named the best Regional Restaurant of the Year for 2018 by the WA Good Food Guide Awards.

He purchased 40ha (99 acres) in the Stevens Valley after having read research done by Dr. Harold Olmo and Dr. John Gladstones, both of whom believed the Margaret River region had tremendous potential to grow grapes. “There was a lot of talk around the area that we were climatically similar to Bordeaux."" said Gherardi, ""So I planted Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, a little bit of Cabernet Franc and then the Bordeaux whites, Sauvignon Blanc, Semillon and also Chenin Blanc."" These original vineyard blocks still surround the winery's cellar door, and the four additional vineyards of Voyager Estate are planted on well drained gravelly soils on adjoining properties. The property was purchased in 1991 by Australian businessman Michael Wright, who renamed it Voyager Estate. Wright was a teetotaler who loved agriculture and the Margaret River region. His environmental consciousness was paired with a fanatical attention to detail in the vineyards. At the time of his death in 2012, the property had grown to 110ha (270 acres), all farmed following a “balanced and sustainable” form of viticulture, drawing upon organic principals and using organic composts and seaweed extracts to replace commercial fertilizer. Following Wright's passing, his daughter Alex Burt (née Wright) took over ownership of the property. She continues her father's careful, environmental approach to viticulture and winemaking, and two-thirds of its vineyards currently meet Australian Certified Organic standards, with the final third to be certified in 2019. Steve James, Manager of Winemaking and Viticulture, began working for Voyager Estate as a viticulturalist and has been instrumental in the property's conversion to organic farming. His interest in all aspects of wine production carries over to the entire team, with winemakers and viticulturists working together over the course of the year to make sure that they are able to make best use of each vineyard and each block. Integrated pest control management is used, all pruning, leaf plucking, shoot tinning and green harvesting is done by hand, and flocks of local sheep are brought in to trim weeds. A similar light-touch approach is utilized in the vinification. Grapes are hand-harvested and pass through a sorting table in order to ensure that only the highest-quality grapes are processed. Each block is handled separately until blending. Natural yeast is used in the white wines, and only the free-run juice is retained for the Estate Chardonnay, resulting in an elegant wine that reflects its vineyard source. Only tight-grained French oak barrels are used in the èlevage, adding finesse to the finished wine without taking over as the primary characteristic of the wine. In addition to being widely available in Australia, Voyager Estate wines are exported to the United Kingdom, the United States, Singapore, China, Canada, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, Kenya, Denmark, and Germany."

"The Picchetti Winery, also known as the Picchetti Ranch, is a winery located at 13100 Montebello Rd., Cupertino, California in the Picchetti Ranch Open Space Preserve. The Picchetti brothers, Secondo and Vincenzo, for whom the ranch was named, were among the earliest settlers to plant grapes on this ridge, which they named ""Monte Bello"" or ""beautiful mountain."" This ridge was later to become one of Santa Clara County's important vineyard areas. The complex is composed of seven buildings built between 1880 and 1920, which retain their original design details. Vincenzo and Secondo Picchetti settled on Montebello ridge in 1877 and purchased an initial 160 acres (65 ha) for $1,500. The ranch expanded to 500 acres (200 ha) by 1904. The first house on the property was built around 1882, followed by a larger residence in 1886. Both homes, plus the stone winery, were in the Picchetti family until 1976. The first grapes planted were Zinfandel, Carignane and Petite Sirah. At first, the brothers only sold the grapes to local wineries, but in 1896 they decided to make their own wine, becoming one of the early wineries in California (California Bonded Winery number 148). Instrumental in establishing the in 1892, Vincenzo served on the first school board and supplied a room for a teacher at his ranch. Vineyards were the life blood of the town of Cupertino's early economy, although grape parasites destroyed many of the vines in the region in the 1890s. Upon Vincenzo's death in 1904, sons Antone and John ran the winery and ranch. The front porch of the main house was once screened in and acted as an aviary. Later John had numerous aviaries built - one of those aviaries still stands in front of the homestead house. Commercial wine production ceased in 1963 due to a lack of profitability, and much of the land was sold to the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District.

"The Marsovin Ltd. is Malta's largest producer of premium wine, pressing approximately 50% to 55% of locally grown grapes. It was founded in 1919 and is situated in Paola . The high standard of Marsovin wines is attributed partly to Malta’s favourable climatic conditions but also to the stringent controls maintained by experts from the viticultural aspect to the vinification process in order to ensure that the optimum level of quality is achieved. Such quality has also been recognised by independent parties through the years when Marsovin wines have been put to the test by participating in international competitions and awarded gold, silver and bronze medals. Such competitions include Efffervescents du Monde, International Wine Challenge, Challenge du Vin, Emozioni del Mondo amongst others. Today, Marsovin owns 199.7 tumoli of land which make up their five Estates, testimony to Marsovin’s commitment to the culture of wine. These Estates are owned by Marsovin and the Cassar family and are specifically intended for the production of premium quality, single-estate wines. Over the recent years Marsovin has also introduced several wines into its portfolio all of which are produced from contracted land, owned by Maltese and Gozitan who produce grapes according to Marsovin’s specifications, Marsovin currently contracts a total of 1116 tumoli/125 hectares. Marsovin has an extensive variety of brands in its portfolio from table wines all the way through to Single Vineyard, Methode Traditionnelle and high profile sweet wines. Due to the fact that Marsovin has been established from so many years, since 1919, the winery has been in the fortunate position where it could slowly build up an extensive range of wines for different palates and budgets. These wines are classified either as table wines, I.G.T Maltese islands, D.O.K Malta or Gozo, D.O.K Superior, Single Vineyard Estate wines and Boutique wines. Marsovin has been the pioneer in wine making in Malta during the course of its history. In the early 70’s Marsovin was the first to come out with a Mono varietals range of wines, which at the time stood as Malta’s most premium wine. In the early Marsovin planted its largest ever vineyard in the south of Malta, Marnisi between Żejtun and Marsaxlokk. This vineyard then produced two wines of noble character, Antonin and Marnisi both of which well known in Malta as two of the leading premium red wines on the island. Following this Marsovin moved onto its next great achievement, the production of the first ever Brut, methode classique from the chardonnay grape variety, Cassar De Malte. This project started off in 1997 to then be launched at the Millennium. Needless to say that in between these great milestones for the winery, Marsovin also introduced other very significant brands such as Grand Maitre which was launched in 1999, this wine today is recognized by many wine enthusiasts on the island as Malta's most distinguished premium red wine. Marsovin is the only wine maker in Malta that produces sparkling wine. The Cassar de Malte is vinified using the same procedures of the methode traditionnelle used to create champagne. This Marsovin wine takes its name from the wine-making family, in keeping with tradition. It is made from Chardonnay grapes harvested from the family’s private 15-tumolo estate in Wardija, where there are 7,500 vines. No more than 8,000 bottles are produced from each harvest, and the process takes more than two years, including two fermentations and 15 months in which the bottles are left to lie on lees, allowing the conversion of yeast into sediment. The bottles are placed on special racks called pupitres where they are turned by hand every day for four weeks in a process called riddling or remuage in French, so that the sediment collects in the neck, from where it is finally removed to allow the addition of the liqueur d’espedition, which determines its classification as Brut. Today Marsovin has a presence in the United States of America, Japan, China, Hong Kong and ships directly to end-consumers worldwide."

As of 2005, it sold 3.2 million cases of wine per year, about half in Greece and half abroad. The company was founded in 1895 by Vassilis Kourtakis, one of the first Greeks to formally study oenology. For the first part of its history it focused on retsina shipped in bulk to tavernas around the country. At Vassilis's retirement, the company was taken over by his son, Dimitris Kourtakis, who had studied oenology in Dijon, France. Dimitris introduced a line of bottled Kourtaki retsina, initially in 500-mL bottle-cap-topped bottles, and later also in 750-mL cork-topped bottles. This became very popular during the 1960s and 1970s; at its peak it was selling 60 million bottles per year, and propelled the company to market dominance. Dimitri's son, Vassilis Kourtakis, took over on his father's retirement, and began diversifying the company into styles other than retsina, partly as a result of the downturn in retsina's popularity. As part of this process, he introduced a number of new brands alongside the Kourtaki brand. Apelia was introduced as a line of low-cost table wines, while Kouros was introduced as a high-end brand (it became the first Greek wine featured on a non-Greek airline's wine list when Lufthansa added it).

"The garagistes refers to a group of winemakers in the Bordeaux region, producing ""vins de garage"", ""garage wine"". A group emerged in the mid-1990s in reaction to the traditional style of red Bordeaux wine, which is highly tannic and requires long ageing in the bottle to become drinkable. The garagistes developed a style more consistent with perceived international wine tastes. For red wines this means ""bigger, bolder, fruitier wines, often with sometimes a higher alcohol content."" The new style for white wines is a more pronounced oak taste with some residual sugar. This new style of wine is controversial, and purists claim that the wines will not age well and they don't reflect well the terroir of the region, nor the typicity of the grape varieties used. Characterised as ""winemaker's wine whose attributes reflect a disregard for the traditional handling of its particular terroir"", the term is sometimes used somewhat as a backhanded compliment; in light of this, vins de garage wines come from previously unknown estates without proven track record or pedigree. Alternately, such wine is referred to as ""super-cuvée"" or ""microchâteau"". The wines produced by these estates often receive very high wine ratings from Robert Parker, and are usually sold at prices driven high by rarity, hyperbole, and fashion."

The Collio extends from the Judrio river in the west, where it borders the Colli Orientali del Friuli DOC, to the Slovenian border on the east. To the south, it is bordered by the Isonzo del Friuli DOC. Most of the region's vineyards are centered on the comune of Cormons. The soil of the region is composed of calcareous marl and flysch sandstone. The 4th largest DOC in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia in terms of areas planted, it is also the 4th leading producer in terms of volume, trailing the Friuli Grave, Isonzo and Colli Orientali del Friuli region in production. Over 85% of the Collio production is in white wine grape varieties. While still low in comparison to the rest of Italy, the yields in the Collio Goriziano are higher than the 3.5 tons an acre average of the Friuli-Venezia Giulia.

Today, winemaking on the region is very technologically advanced with refrigerated fermentation tanks, pneumatic wine presses, and centrifugal bottling systems. The objective of most Collio Goriziano winemakers is to maximize the fresh fruit and pure varietal characteristic of the grape. To that extent, oak influence is not widely used in this region though some winemaking are experimenting with its use and different blends of grape varieties to produce more complex wine."

Despite its historic name it is currently no longer part of the federal-state of Hesse, this being the case since the end of World War II. There have been several unsuccessful attempts to legally reunite the former wine growing districts of Mainz on the Hessian side during the post-war area. Rheinhessen produces mostly white wine from a variety of grapes, particularly Riesling, Müller-Thurgau and Silvaner, and is best known as the home of Liebfraumilch, although some previously underrated Rieslings are also made, increasingly in a powerful dry style. The wine region is a member of the Great Wine Capitals Global Network."
"Mittelrhein (or Middle Rhine) is a region (Anbaugebiet) for quality wine in Germany, and is located along a 120 km stretch of river Rhine in the tourist portions of the Rhine region known as Middle Rhine. On the left bank of Rhine, vineyards begin immediately downstream of the Nahe estuary and last until Koblenz. On the right bank, vineyards begin where Rheingau ends and last until 8 kilometers south of Bonn, in the Siebengebirge. Parts of the Rhine Gorge, a UNESCO World Heritage since 2002, make up the southern part of Mittelrhein. The region's 448 hectares (1,110 acres) of vineyards (2013 situation) are dominated by white wine grapes (85%) to a higher extent than any other wine region of Germany with the exception of Mosel. With the much-appreciated Riesling being the most grown variety at 68% of the vineyards, and considering the vicinity to the world-famous regions Rheingau and Mosel, it could perhaps be expected that Mittlerhein would enjoy a commercial success. In reality, the situation is quite the opposite. In between 1989 and 2009 the Middle Rhine lost 36% of its total area of vines under cultivation, while the nationwide development shows a plus of 7.37% Since the region's planted area has been shrinking for quite some time, the region's wines are hardly ever seen on export markets, and seem to be rather unknown even inside Germany. The underlying reasons are manifold. The must per hectare comparison of German wine growing regions shows that in average, the Middle Rhine ranks 3rd lowest in output per hectare with an average of 68 hl / ha between 2001 and 2012. Only Saale-Unstrut (56 hl/ha) and Saxony (45 hl/ha) yield a lower output. The nationwide average over the same time frame comes up to 91 hl/ha. Hence, in a ten-year average, the Middle Rhine region only yields 75% of the nation’s average hectolitre per hectare output. In 2012, the output per hectare was 59 hl / ha, hence even 13% less than the ten year average of the region and 35% less than the average national output for 2012. In 2013, there were greater difficulties for harvesting and production. The bad weather conditions throughout the year led to minimal output, especially for late ripening grapes like Riesling, by far the most grown variety. Many quality producers only harvested 30 hl / ha, and some producers less. Despite these low yields, the region's wines in the 2013 vintage were of a high quality, and prices remained stable and low. From countless conversations to wine growers in and outside the area, the conclusions on the underlying reasons are various. On one side, the area is vulnerable to the climate conditions of the respective vintage year; on the other side, there is an ongoing trend to forfeit quantity for the sake of quality. The most hyped wineries all over the world get worked up on only selecting the best grapes by hand. Due to the region’s geological conditions, this is usual practice on the Middle Rhine. The difference: Prices don't quadruple because of this fact."
"Vinho Verde (Portuguese: [ˈviɲu ˈveɾðɨ]) (literally 'green wine') refers to Portuguese wine that originated in the historic Minho province in the far north of the country. The modern-day 'Vinho Verde' region, originally designated in 1908, includes the old Minho province plus adjacent areas to the south. In 1976, the old province was dissolved. Vinho Verde is not a grape variety, it is a DOC for the production of wine. The name means ""green wine,"" but translates as ""young wine"", with wine being released three to six months after the grapes are harvested. They may be red, white, or rosé, and they are usually consumed soon after bottling. A Vinho Verde can also be a sparkling, a Late Harvest or even Brandy. In its early years of production, the slight effervesce of the wine came from malolactic fermentation taking place in the bottle. In winemaking this is usually considered a wine fault but Vinho Verde producers found that consumers liked the slightly fizzy nature. However, the wines had to be packaged in opaque bottles to hide the unseemly turbidity and sediment that the ""in-bottle MLF"" produced. Today, most Vinho Verde producers no longer follow this practice with the slight sparkle being added by artificial carbonation. The region is characterized by its many small growers, which numbered around 19,000 as of 2014. Many of these growers used to train their vines high off the ground, up trees, fences, and even telephone poles so that they could cultivate vegetable crops below the vines that their families may use as a food source."
"The Loire Valley wine region includes the French wine regions situated along the Loire River from the Muscadet region near the city of Nantes on the Atlantic coast to the region of Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé just southeast of the city of Orléans in north central France. In between are the regions of Anjou wine, Saumur, Bourgueil, Chinon, and Vouvray. The Loire Valley itself follows the river through the Loire province to the river's origins in the Cévennes but the majority of the wine production takes place in the regions noted above. The area includes 87 appellations under the Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC), Vin Délimité de Qualité Superieure (VDQS) and Vin de pays systems. While the majority of production is white wine from the Chenin blanc, Sauvignon blanc and Melon de Bourgogne grapes, there are red wines made (especially around the Chinon region) from Cabernet franc. In addition to still wines, rosé, sparkling and dessert wines are also produced. With Crémant production throughout the Loire, it is the second largest sparkling wine producer in France after Champagne. Among these different wine styles, Loire wines tend to exhibit characteristic fruitiness with fresh, crisp flavors-especially in their youth. The Loire Valley has a long history of winemaking dating back to the 1st century. In the High Middle Ages, the wines of the Loire Valley were the most esteemed wines in England and France, even more prized than those from Bordeaux."
"Savoy (French: Savoie) is a wine region situated in the Savoy region in eastern France, and is sometimes referred to as the country of the Allobroges. The Savoy landscape is distinctly alpine. Between lakes and mountains, the Savoy vineyards hang from slopes or clutch at hillsides in little islands that produce their special growth, from Fréterive in the South, to Evian in the North, passing through Apremont and Jongieux. With grape varieties Jacquère, Roussanne, Altesse (also known as Roussette) and Gringet for white wines, and Mondeuse for the reds, Savoie is characterised by a number of varieties which are very rare elsewhere. The Savoyard appellations (labels) are distributed through four departments: Haute-Savoie, Ain, Isère and Savoie. Crépy near Lake Geneva and Seyssel in the Ain are easy to locate. But wines labelled Roussette de Savoie and Vin de Savoie can come from anywhere in the wine growing area, unless the label display the name of a village in addition to the appellation. There are 4 Roussette villages: Frangy, , and . And there are no fewer than 17 ""Vin de Savoie"" villages, the most well known being Apremont, Chignin, and Arbin."
"The Rhône wine region in Southern France is situated in the Rhône valley and produces numerous wines under various Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) designations. The region's major appellation in production volume is Côtes du Rhône AOC. The Rhône is generally divided into two sub-regions with distinct vinicultural traditions, the Northern Rhône (referred to in French as Rhône septentrional) and the Southern Rhône (in French Rhône méridional). The northern sub-region produces red wines from the Syrah grape, sometimes blended with up to 20% of white wine grapes, and white wines from Marsanne, Roussanne and Viognier grapes. The southern sub-region produces an array of red, white and rosé wines, often blends of several grapes such as in Châteauneuf-du-Pape."
"Franconia (German: Franken) is a region for quality wine in Germany situated in the north west of Bavaria in the district of Franconia, and is the only wine region in the federal state of Bavaria. In 2014, vines were grown on 6,176 hectares (15,260 acres) of land in the region."
"Ahr is a wine region (Anbaugebiet) for quality wine in Germany, and is located in the valley of the river Ahr, a tributary of Rhine, and is situated in the federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate. With only 558 hectares (1,380 acres) of vines as of 2008, it is one of smaller of Germany's 13 regions. Despite its northern location (it is for example situated north of Mosel region) it primarily produces red wines, and red grape varieties account for 86% of the vineyard area, which is more than in any other German wine region."
"The Colli Orientali del Friuli is a Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) located in the Italian wine region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia. The region is located in the province of Udine and is sub-divided into three main sections; Ramandolo in the north, and Corno di Rosazzo. The climate and soil is very similar to the neighboring DOC of Collio Goriziano and the two region share many winemaking similarities as well. The main distinction between the Colli Orientali del Friuli and Collio Goriziano lie in the increased red and dessert wine production of the Colli Orientali del Friuli. The region also includes within its boundaries the three Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) of the Friuli-Venezia Giulia Ramandolo and the two passito wine DOCGs of Colli Orientali del Friuli Picolit and Colli Orientali del Friuli Picolit-Cialla."
"The Valle d'Aosta DOC (or Vallée d'Aoste DOC, in French) is an Italian denominazione di origine controllata located in the Aosta Valley of northwest Italy. Surrounded by the Alps, the Valle d'Aosta is home to the highest elevated vineyards in all of Europe. The principal winemaking region of the Valle d'Aosta is found along the eastern banks of the Dora Baltea (fr., Doire baltée) river with the city of Aosta serving as the central winemaking location. The region is divided into three main vineyard areas; the upper valley, Valdigne, the central valley (locally Valle centrale in Italian, Vallée centrale in French) and the lower valley, (locally Bassa valle in Italian, Basse vallée in French). To the south is the winemaking region of Piedmont. The Valle d'Aosta is Italy's smallest winemaking region both in terms of size and production with only about 330,000 cases produced annually in the region and only 36,000 cases produced under the DOC label. Seventy five percent of the area's production is red wine made mostly from the Pinot noir, Gamay and Petit Rouge varieties. A white wine is made from the indigenous Prié blanc grape by the cooperative of Blanc de Morgex et de La Salle."
"The territory of Franciacorta, from Latin ""franchae curtes"", which means ""exempted from paying duties"", is a section of the Province of Brescia in the Italian Region of Lombardy. Franciacorta extends from Mount Orphan in the southwest area to the shores of Lake Iseo in the north, and from the river Oglio in the western border to the city of Brescia in the eastern one. The physical conformation characterised by rolling hills was shaped by glacial action. The area has been inhabited since Palaeolithic times with archaeological records left by Gauls— the Cenomani of Brixia (modern Brescia), Romans and Lombards. The name Franciacorta, attested in 1277, is thought to derive from curtes francae, the fortified courts of the Frankish empire established in the 8th century. The most respected wine producers of Franciacorta's sparkling and still wines are: Berlucchi, Bellavista and Ca' del Bosco. Others include Mosnel, Muratori, Lantieri, Majolini, Ferghettina and Cavalleri. To promote enotourism the district established the ""Strada del Vino Franciacorta"" on the model of the famed German Wine Route (Weinstraße) in 2001. Finally, the local circuit has hosted the World RX of Italy and the NASCAR Whelen Euro Series."
Beira Interior is a Portuguese wine Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) located in central Portugal in the Beiras VR wine region. It was created in 2005 when three Indicação de Proveniencia Regulamentada (IPR) regions were put together into one DOC.
"Bucelas (historically known as Bucellas) is a Portuguese wine-region located in the Lisboa wine-region. The region has Portugal's highest wine classification as a Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC). Located south of the Arruda DOC, the region is noted for its potential for cool fermentation white wine production. Vineyards in the area are planted on predominantly loam soils. The white wines of Bucelas became widely popular during the Elizabethan era in England and again during the Victorian age. In London the wines were sometimes described as Portuguese hock because of their similarities to the German Rieslings from the Rhine. Urban sprawl in the 20th century has drastically reduced viticulture in the area, located north of the Portuguese capital city, Lisbon."
"Moscatel de Setúbal is a Portuguese muscatel produced around the Setúbal Municipality on the Península de Setúbal. The region is known primarily for its fortified Muscat wines known as Moscatel de Setúbal. The style was believed to have been invented by José Maria da Fonseca, the founder of José Maria da Fonseca, the oldest table wine company in Portugal dating back to 1834. J.M. Fonseca company still holds a quasi-monopoly control over the production of Moscatel de Setúbal today."
"The Açores VR (Portuguese: Açores Vinho Regional) is a Portuguese wine region located in the archipelago of the Azores. This region is classified as a Vinho Regional (VR), which corresponds to table wines with a geographical indication under European Union wine regulations, similar to a French vin de pays region."
"The Pico IPR is a Portuguese wine region located on the island of Pico in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores. The region is designated a second-tier Indicação de Proveniencia Regulamentada (IPR) classification, and potentially may be reclassified as a product of Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC). The region is primarily known for fortified wines and historically for the UNESCO designation associated with the Landscape of the Pico Island Vineyard Culture."
"Dão is a Portuguese wine region situated in the Região Demarcada do Dão with the Dão-Lafões sub region of the Centro, Portugal. It is one of the oldest established wine regions in Portugal. Dão wine is produced in a mountainous region with a temperate climate, in the area of the Rio Mondego and Dão rivers in the north central region of Portugal. The region became a Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) appellation in 1990. The Dão region is the origin of the Touriga Nacional vine that is the principal component of port wine."
"Palmela is a Portuguese wine region centered on the town of Palmela in the Setúbal Peninsula subregion. The wine region has the Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) status after having been elevated from its former Indicação de Proveniencia Regulamentada (IPR) status. At the same time, the former Arrábida IPR, centered on the Arrabida hills, was absorbed into Palmela DOC. Palmela first gained attention for its off dry white wines made from Muscat grapes harvested early but has recently turned its attention to producing dry red and white table wines. The soil of the area of the former Arrábida IPR is predominantly limestone with good drainage potential for the cultivation of red wine varieties."
"Colares is a Portuguese wine region centered on the Colares municipality in Estremadura region. The region has Portugal's highest wine classification as a Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC). Located along the southwestern Atlantic coast, vineyards in the area are protected from the strong ocean winds by sandy dunes. In 1940s, vineyards covered 2,500 acres but have since been reduced by suburbanization to 50 acres. Between 1934 and 1994, only the local co-op could use the Colares appellation. Because grapevines there are grown directly upon the sand, and phylloxera aphids cannot live on sand, Colares vineyards are some of the only European vines that are not grafted upon American rootstocks. The ungrafted Ramisco vines of the Colares region are some of the oldest in Portugal. The region is known for its deep colored, full bodied red wines that are high in astringent tannins."
"Algarve is a Portuguese wine region covering the same areas as its namesake region. The region is classified as a Vinho Regional (VR), a designation similar to a French vin de pays region. Located on the southern coast of Portugal, the region's wine industry is driven by the local tourist economy with very few wines being exported."
"Alentejo (Vinho do Alentejo, Alentejo wines) is a Portuguese wine region in the Alentejo region. The entire region is entitled to use the Vinho Regional designation Alentejano VR, while some areas are also classified at the higher Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) level under the designation Alentejo DOC. VR is similar to the French vin de pays and DOC to the French AOC. In the southern half of Portugal, the Alentejo region covers about a third of the country and is sparsely populated. In 2005, South Oregon University scientist Gregory V. Jones identified Alentejo (""southern Portugal"" in his words) as the world's most challenged wine region (out of 27 world wine regions) from a climate change perspective. The region is noted for it vast cork production but has in recent years garnered attention for its table wine production. Some producers of this region still do wine in great potteries as in Roman times."
"Torres Vedras is a Portuguese wine region centered on the town of Torres Vedras in the Lisboa wine region. The region is designated as Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) after it was promoted from its former Indicação de Proveniência Regulamentada (IPR) status. The high yields produced in this region have historically be used by bulk wine producers for inexpensive vindo de mesa wines. The area was known by the shorthand ""Torres"" until Spanish wine producer Miguel A. Torres objected to the association with the region."
"Tavira is a Portuguese wine region centered on the Tavira Municipality in the Algarve region. The region has Portugal's highest wine classification as a Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC). Extending to the Spanish border, the region is flanked on the west by the Lagoa DOC."
Óbidos is a Portuguese wine region centered on the town of Óbidos in the Lisboa region. The region is designated as Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) after it was promoted from its former Indicação de Proveniencia Regulamentada (IPR) status in 2006. The region produces both red and white wines with the white wines being traditionally used for distilled beverages.
Arruda is a Portuguese wine region centered on the town of Arruda dos Vinhos in the Lisboa wine region. The region is designated as Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) after it was promoted from its former Indicação de Proveniencia Regulamentada (IPR) status. The region is known primarily for its red wine production.
"Encostas d'Aire is a Portuguese wine region located on the limestone hills extending across the northern end of the wider Lisboa wine region into the southwestern corner of the Beiras region. The region was initially an Indicação de Proveniencia Regulamentada (IPR) region, but in 2005, it was elevated to Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) status, and at the same time the Alcobaça IPR was merged into Encostas d'Aire to form a subregion. Despite similar names, the Encostas d'Aire DOC is quite distinct from the former Encostas da Nave IPR located in the northern half of the Beiras region, which is now part of Távora-Varosa DOC and no longer used on wine labels, reducing the risk of confusion."
"Minho, formerly Rios do Minho, is a Portuguese wine region covering the same areas as the Vinho Verde DOC. The region is classified as a Vinho Regional (VR), a designation similar to a French vin de pays region. The wines of the Minho and Vinho Verde are nearly identical except for the Minho VR allowing foreign grape varieties to be used that are excluded from the Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) regulations for Vinho Verde."
"Tejo, until 2009 named Ribatejo, is a Portuguese wine region covering the same areas as the Ribatejo Province. It takes its name from the river Tejo (Tagus). The entire region is entitled to use the Vinho Regional designation Tejo VR, while some areas are also classified at the higher Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) level under the designation DoTejo DOC. VR is similar to the French vin de pays and DOC to the French AOC. Located between the Lisboa and Alentejo VRs, the region is dominated by the influence of the Tagus river. The river moderates the region's climate, making it more temperate than other areas of Portugal. Vineyards are planted on the fertile alluvial plains along the river and can be prone to producing excessive yields. In 2009, the region was renamed from Ribatejo to Tejo, the same name as the river flowing through the region, as part of a drive to increase the wine region's international reputation. However, the DOC has kept its name Ribatejo, which removed the previous problem of having the same name applied to wines at two different levels of classification."
"Península de Setúbal, until 2009 named Terras do Sado, is a Portuguese wine region covering Península de Setúbal and most of the Sado River region. The area is classified as a Vinho Regional (VR), a designation similar to a French vin de pays region. With the Setúbal DOC to the northwest and the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the region is almost completely surrounded by the Alentejo VR. In 2009, the region was renamed from Terras do Sado to Península de Setúbal, to associate the region's name with the name of its internationally most well-known subregion, Setúbal."
"Alcobaça is a Portuguese wine region centered on the town of Alcobaça in the Estremadura region. The region was initially an Indicação de Proveniencia Regulamentada (IPR) region, but in 2005 it became one of two subregions of the Encostas d'Aire DOC, which has Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) status. Its name may still be indicated together with that of Encostas d'Aire, as Encostas d'Aire-Alcobaça. The region produces predominantly white wines with lower alcohol levels then it neighboring wine regions on in Estremadura."
"Carcavelos is a Portuguese wine region centered on the Carcavelos municipality in Estremadura region and includes land near the cities of Cascais and Oeiras. The region has Portugal's highest wine classification as a Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC). Located at the very southern tip of the Estremadura region, the region has a long winemaking history dating back to the 18th century when Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of Pombal owned vineyards here. The region is known for its fortified wine production, creating off dry, topaz colored wines that have nutty aromas and flavors. While once a thriving wine region, world-renowned in the 19th century for its tawny colored fortified wine, in the modern era Carcavelos has been devastated by real estate development in the suburbs of the capital city of Lisbon and nearby coastal city of Estoril."
"Távora-Varosa is a Portuguese wine region located in the northwestern section of the Beiras region. The region is designated as Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) after it was promoted from its former Indicação de Proveniencia Regulamentada (IPR) status, when it was called Varosa IPR. At the same time, the former Encostas da Nave IPR, bordering the Douro, was absorbed into the Távora-Varosa DOC. The white wines of Távora-Varosa have traditionally been used by Portuguese sparkling wine producers as part of a base cuvée, while the wines of the former Encostas da Nave IPR are very similar to the wines of the Douro region."
"Trás-os-Montes is a Portuguese wine region located in the Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro region. The entire wine region is entitled to use the Vinho Regional designation Transmontano VR, while some areas are also classified at the higher Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) level under the designation Trás-os-Montes DOC. VR is similar to the French vin de pays and DOC to the French AOC. Located in the northeastern corner of Portugal, the Trás-os-Montes region has vineyards across a wide range of altitudes that produces a vast spectrum of wine. The vineyards in the cooler high altitude produces wines that are light bodied while the lower altitude region produces full bodied, highly alcoholic wines. One of the first wines to gain international attention was the semi-sweet, semi-sparkling wine known as rosado. Douro DOC, which is famous as the Port wine region, is also located in Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro and could use the former Trás-os-Montes VR designation. However, with the creation of a separate Duriense VR, Douro vineyards are now separate from both the Trás-os-Montes DOC and Transmontano VR."
"Chaves is a Portuguese wine region centered on the town of Chaves in the Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro region. The region was initially a separate Indicação de Proveniencia Regulamentada (IPR) region, but in 2006, it became one of three subregions of the Trás-os-Montes DOC, which has the higher Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) status. Its name may still be indicated together with that of Trás-os-Montes, as Trás-os-Montes-Chaves. Located along the Tamega river, the region produces light bodied wines that are similar in style to wines produces in the Douro DOC."
"Cartaxo is a Portuguese wine region centered on the town of Cartaxo and overlapping the Estremadura and Ribatejo VR regions. The region was initially a separate Indicação de Proveniencia Regulamentada (IPR) region, but in 2003, it became one of six subregions of the Ribatejo DOC, which has the higher Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) status.

Portimão is a Portuguese wine region centered on the Portimão municipality in the Algarve region. The region has Portugal's highest wine classification as a Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC). The region is bordered by the Lagoa DOC to the east and the Lagos DOC to the west.
"Alenquer is a Portuguese wine region centered on the town of Alenquer in the Lisboa wine region. The region is designated as Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) after it was promoted from its former Indicação de Proveniencia Regulamentada (IPR) status. Located in a valley in the district of Lisboa, wine grapes are able to ripen easily and produce full bodied red wines that have a spicy, peppery aroma. The white wines tend to be dry with a creamy mouthfeel."
"Lagos is a Portuguese wine region centered on the Lagos municipality in the Algarve region. The region has Portugal's highest wine classification as a Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC). Located on the southwestern corner of Algarve, the region is bordered to the east by the Portimão DOC."
"Lisboa, until 2009 named Estremadura, is a Portuguese wine region covering the same areas as the Estremadura region, and taking its name from the country's capital. The region is classified as a Vinho Regional (VR), a designation similar to a French vin de pays region. While the Beiras and Alentejo VRs are largest geographically, the Lisboa region is Portugal's largest producer of wine by volume. The region stretches from Lisbon along the Atlantic coast to the Bairrada DOC. In early 2009, the region was renamed from Estremadura to Lisboa to avoid confusion with the Spanish wine region Extremadura and to capitalize on the internationally well-known name of the country's capital."
Lagoa is a Portuguese wine region centered on the Lagoa municipality in the Algarve region. The region has Portugal's highest wine classification as a Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC). The region is bordered to the west by the Portimão DOC and to the east by Tavira DOC.

"Bairrada is a Portuguese wine region located in the Beira Litoral Province. The region has Portugal's highest wine classification as a Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC), and its popularity has surged over the last years. It is small and quite narrow coastal region, part of the broader region of Beira Atlântico, and it is bordered to the northeast by the Lafões IPR and to the east by the Dão DOC. It is located close to the Atlantic which ocean currents have a moderating effect on the climate, resulting in a mild, maritime climate with abundant rainfall. The region is hilly, but the majority of the vineyards are placed on flatter land. About 2/3 of the national sparkling wine production takes place in this region, and in recent years the city of Anadia received the nickname of ""Capital do Espumante"", which translates to ""Sparkling Wine Capital"". The region is also known for its deep colored tannic red wines, that often have bell pepper and black currant flavors, as well its emerging rosé production. The boundaries of the Bairrada DOC includes the municipalities of Anadia, Cantanhede, Mealhada and Oliveira do Bairro."
"Napa County wine is wine made in Napa County, California, United States. County names in the United States automatically qualify as legal appellations of origin for wine produced from grapes grown in that county and do not require registration with the United States Department of the Treasury Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.The vast majority of Napa County is covered by the boundaries of the world-famous Napa Valley AVA, an American Viticultural Area, and its various sub-appellations. The portion of the county that falls outside of the boundaries of the Napa Valley AVA is northeast of the Chiles Valley AVA, where few grapes are cultivated. Few wines are produced that carry a Napa County appellation of origin designation, as almost every wine produced from grapes grown in the county is eligible for release with the more commercially profitable Napa Valley AVA designation. The most common use of Napa County on a wine label is when a wine has been produced from grapes grown in two or more counties, such as Sonoma County and Napa County. In such a case, the wine label must indicate what percentage of grapes were sourced from each county."
"Montepulciano d'Abruzzo is an Italian red wine made from the Montepulciano wine grape in the Abruzzo region of east-central Italy. It should not be confused with Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, a Tuscan wine made from Sangiovese and other grapes. Montepulciano d'Abruzzo was first classified as Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) in 1968. The Colline Teramane subzone, established in 1995 as a DOC in the province of Teramo, was promoted to separate Denominazione di origine controllata e garantita (DOCG) status in 2003 and is now known as Colline Teramane Montepulciano d'Abruzzo.In the late 20th and early 21st century, Montepulciano d'Abruzzo earned a reputation as one of the most widely exported DOC wines in Italy.It is typically dry with soft tannins and often consumed young. In addition to Montepulciano, up to 15% Sangiovese is permitted in the blend. Wines aged by the maker for more than two years may be labeled Riserva."
"The Colli Piacentini (""Hills of Piacenza"") is an Italian wine region located at the western end of Emilia-Romagna. In 1967, it was given the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) quality designation. Within its boundaries are several smaller DOCs including Colli Piacentini Gutturnio, Monterosso Val D'Arda DOC, Trebbianino Val Trebbia DOC and Val Nur del Colli Piacentini DOC. The region has a long history of winemaking with fossilized vine roots and grape seeds excavated from the region showing viticulture taking place as early as 2000 BC. In Roman times, Julius Caesar's father-in-law Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, grew grapes in the Piacenza hills. The Colli Piacentini was once considered part of the Piedmont wine region. To the northwest is the Lombardy wine region of Oltrepò Pavese and, like Oltrepò Pavese, the wine industry of the Colli Piacentini has had strong historical ties to the wine markets of Milan. The region produces over 17 different wines ranging from Vin Santo dessert wines to slightly sparkling frizzante wines. While the practice of labeling wines by varietal is more often associated with New World wines, winemakers in the Colli Piacentini are permitted by DOC regulations to label some of their wines by varietal."
"Portuguese wine is the result of traditions introduced to the region by ancient civilizations, such as the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, and mostly the Romans. Portugal started to export its wines to Rome during the Roman Empire. Modern exports developed with trade to England after the Methuen Treaty in 1703. From this commerce a wide variety of wines started to be grown in Portugal. And, in 1758, one of the first wine-producing regions of the world, the Região Demarcada do Douro was created under the orientation of Marquis of Pombal, in the Douro Valley. Portugal has two wine-producing regions protected by UNESCO as World Heritage: the Douro Valley Wine Region (Douro Vinhateiro) and Pico Island Wine Region (Ilha do Pico Vinhateira). Portugal has a big variety of local kinds, producing a very wide variety of different wines with distinctive personality."

"Fort Berens Winery, aka Fort Berens Estate Winery, is a winery and vineyard based in Lillooet, British Columbia, Canada. Located in East Lillooet, near the site of the never-built Hudson's Bay Company's Fort Berens, it is the first successful attempt at a commercial winery in the area in the 20th Century and has won numerous awards for its wines. It is the only commercial winery so far in the newly designated , though there are established local vinyards which are non-commercial and a history of wine cultivation at nearby Fountain. It was founded by Rolf de Bruin, who immigrated to Canada with his family in 2008 from the Netherlands with his wife Heleen Pannekoek and their family. They chose Lillooet over the Okanagan because land values there were a quarter what they were in the Okanagan, which is the centre of the BC wine industry. Though the winery's first commercial vintage was made from grapes and wine brought in from the Okanagan, their first bottles made from grapes grown only in Lillooet were opened on April 30, 2012. The winery first started operations in 2009."

"Pisoni Estate is a family-owned and operated vineyard and winery located in the Santa Lucia Highlands of California’s Monterey Coast. It was founded in 1982 by Gary Pisoni, who was more interested in growing wine grapes than row crops for the family vegetable farm. He decided to plant a vineyard in the mountains above the Salinas Valley--an area previously considered undesirable for growing because of its dry, granitic soil. The vineyard began with small crops of Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Pinot Noir, then eventually focused on the Pinot Noir for which it has become renowned. In the vineyard’s first decade, Gary built its reputation by selling fruit to other vintners. In 1998, the Pisoni family also began to produce a single wine: Pisoni Estate Pinot Noir, which remains the sole wine made under this label. Pisoni Estate now covers 40 acres of the Santa Lucia Highlands AVA, and consists of 30 individually farmed blocks ranging from .5 to 17 acres in size. Pisoni Estate wines were named among America’s Grand Crus by wine critic Robert Parker."

"Greece is one of the oldest wine-producing regions in the world and among the first wine-producing territories in Europe. The earliest evidence of Greek wine has been dated to 6,500 years ago where wine was produced on a household or communal basis. In ancient times, as trade in wine became extensive, it was transported from end to end of the Mediterranean; Greek wine had especially high prestige in Italy under the Roman Empire. In the medieval period, wines exported from Crete, Monemvasia and other Greek ports fetched high prices in northern Europe."
"Pantelleria (Italian pronunciation: [pantelleˈriːa];), the ancient Cossyra or Cossura, is an Italian island and comune in the Strait of Sicily in the Mediterranean Sea, 100 km (62 mi) southwest of Sicily and 60 km (37 mi) east of the Tunisian coast.

"Madeira (/məˈdɪərə/ mə-DEER-ə, US also /-ˈdɛər-/ -⁠DAIR-, Portuguese: [mɐˈðejɾɐ, -ˈðɐj-]), officially the Autonomous Region of Madeira (Portuguese: Região Autónoma da Madeira), is one of the two autonomous regions of Portugal, the other being the Azores. It is an archipelago situated in the North Atlantic Ocean, in a region known as Macaronesia, just under 400 kilometres (250 mi) to the north of the Canary Islands and 520 kilometres (320 mi) west of Morocco. Madeira is geologically located on the African Tectonic Plate, though the archipelago is culturally, economically and politically European. Its total population was estimated in 2016 at 289,000. The capital of Madeira is Funchal, which is located on the main island's south coast. The archipelago includes the islands of Madeira, Porto Santo, and the Desertas, administered together with the separate archipelago of the Savage Islands. The region has political and administrative autonomy through the Administrative Political Statute of the Autonomous Region of Madeira provided for in the Portuguese Constitution. The autonomous region is an integral part of the European Union as an outermost region. Madeira generally has a subtropical climate with mediterranean summer droughts and winter rain. Many microclimates are found at different elevations. Madeira was claimed by Portuguese sailors in the service of Prince Henry the Navigator in 1419 and settled after 1420. The archipelago is considered to be the first territorial discovery of the exploratory period of the Age of Discovery. As of 2017, it was a popular year-round resort, being visited every year by about 1.4 million tourists, almost five times its population. The region is noted for its Madeira wine, gastronomy, historical and cultural value, flora and fauna, landscapes (laurel forest) that are classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and embroidery artisans. The main harbour in Funchal has long been the leading Portuguese port in cruise liner dockings, receiving more than half a million tourists through its main port in 2017, being an important stopover for commercial and trans-Atlantic passenger cruises between Europe, the Caribbean and North Africa. In addition, the International Business Centre of Madeira, also known as the Madeira Free Trade Zone, was created formally in the 1980s as a tool of regional economic policy. It consists of a set of incentives, mainly tax-related, granted with the objective of attracting foreign direct investment based on international services into Madeira."
"Orvieto (Italian: [orˈvjɛːto]) is a city and comune in the Province of Terni, southwestern Umbria, Italy situated on the flat summit of a large butte of volcanic tuff.

"Ischia (/ˈɪskiə/ ISK-ee-ə, Italian: [ˈiskja], Neapolitan: [ˈiʃkjə]) is a volcanic island in the Tyrrhenian Sea. It lies at the northern end of the Gulf of Naples, about 30 kilometres (19 miles) from the city of Naples. It is the largest of the Phlegrean Islands. Roughly trapezoidal in shape, it measures approximately 10 km (6 miles) east to west and 7 km (4 miles) north to south and has about 34 km (21 miles) of coastline and a surface area of 46.3 square kilometres (17.9 sq mi). It is almost entirely mountainous; the highest peak is Mount Epomeo, at 788 metres (2,585 feet). The island is very densely populated, with 60,000 residents (more than 1,300 inhabitants per square km). Ischia is the name of the main comune of the island. The other comuni of the island are Barano d'Ischia, Casamicciola Terme, Forio, Lacco Ameno, and Serrara Fontana. Ischia's main industry is tourism, centering on thermal spas that cater mostly to European (especially German), American and Asian tourists eager to enjoy the fruits of the island's natural volcanic activity, its hot springs, and its volcanic mud."
"Santorini (Greek: Σαντορίνη, pronounced [sandoˈrini]), officially Thira (Greek: Θήρα [ˈθira]) and classic Greek Thera (English pronunciation /ˈθɪərə/), is an island in the southern Aegean Sea, about 200 km (120 mi) southeast from the Greek mainland. It is the largest island of a small, circular archipelago, which bears the same name and is the remnant of a volcanic caldera. It forms the southernmost member of the Cyclades group of islands, with an area of approximately 73 km2 (28 sq mi) and a 2011 census population of 15,550. The municipality of Santorini includes the inhabited islands of Santorini and Therasia, as well as the uninhabited islands of Nea Kameni, Palaia Kameni, Aspronisi and Christiana. The total land area is 90.623 km2 (34.990 sq mi). Santorini is part of the Thira regional unit. The island was the site of one of the largest volcanic eruptions in recorded history: the Minoan eruption (sometimes called the Thera eruption), which occurred about 3,600 years ago at the height of the Minoan civilization. The eruption left a large caldera surrounded by volcanic ash deposits hundreds of metres deep. It may have led indirectly to the collapse of the Minoan civilization on the island of Crete, 110 km (68 mi) to the south, through a gigantic tsunami. Another popular theory holds that the Thera eruption is the source of the legend of Atlantis. It is the most active volcanic centre in the South Aegean Volcanic Arc, though what remains today is chiefly a water-filled caldera. The volcanic arc is approximately 500 km (310 mi) long and 20 to 40 km (12 to 25 mi) wide. The region first became volcanically active around 3-4 million years ago, though volcanism on Thera began around 2 million years ago with the extrusion of dacitic lavas from vents around Akrotiri."

"Tupungato is a department located in the province of Mendoza, Argentina. The cabecera (departmental capital), Tupungato, is located approximately 70 km (43 mi) south of Mendoza city, in the Valle de Uco. Its name comes from the Tupungato volcano (at 6,570 metres, one of Argentina's highest peaks). The volcano's name is said to mean ""star viewpoint"" in the Huarpe language. The department is approximately 1,200 metres above mean sea level, and comprises 2.485 km² (1.6% of the provincial total). According to the 2001 census [INDEC], the total population of the department was 28,539 with a density of 11.48 inhabitants per km². The region is mainly dependent on agricultural production, with vineyards being its most important produce, representing 30% of the planted lands. Other regional products are fruit (mainly peach) and garlic. The wine industry, however, is particularly relevant due to the constant investments and intensive labour occupation. Recent developments in the Argentine economy have further fuelled the Argentine wine industry, attracting foreign investors and tourists to the region."

"Cava (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈkaβa], plural cavas) is a sparkling wine of Denominación de Origen (DO) status from Spain. It may be white (blanco) or rosé (rosado). The Macabeo, Parellada and Xarel·lo are the most popular and traditional grape varieties for producing cava. Only wines produced in the traditional method may be labelled ""cava""; those produced by other processes may only be called ""sparkling wines"" (vinos espumosos). About 95% of all cava is produced in the Penedès area in Catalonia, Spain, with the village of Sant Sadurní d'Anoia being home to many of the largest Catalan production houses. The two major producers are Codorníu and Freixenet. Cava is also produced in other villages in Aragon, Castile and León, Extremadura, La Rioja, Basque Country, Navarre and Valencia. Marketing Cava as ""Spanish champagne"" is no longer permitted under European Union law, since Champagne has Protected Geographical Status (PGS). Colloquially it is still called champán or champaña in Spanish or xampany in Catalan. Today it is defined by law as a ""quality sparkling wine produced in a designated region"" (Vino Espumoso de Calidad Producido en una Región Determinada, VECPRD). The word champán in Spanish is not to be confused with achampañado, a colloquial term for the non-traditional method sparkling wines. These achampañados wines are generally cheaper, are served by the bottle at bars or restaurants specializing in them and hence these establishments are called by the same name, i.e. achampañado. This is not cava, but it is a somewhat popular drink as well."
"Champagne (/ʃæmˈpeɪn/, French: [ʃɑ̃paɲ]) is a sparkling wine produced in the Champagne wine region of France under the rules of the appellation, that demand specific vineyard practices, sourcing of grapes exclusively from designated places within it, specific grape-pressing methods and secondary fermentation of the wine in the bottle to cause carbonation. The grapes Pinot noir, Pinot meunier, and Chardonnay are used to produce almost all Champagne, but small amounts of Pinot blanc, Pinot gris, Arbane, and Petit Meslier are vinified as well. Champagne became associated with royalty in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. The leading manufacturers made efforts to associate their Champagnes with nobility and royalty through advertising and packaging, which led to its popularity among the emerging middle class."
"Ice wine (or icewine; German: Eiswein) is a type of dessert wine produced from grapes that have been frozen while still on the vine. The sugars and other dissolved solids do not freeze, but the water does, allowing for a more concentrated grape juice to develop. The grapes' must is then pressed from the frozen grapes, resulting in a smaller amount of more concentrated, very sweet wine. With ice wines, the freezing happens before the fermentation, not afterwards. Unlike the grapes from which other dessert wines are made, such as Sauternes, Tokaji, or Trockenbeerenauslese, ice wine grapes should not be affected by Botrytis cinerea or noble rot, at least not to any great degree. Only healthy grapes keep in good shape until the opportunity arises for an ice wine harvest, which in extreme cases can occur after the New Year, on a northern hemisphere calendar. This gives ice wine its characteristic refreshing sweetness balanced by high acidity. When the grapes are free of Botrytis, they are said to come in ""clean"". Ice wine production is risky (the frost may not come at all before the grapes rot or are otherwise lost) and requires the availability of a large enough labour force to pick the whole crop within a few hours, at a moment's notice, on the first morning that is cold enough. This results in relatively small amounts of ice wine being made worldwide, making ice wines generally expensive. Ice wine production is limited to that minority of the world's wine-growing regions where the necessary cold temperatures can be expected to be reached with some regularity. Canada is the world's largest producer of ice wines, producing a greater volume of ice wine than all other countries combined, followed by Germany."
"Vino novello, Italian for 'young wine', is a light, fruity, red wine produced throughout Italy. Novello is similar to its French cousin Beaujolais nouveau in taste, body and color, but is produced using several grape varieties with a more liberal fermentation process. While historically released for sale on November 6, Novello is since 2012 available on 30 October."
"White Zinfandel is an off dry to sweet rosé wine which was invented by Sutter Home Family Vineyards winemaker Bob Trinchero in 1948. Originally the result of a stuck fermentation and fortuitous accident, White Zinfandel is made from the Zinfandel wine grape, which would otherwise produce a bold and spicy red wine. As of 2018, Sutter Home White Zinfandel is the no. 1 White Zinfandel, with 29.1 percent dollar share of the $300 million White Zinfandel market and 73.1 percent of the 187 mL White Zinfandel market."
"Oeil de Perdrix (French: [œj də pɛʁdʁi]) is a rosé wine produced in Switzerland. The history of the wine style dates back to the Middle Ages in the Champagne region of France and from there spread to the Canton of Neuchâtel in Switzerland where it would become a popular dry rosé made from pinot noir. The name œil de perdrix means ""partridge's eye"" in French, a reference to the pale pink colour of the eye of a partridge in death throes. Until about a century ago, it was common for vineyards to have the red and white grapes unseparated unlike today where each vineyard has a unique grape. This gave white wine, red wine, and what was called grey wine because the wine was neither white nor red. It is also an old name for very pale rosé wine made not by the saignée method, but by ""pressurage direct"", in which the juice of red grapes is drawn off and fermented with very little contact with the skins. With the modernization of viticulture and separation of grapes, the term Oeil de Perdrix disappeared in France, but remained in the Canton of Neuchâtel in Switzerland. The Canton of Neuchâtel would export Oeil de Perdrix primarily to the German-speaking cantons of Switzerland, but also to other cantons, namely to the cantons of Geneva, Vaud, and Valais. After the Second World War, the latter decided to start producing their own Oeil de Perdrix. When the policy for wine of controlled origin (AOC) in Switzerland began, the Canton of Neuchâtel claimed the sole Oeil de Perdrix AOC, but it was refused; the cantons of Geneva, Vaud, Valais, and Neuchâtel all have the Oeil de Perdrix AOC today. The early origins of the American wine White Zinfandel can be traced to a California winemaker's attempt at making an Oeil de Perdrix–style wine."
"Vin gris (French: [vɛ̃ gʁi]) is a variant of rosé wine made from red grapes, in particular pinot noir. Pinot noir is a black grape, but can also be used to make rosé or white wine. When the grapes are brought to the winery and crushed, the juice is run off and removed from contact with the skin, leaving the color and flavor compounds from the skin behind. The juice is then typically fermented in stainless steel tanks before being bottled shortly after, without any aging in oak barrels. Producing a small volume of Vin gris (or rosé) can also be used as a technique to improve Pinot noir. Removing some clear juice increases the concentration of colors and flavor compounds from the skins in the remaining juice intended for making red wine; the resulting rosé is known as a saignée (bled)."
"Pineau des Charentes, (Pineau Charentais, or simply Pineau) is a regional aperitif of western France, made in the départements of Charente, Charente-Maritime, and (to a lesser extent) Dordogne. While popular within its region of production, it is less well known in other regions of France and somewhat uncommon abroad. It is a fortified wine (mistelle or vin de liqueur), made from either fresh, unfermented grape juice or a blend of lightly fermented grape must, to which a Cognac eau-de-vie is added and then matured. Pineau is also found as a home-made product in the neighbouring Deux-Sèvres and Vendée départements. There is also a similar drink called ""Troussepinette"" that is made in the Vendée, which is often flavoured with pine or fruits such as pear. Elsewhere in France analogous drinks are made (Macvin in Jura, Floc de Gascogne in the Armagnac area; there is also Pommeau, similarly made by blending apple juice and apple brandy), but these products are much less well known nationally and internationally than Pineau."
"Sovetskoye Shampanskoye (Сове́тское шампа́нское, 'Soviet Champagne') is a generic brand of sparkling wine produced in the Soviet Union and successor states. It was produced for many years as a state-run initiative. Typically the wine is made from a blend of Aligoté and Chardonnay grapes. After the Soviet Union dissolved, private corporations in Belarus, Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, and Ukraine purchased the rights to use ""Soviet Champagne"" as a brand name and began manufacturing once again. ""Soviet Champagne"" is still being produced today by those private companies, using the original generic title as a brand name."
"Tavernello is the trade name for an Italian table wine that is widely advertised as Italy's #1 Wine and commercially sold in Italy and internationally by the wine cooperative . It is noted for being the first wine produced in Italy which was sold in a Tetra Pak container and also for its low price (under 2 Euros as of January 2009). The only markets where an exception is made in the packaging of Tavernello wine are in Japan and the UK, where it is sold in traditional wine bottles between 500 and 700 yen / £3.50 and £5 in supermarket chains. While the bottles initially featured a traditional cork, it was recently changed to an aluminum screw top as a cost-saving measure and to ensure long term freshness."
"Vin Santo [vin ˈsanto] (""holy wine"") is a style of Italian dessert wine. Traditional in Tuscany, these wines are often made from white grape varieties such as Trebbiano and Malvasia, though Sangiovese may be used to produce a rosé style known as ""Occhio di Pernice"" or eye of the partridge. The wines may also be described as straw wines since they are often produced by drying the freshly harvested grapes on straw mats in a warm and well ventilated area of the house. (However, several producers dry the grapes by hanging on racks indoors.) Though technically a dessert wine, a Vin Santo can vary in sweetness levels from bone dry (like a Fino Sherry) to extremely sweet. While the style is believed to have originated in Tuscany, examples of Vin Santo can be found throughout Italy and it is an authorised style of wine for several Denominazione di origine controllata (DOCs) and Indicazione geografica tipica (IGTs)."
"Marsala is a fortified wine, dry or sweet, produced in the region surrounding the Italian city of Marsala in Sicily. Marsala first received Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) status in 1969.The European Union grants Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status to Marsala, and most other countries limit the use of the term Marsala to products from the Marsala area. While unfortified wine is also produced in the Marsala region, it does not qualify for the Marsala DOC."
"Brunello di Montalcino is a red DOCG Italian wine produced in the vineyards surrounding the town of Montalcino, in the province of Siena, located about 80 km south of Florence in the Tuscany wine region. Brunello, a diminutive of Bruno (""brown""), is the name that was given locally to what was believed to be an individual grape variety grown in Montalcino. In 1879 the Province of Siena's Amphelographic Commission determined, after a few years of controlled experiments, that Sangiovese and Brunello were the same grape variety, and that the former should be its designated name. In Montalcino the name Brunello evolved into the designation of the wine produced with 100% Sangiovese. In 1980, Brunello di Montalcino was among the four wines awarded the first Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) designation. Today it is one of Italy's best-known and most expensive wines."
"A Chianti wine (/kiˈænti/, also US: /-ˈɑːn-/, Italian: [ˈkjanti]) is any wine produced in the Chianti region of central Tuscany. It was historically associated with a squat bottle enclosed in a straw basket, called a fiasco (""flask""; pl. fiaschi). However, the fiasco is only used by a few makers of the wine as most Chianti is now bottled in more standard shaped wine bottles. In the mid-late 19th century, Baron Bettino Ricasoli (later Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Italy) helped establish Sangiovese as the blend's dominant variety, creating the blueprint for today's Chianti wines. The first definition of a wine area called Chianti was made in 1716. It described the area near the villages of Gaiole, Castellina and Radda; the so-called Lega del Chianti and later Provincia del Chianti (Chianti province). In 1932 the Chianti area was completely redrawn and divided in seven sub-areas: Classico, Colli Aretini, Colli Fiorentini, Colline Pisane, Colli Senesi, Montalbano and Rùfina. Most of the villages that in 1932 were added to the newly defined Chianti Classico region added in Chianti to their names, for example Greve in Chianti, which amended its name in 1972. Wines labelled ""Chianti Classico"" come from the largest sub-area of Chianti, which includes the original Chianti heartland. Only Chianti from this sub-zone may display the black rooster (gallo nero) seal on the neck of the bottle, which indicates that the producer of the wine is a member of the Chianti Classico Consortium, the local association of producers. Other variants, with the exception of Rufina from the north-east side of Florence and Montalbano in the south of Pistoia, originate in the respective named provinces: Siena for the Colli Senesi, Florence for the Colli Fiorentini, Arezzo for the Colli Aretini and Pisa for the Colline Pisane. In 1996 part of the Colli Fiorentini sub-area was renamed Montespertoli. During the 1970s producers started to reduce the quantity of white grapes in Chianti. In 1995 it became legal to produce a Chianti with 100% Sangiovese. For a wine to retain the name of Chianti, it must be produced with at least 80% Sangiovese grapes. Aged Chianti (38 months instead of 4–7) may be labelled as Riserva. Chianti that meets more stringent requirements (lower yield, higher alcohol content and dry extract) may be labelled as Chianti Superiore, although Chianti from the ""Classico"" sub-area is not allowed in any event to be labelled as ""Superiore""."
Mateus is a brand of medium-sweet frizzante rosé wine produced in Portugal.
"Asti (also known as Asti Spumante) is a sparkling white Italian wine that is produced throughout southeastern Piedmont but is particularly focused around the towns of Asti and Alba. Since 1993 the wine has been classified as a Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) and as of 2004 was Italy's largest producing appellation. On an average vintage more than ten times as much Asti is produced in Piedmont than the more well-known Piedmontese red wine Barolo. Made from the Moscato Bianco grape, it is sweet and low in alcohol, and often served with dessert. Unlike Champagne, Asti is not made sparkling through the use of secondary fermentation in the bottle but rather through a single tank fermentation utilizing the Charmat method. It retains its sweetness through a complex filtration process. Another wine called Moscato d'Asti is made in the same region from the same grape, but is only slightly sparkling (frizzante) and tends to have even lower alcohol. On 22 June 2014, Vineyard Landscape of Piedmont: Langhe-Roero and Monferrato was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This landscape covers five distinct wine-growing areas and the Castle of Cavour, an important site both in the development of vineyards and in Italian history."
"Piemonte wine is the range of Italian wines made in the region of Piedmont in the northwestern corner of Italy. The best-known wines from the region include Barolo and Barbaresco. They are made from the Nebbiolo grape. These wines are ideal for storage and a well-aged Barolo for instance may leave a feeling of drinking velvet because the tannins are polished and integrated more and more into the wine. As the wine matures the colour becomes more brownish and rust-red. Other popular grapes used for red wine production are Barbera and Dolcetto. Wine made with the Barbera grape is often fruity, with high acidity. It can be delicate with less tannin than wine made from the Nebbiolo grape. Dolcetto on the other side, is not, as the name indicates, sweet. Dolcetto means ""little sweet one"". (dolce is Italian for sweet). The grape gives fresh and dry red wines with some tannin. The wines made with the Dolcetto grape are typically consumed relatively young. The sparkling wine Asti spumante is made from the Moscato grape. The majority of the area's winemaking take places in the provinces of Cuneo, Asti and Alessandria. The Brachetto is another variety used for making sweet and sparkling red wines. While Turin is the capital of the Piedmont, Alba and Asti are at the heart of the region's wine industry. The winemaking industry of the Piedmont played a significant role in the early stages of the Risorgimento with some of the era's most prominent figures – such as Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour and Giuseppe Garibaldi – owning vineyards in Piedmont region and making significant contributions to the development of Piedmontese wines. The excessively high tariffs imposed by the Austrian Empire on the export of Piedmontese wines to Austrian controlled areas of northern Italy was one of the underlying sparks to the revolutions of 1848–1849."
"Trento DOC (Denominazione di origine controllata) is an appellation for white and rosé sparkling wine made in Trentino, Italy. Trentinos developed this appellation, the second in the world after Champagne, to ensure quality and distinction. Only Chardonnay, Pinot noir, and Pinot Meunier with Pinot blanc are permitted, and they must be grown in a well-defined area within the Province of Trento."
"The wine region of Alsace produces wines under three different Appellations d'Origine Contrôlées (AOCs): Alsace AOC for white, rosé and red wines, Alsace Grand Cru AOC for white wines from certain classified vineyards and Crémant d'Alsace AOC for sparkling wines. This region is the only French wine region allowed to label its wines based on variety (i.e., varietal wines)."
"Limoux wine is produced around the city of Limoux in Languedoc in southwestern France. Limoux wine is produced under four Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) designations: Blanquette de Limoux, Blanquette méthode ancestrale, Crémant de Limoux and Limoux, the first three of which are sparkling wines and dominate the production around Limoux. The main grape of the region is the Mauzac, locally known as Blanquette, followed by Chardonnay and Chenin blanc. In 2005, the Limoux AOC was created to include red wine production consisting of mostly Merlot. Wine historians believe that the world's first sparkling wine was produced in this region in 1531, by the monks at the abbey in Saint-Hilaire."
"Sparkling Shiraz is an Australian wine style. Before the enforcement of appellations d'origine contrôlée, the style was called Sparkling Burgundy. The wine begins as a Shiraz on its first fermentation. Its secondary fermentation takes place in its bottle, or méthode champenoise. The Sparkling Shiraz style has been described as ""uniquely Australian""."
"Txakoli (pronounced [tʃakoˈli]) or chacolí (pronounced [tʃakoˈli]) is a slightly sparkling, very dry white wine with high acidity and low alcohol content produced in the Spanish Basque Country, Cantabria and northern Burgos in Spain. Further afield, Chile is also a minor producer. It is normally served as an aperitif and drunk within one year of bottling as it cannot be stored for longer. The most common, white, variety has a pale green color, but there are red and rosé varieties. When served, it is normally poured into tall glasses from a height, often as an accompaniment to pintxos. It typically has between 9.5-11.5 ABV. The 18th century Palace of Mendibile in Leioa near Bilbao today houses a museum dedicated to txakoli, the , explaining the history of txakoli and with a large collection of machinery used for making it."
"Belaire Rosé is a French sparkling wine produced in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region of the South of France. Officially labelled ""Luc Belaire Rare Rosé,"" the wine is a blend of Syrah, Grenache, and Cinsault grapes typically used in the production of Provencal rosé wines. The brand is owned by niaz the New York-based company Sovereign Brands. The brand's packaging is noteworthy for its opaque black bottles. Rick Ross is one of their major promoters. The brand's range also includes a Brut and Luxe, a demi-sec sparkling wine."
"Crémant de Luxembourg is a sparkling wine from Luxembourg's Moselle district made according to the traditional method (méthode traditionnelle) of sparkling wine production which includes a second fermentation in the bottle followed by nine months of maturation. Only grapes from the best local varieties are used. They must be perfectly healthy, fully ripened, and free of damage from crushing or transportation. The designation Crémant de Luxembourg dates from 4 January 1991 when the Marque Nationale: Appellation contrôlée Crémant de Luxembourg was introduced. A rectangular label on the rear of each bottle testifies to the wine's authenticity and quality based on an examination of its colour, clarity, bouquet and taste. There must be a pressure of at least 4 bar in each bottle. Luxembourg is the only country outside France entitled to use the term ""crémant""."
"Brazil is the third-largest producer of wine in South America, behind Argentina and Chile; production in 2018 was 3.1 million hectolitres (82,000,000 US gal), slightly more than New Zealand. A substantial area is devoted to viticulture: 82,000 hectares (200,000 acres) in 2018, though much of it produces table grapes rather than wine grapes. Better quality wines (Brazilian Portuguese: vinho fino) are produced from the European grapevine Vitis vinifera, and in 2003 only some 5,000 ha (12,000 acres) were planted with such vines. The rest are American vines or hybrid vines, many of which are easier to cultivate under Brazilian growing conditions."
"Postup is a Croatian premium quality red wine produced of the plavac Mali crni grape variety in a limited homonymous area of the Pelješac sub-region of the Middle and South Dalmatia wine growing region. At about 50 ha of the locality Postup, in a good year it is possible to produce about 34,000-40,000 t of grapes (the harvest yield being at most 60%), that is about 2,400 hl of the premium wine postup. In fact, a good year is one when due to the specific micro-climatic conditions a part of the grapes of the variety plavac Mali crni grown at this locality (as well as at the locality called Dingač) over-ripe so that there are about 30% of dry berries, increasing the sugar content and making conditions to produce many other ingredients of importance for the quality of the future wine. Postup wine is characterized by a high content of ethanol (often over 14% vol.) and dry extract (over 30 g/l). The wine has a purple - dark red color with blue reflections, as well as a pleasant and unique fragrance and bouquet. It has always been highly priced at the market and used to be sold as much as four times more expensive than other Dalmatian red wines (apart from dingač, a wine postup is difficult to distinguish from). Postup is classified as the highest standard recognized by the Croatian law - ""Vrhunsko Vino"" (""Premium Quality Wine""). It was the second wine (after dingač) protected as ""Premium Quality"" (1967)."
"Dingač is a Croatian premium quality red wine produced of the plavac mali crni grape variety in a limited homonymous area of the Pelješac sub-region of the Middle and South Dalmatia wine growing region. At about 60ha of the locality Dingač it is possible to produce 2.000 to 3.000 hl a year of the premium wine dingač. The wine has a dark red to purple - dark red color with blue reflections, it is harmonious and full, pleasantly bitterish and astringent. The fragrance and particularly bouquet are marked and unique to that wine. Owing to the presence of dry berries in the grapes of plavac mali crni, in some years the ethanol content is so high that reaches the highest possible values the wine-making yeasts can produce in the natural way. Sometimes the fermentation may halt leaving in the wine some residual sugar, so two wine types are possible - dry and semi-dry. Dingač is classified as the highest standard recognized by the Croatian law - ""Vrhunsko Vino"" (""Premium Quality Wine""). It was the first wine protected as ""Premium Quality"" (1965). The one of Dingač's production pioneers is family Violić."
"Prošek is a sweet dessert wine that is traditionally from the southern area of Dalmatia, Croatia. It is made using dried wine grapes in the passito method. Good quality Prošek is usually much more expensive by volume than other wines due to an average of seven times as many grapes being needed to make the same amount of wine. While it can vary in the maximum amount, the alcohol level needed to be certified as a true dessert wine must be at least 15%. The composition is typically of Bogdanuša, Maraština, and/or Vugava (all native Croatian white grapes) with higher-end versions being a blend of the base white grapes and Plavac Mali (a red Croatian grape)."
"Amarone della Valpolicella, usually known as Amarone (UK: /ˌæməˈroʊneɪ, -ni/, Italian: [amaˈroːne]), is an Italian DOCG denomination of typically rich dry red wine made from the partially dried grapes of the Corvina (45–95%, of which up to 50% could be substituted with Corvinone), Rondinella (5–30%) and other approved red grape varieties (up to 25%). Valpolicella is in the province of Verona, within the large Veneto region near Venice. In Italian, the name Amarone literally means ""the Great Bitter""; originally, this was to distinguish it from the Recioto produced in the same region, which is sweeter in taste."
"Lacryma Christi, (also Lachryma Christi of Vesuvius, literally ""tears of Christ""), is the name of a celebrated Neapolitan type of wine produced on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius in Campania, Italy. White Lacryma Christi is made mainly from Verdeca and Coda di Volpe grapes, with smaller proportions of Falanghina, Caprettone and Greco di Tufo included. Red Lacryma Christi is made from Piedirosso and Sciascinoso grapes. It is also, as archaeologists have discovered, the nearest equivalent to wine drunk by the Ancient Romans, having analysed microscopic residue left on the taps of the casks."
"Barbaresco is an Italian wine made with the Nebbiolo grape. Barbaresco is produced in the Piedmont region in an area of the Langhe immediately to the east of Alba and specifically in the comunes of Barbaresco, Treiso and Neive plus that area of the frazione San Rocco Seno d'Elvio which was once part of the comune of Barbaresco and now belongs to the comune of Alba. It was granted Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) status in 1966 and Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita status in 1980. The wine is often compared with Barolo—another Nebbiolo based wine from the Piedmont area. Though the wines do share many similarities, there are some distinct differences between them."
"Ghemme is a red Italian wine with Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita status produced in the Colli Novaresi viticultural area in the hills of the Province of Novara in Piedmont. It was awarded DOC status in 1969 and received its DOCG classification in 1997. The wine is made primarily from the Nebbiolo grape varietal (known locally as Spanna) and like Gattinara, it may be blended with Uva Rara (known locally as Bonarda di Gattinara) and Vespolina. A minimum of 3 years total aging is required, including a minimum 20 months in wood and 9 months in bottle from November 1 of the harvest year. Riserva is a minimum 4 years total aging, including a minimum 25 months in wood and 9 months in bottle from November 1 of the harvest year."
"Gattinara is a red Italian wine with Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) status produced from Nebbiolo grapes grown within the boundaries of the comune of Gattinara which is located in the hills in the north of the province of Vercelli, northwest of Novara in the Piedmont region. It was awarded DOC status in 1967 and received its DOCG classification in 1990."
"Moscato d'Asti is a DOCG sparkling white wine made from the Moscato bianco grape and produced mainly in the province of Asti, northwest Italy, and in smaller nearby regions in the provinces of Alessandria and Cuneo. The wine is sweet and low in alcohol, and is considered a dessert wine. A related wine, Asti, is produced in the same area from the same grape. Grown in the hilltop town of Asti in Montferrat, Piedmont, Moscato d’Asti is made by small producers in small batches. Moscato is named such because of its earthy musky aroma. The ancient Romans called it the apiana. In the Medieval ages, it was popular, and documents that attest to its presence in Piedmont date as far back as the 14th century. Piedmont winemakers traditionally make this low alcohol wine with Muscat à Petits Grains, also known as Moscato bianco. This petite berry varietal ripens early and produces a wide range of wine styles: light and dry, slightly sweet and sparkling or a rich, honey-like dessert wine."
"Barolo (/bəˈroʊloʊ/, also US: /bɑːˈ-/, Italian: [baˈrɔːlo]; Piedmontese: bareul [baˈrø]) is a red Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) wine produced in the northern Italian region of Piedmont. It is made from the nebbiolo grape and is often described as one of Italy's greatest wines. The zone of production extends into the communes of Barolo, Castiglione Falletto, Serralunga d'Alba and parts of the communes of Cherasco, Diano d'Alba, Grinzane Cavour, La Morra, Monforte d'Alba, Novello, Roddi, Verduno, all in the province of Cuneo, south-west of Alba. Although production codes have always stipulated that vineyards must be located on hillsides, the most recent revision of the production code released in 2010 goes further, categorically excluding valley floors, humid and flat areas, areas without sufficient sunlight, and areas with full-on northern exposures. Barolo is often described as having the aromas of tar and roses, and the wines are noted for their ability to age and usually take on a rust red tinge as they mature. Barolo needs to be aged for at least 36 months after the harvest before release, of which at least 18 months must be in wood. When subjected to aging of at least five years before release, the wine can be labeled as Riserva. In the past, Barolo wines tended to be rich in tannin. It can take more than 10 years for the wine to soften and become ready for drinking. Fermenting wine sat on the grape skins for at least three weeks, extracting huge amounts of tannins and was then aged in large, wooden casks for years. In order to appeal to more modern international tastes, those that prefer fruitier, earlier-drinking wine styles, several producers began to cut fermentation times to a maximum of ten days and age the wine in new French oak barriques (small barrels). ""Traditionalists"" have argued that the wines produced in this way are not recognizable as Barolo and taste more of new oak than of wine. The controversies between traditionalists and modernists have been called the ""Barolo wars"", as depicted in Barolo Boys. The Story of a Revolution, a documentary film released in 2014."
"Soave (/soʊˈɑːveɪ, ˈswɑːveɪ/ soh-AH-vay, SWAH-vay, Italian: [soˈaːve]) is a dry white Italian wine from the Veneto region in northeast Italy, principally around the city of Verona. Within the Soave region are both a Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) zone and since 2001 a Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) designation known as Soave Superiore, with both zones being further sub-divided into a general and Classico designation for the wines produced in the heartland of the Soave region around the sloping vineyards of Verona. Throughout the Soave production zone Garganega is the principal grape variety, though Trebbiano di Soave and Chardonnay are permitted in varying percentages. While most Soave is dry, still wine within the DOC zone a sparkling spumante style is permitted as is the passito Recioto style, that in 1998 was granted its own DOCG designation for grapes grown in the hilly region."
"Bardolino and Bardolino Superiore are Italian red wines produced along the chain of morainic hills in the province of Verona to the east of Lake Garda. Bardolino takes its name from the town Bardolino on the shores of Lake Garda and was awarded Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) status in 1968. The Superiore is a stronger aged wine, and was promoted to Denominazione di origine controllata e garantita (DOCG) status in 2001. The blend of grapes used to produce the wine primarily includes Corvina, Rondinella, and Molinara. Up to 15% of the blend is allowed to include Rossignola, Barbera, Sangiovese, or Garganega, in any combination."
"Alcamo Wine is produced under the DOC classification of Alcamo, Sicily. It is located in the province of Palermo about 30 km. south-west of the city of Palermo and just east of Trapani province. In July 1972, the Alcamo DOC was applied to the wines produced in the nine different towns in the vicinity of Alcamo: Calatafimi, Castellammare del Golfo, Gibellina, Balestrate, Camporeale, Monreale, Partinico, San Cipirello and San Giuseppe Jato. Initially, Alcamo exclusively applied to the white wines produced in the region. It is now also used for the red and rose wines produced in the region (following Local Wine Law 99)."
"Est! Est!! Est!!! di Montefiascone (also known as just Est! Est!! Est!!!) is an Italian wine region centered on the commune of Montefiascone in the province of Viterbo in Lazio. Since 1966, the white Trebbiano and Malvasia bianca-based wines produced within the 1,000 acres (400 ha) of the region can qualify for Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) designation under Italian wine laws. The unusual name of the wine region dates back to a 12th-century tale of a German bishop traveling to the Vatican for a meeting with the pope. The bishop sent a prelate ahead of him to survey the villages along the route for the best wines. The 'wine scout' had instructions to write 'Est' (Latin for 'There is') on the door or on the wall of the inns he visited when he was particularly impressed with the quality of the wine they served so the bishop following on his trail would have known in advance where to make a stop. At a Montefiascone inn, the prelate was reportedly so overwhelmed with the local wine that he wrote Est! Est!! Est!!! on the door. While this tale has been widely repeated, with some variations (such as the event taking place in the 10th century and/or involving a Flemish bishop, attending the coronation of Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor instead of meeting the Pope, etc.), the story is considered by many wine experts, such as Master of Wine Mary Ewing-Mulligan, to be apocryphal. Today, the wine region is known primarily for wine tourism, catering to the visitors of Lake Bolsena north of Rome, with comparatively little Est! Est!! Est!!! di Montefiascone being exported. Among wine critics, the wine often receives mixed opinions with wine experts such as Hugh Johnson and Jancis Robinson describing in The World Atlas of Wine Est! Est!! Est!!! di Montefiascone as ""usually the dullest white wine with the strangest name in the world."" Wine writers Joe Bastianich and David Lynch compares Est! Est!! Est!!! di Montefiascone to the Tuscan wines from Vernaccia di San Gimignano saying that the region's ""...history is more compelling than what's currently in the glass."""
"Vino Nobile di Montepulciano is a red wine with a Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita status produced in the vineyards surrounding the town of Montepulciano, Italy. The wine is made primarily from the Sangiovese grape varietal (known locally as Prugnolo gentile) (minimum 70%), blended with Canaiolo Nero (10%–20%) and small amounts of other local varieties such as Mammolo. The wine is aged for 2 years (at least 1 year in oak barrels); three years if it is a riserva. The wine should not be confused with Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, a red wine made from the Montepulciano grape in the Abruzzo region of east-central Italy."
"Ansonica Costa dell'Argentario is a dry Italian white wine from the region of Tuscany, Italy. Ansonica is made from the Ansonica (Inzolia) grape. The DOC is located on the extreme southern coast of Tuscany and on the island of Giglio. The DOC was created in 1995, and allows for a minimum of 85% Ansonica and a 15% maximum of other white grapes in the blend."
"Although viticulture and the cultivation of grapes for table consumption has a long history in Japan, domestic wine production using locally produced grapes only really began with the adoption of Western culture during the Meiji restoration in the second half of the 19th century. According to data from Japan's National Tax Agency for 2017, approximately 382,000 kiloliters of wine was purchased in Japan, of which two-thirds was imported wine. Of the 102,000 kiloliters of wine domestically produced that year, only a fifth came from domestically grown and harvested grapes. The Agency states the share of Japanese wine, as defined as domestically produced wine from domestically grown grapes, as only 4% of total domestic consumption, or 14,988 kiloliters. Only 58 kiloliters of Japanese wine was exported overseas. The main region for winemaking in Japan is in Yamanashi Prefecture which accounts for approximately a third of domestic production, although grapes are cultivated and wine is also produced in more limited quantities by vintners throughout the country, from Hokkaido in the North to Miyazaki Prefecture on the Southern island of Kyushu."
"Akadama (赤玉), originally Akadama port wine, is a Japanese sweet red wine created in 1907 by Shinjiro Torii, the founder of Suntory. Akadama remains popular amongst all generations and is still found in stores across Japan today. Just like port wine, Akadama is a fortified wine."
"Mexican wine and wine making began with the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, when they brought vines from Europe to modern day Mexico, the oldest wine-growing region in the Americas. Although there were indigenous grapes before the Spanish conquest, the Spaniards found that Spanish grapevines also did very well in the colony of New Spain (Mexico) and by the 17th century wine exports from Spain to the New World fell. In 1699, Charles II of Spain prohibited wine making in Mexico, with the exception of wine for Church purposes. From then until Mexico’s Independence, wine was produced in Mexico only on a small scale. After Independence, wine making for personal purposes was no longer prohibited and production rose, especially in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many other European immigrant groups helped with the comeback of wine in Mexico. However, the Mexican Revolution set back wine production, especially in the north of the country. Wine production in Mexico has been rising in both quantity and quality since the 1980s, although competition from foreign wines and 40% tax on the product makes competing difficult within Mexico. Mexico is not traditionally a wine-drinking country, but rather prefers beer, tequila and mezcal. Interest in Mexican wine, especially in the major cities and tourists areas (along with the introduction into the US on a small scale), has grown along with Mexican wines’ reputation throughout the world. Many Mexican companies have received numerous awards. Various wine producers from Mexico have won international awards for their products. In 2020, the wine Don Leo Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon won gold in the International Cabernet competition (CIDC) and the trophy for the world's best Cabernet. The wine is produced in Parras, Coahuila in the Northwestern region of Mexico. There are three major wine-producing areas in Mexico, with the Baja California area producing 90% of Mexico’s wine. This area is promoted heavily for enotourism with the “Ruta del Vino” (Wine Route), which connects over fifty wineries with the port of Ensenada and the border and the annual Vendimia harvest festival."
"Ausbruch (literal meaning: ""break-out"") or sometimes Ausbruchwein is an Austrian wine term for a quality level in the Prädikatswein category. It is situated between Beerenauslese and Trockenbeerenauslese in requirements, which makes it a sweet dessert wine typically made from grapes affected by noble rot. The minimum must weight requirements for Ausbruch is 30 degrees KMW. The Ausbruch Prädikat exists only in Austria and Hungary, not in Germany. The category was introduced into Austrian wine legislation in 1970, as a legalization of the production method allegedly already used in the area of Rust. Ruster Ausbruch are still the most common Ausbruch wines to encounter; in many other Austrian regions, producers classify their wines as Beerenauslese if they fall short of the Trockenbeerenauslese requirements. Since October 2020, the Ruster Ausbruch is legally protected by the Austrian DAC system of origins as ""Ruster Ausbruch DAC""."
"Sélection de Grains Nobles (SGN) is French for ""selection of noble berries"" and refers to wines made from grapes affected by noble rot. SGN wines are sweet dessert wines with rich, concentrated flavours. Alsace wines were the first to be described as Sélection de Grains Nobles, with the legal definition introduced in 1984, but the term is also seen in some other wine regions France, such as Loire."
"Sauternes is a French sweet wine from the region of the same name in the Graves section in Bordeaux. Sauternes wine is made from sémillon, sauvignon blanc, and muscadelle grapes that have been affected by Botrytis cinerea, also known as noble rot. This causes the grapes to become partially raisined, resulting in concentrated and distinctively flavored wines. Due to its climate, Sauternes is one of the few wine regions where infection with noble rot is a frequent occurrence. Even so, production is a hit-or-miss proposition, with widely varying harvests from vintage to vintage. Wines from Sauternes, especially the Premier Cru Supérieur estate Château d'Yquem, can be very expensive, largely due to the very high cost of production. Barsac lies within Sauternes and is entitled to use either name. Somewhat similar but less expensive and typically less-distinguished wines are produced in the neighboring regions of Monbazillac, Cérons, Loupiac and Cadillac. In the United States, there is a semi-generic label for sweet white dessert wines known as sauterne without the ""s"" at the end and uncapitalized."
Sainte-Croix-du-Mont is an Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) for sweet white wine from the Bordeaux wine region in France.
"Polish wine (Polish: Polskie wino) viticulture and origins have a history dating back to the nation's founding in the tenth century under the Piast dynasty. Like other old world wine producers, many traditional grape varieties still survive in Poland, perfectly suited to their local wine hills. The most popular varieties of grapes for the production of red wine are Regent, Rondo, Pinot Noir, Maréchal Foch, Cabernet Cortis, Tryumf Alzacji, Cascade and Dornfelder. For white wine production, Solaris, Riesling, Seyval Blanc, Pinot Gris, Johanniter, Jutrzenka, Hibernal, Aurora, Bianka, Traminer, Jutrzenka and Siberia are mostly used. Following the Second World War, most wineries were nationalized under the Polish People's Republic communist regime. After the collapse of communism and return to capitalism, the market economy returned, international wine companies moved back in and a period of consolidation followed. Modern wine-production methods have taken over in the larger wineries, and EU-style wine regulations have been adopted, guaranteeing the quality of the wine. Today, wine production in Poland is an industry with 151 officially registered wineries (2016/2017 season) to sell and produce grape table wines in Poland as defined by the national wine laws that came into being in 2008 and were updated later on. Some of the oldest wineries are Winnica Equus, Adoria Vineyards, Winnica Jaworek, Winnica Maria Anna, Winnica Płochockich, Winnica Stara Winna Góra, Winnica Miłosz, Winnica Wzgórza Trzebnickie. There exists a very lively winery and viticulture scene throughout the country with especially strong grouping in the regions near the city of Zielona Góra and in the west of the country, Wrocław in the south-west, Kraków in the south, the Podkarpacie region and Kazimierz Dolny in south-east. There are also a few wineries in the ""Northern Poland"" wine region. Winnica Jura, a new project of establishing a 6 hectare organic vineyard is currently underway near Kraków. Scientists in the American National Academy of Sciences foresee significant global warming in the coming years. As a result, by 2050 Poland may have become a leading global wine producer, while vineyards in the south of Italy and Spain may disappear due to drought."
"Schilcher is a wine produced solely in the Austrian region of Western Styria (Weststeiermark), in the districts of Deutschlandsberg and Voitsberg, sharing a border with Slovenia and Carinthia to the south and west. The Schilcher wine itself is a distinct rosé made from the indigenous Blauer Wildbacher grape. The colour ranges from a light onion tinge to a deep ruby. The grape was once a wild variety which was said to contain alcohol compounds which, in turn, allegedly would induce wild inebriation, hence its colloquial name Rabiatperle - rabid pearl. The name Schilcher originates from the Middle High German word schillern meaning to radiate with colour."
"Cviček is a Slovenian wine from the Lower Carniola region of Slovenia. It is a unique wine, composed of different grape varieties including both white and red grape species. It has a relatively low alcoholic content of 8.5% to 10%. Despite its long history of being known as a sour and poor wine, it has recently become a very popular drink with both local people and visitors to the region."
"Vietnamese wine is wine produced in Vietnam. The area was first cultivated for viticulture during the French colonial rule of the region in the late 19th century. The region's tropical climate was ill-suited for the type of Vitis vinifera that the French colonists were used to and the wine industry turned its attention to fruit wine production. The late 20th century saw a renewed focus on the development of Vitis vinifera with the assistance of from regions like Australia. In 1995, a joint venture with Australian winemakers started an aggressive planting scheme to reintroduce international grape varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay to land that was until recently littered with landmines left over from the Vietnam War."

"Brindisi Rosso is a red DOC (Denominazione di Origine Controllata) wine from the Southern Italian province of Brindisi, in the region of Apulia. The official appellation was granted on November 22, 1979, when a presidential decree was published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale dated April 23, 1980, after lobbying by the firm of Pasquale Medico & Sons and other producers. In recent years the production of this variety of wine has declined considerably (up to 50%), due to the uprooting of vines as a result of incentives from the EU, which has favoured other products. The province of Brindisi has a very long tradition of wine making, largely because Brindisi was the Roman gateway to the East and sold its wine to Rome along with salt and olive oil imported from the empire's Mediterranean provinces."
"Ostuni is a white or rosé style Italian wine awarded Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) status in 1972, in the Province of Brindisi of Apulia. The zone of production of the area is limited to the communes of Ostuni, Carovigno, San Vito dei Normanni, San Michele Salentino and parts of the communes of Brindisi, Latiano and Ceglie Messapica."
"Aglianico del Vulture and Aglianico del Vulture Superiore are Italian red wines based on the Aglianico grape and produced in the Vulture area of Basilicata. Located on volcanic soils derived from nearby Mount Vulture, it was awarded Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) status in 1971. The Superiore was elevated to a separate Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) status in 2011, the only DOCG wine in Basilicata. Although not as famous as other Italian wines, Aglianico del Vulture is considered one of the best red wines of Italy."
"Taurasi and Taurasi riserva are red, still Italian wines based principally on the Aglianico grape variety produced in the Province of Avellino in the Campania region. They were awarded Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) status in 1970 and Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) status in 1993. Produced less than 40 miles (64 km) from the other Aglianico stronghold of Aglianico del Vulture in Basilicata, the volcanic soils of the Taurasi region demonstrate the potential the Aglianico grape has to make wines on par with the Nebbiolo grape of Piedmont and Sangiovese grape of Tuscany. The popularity of the region's wine is a relatively recent phenomenon. Until the early 1990s, there was only one winery (Mastroberardino), producing wine for the export market. By the mid-2000s, there were over 293 producers in the Taurausi zone."
"Franciacorta [frantʃaˈkorta] is a sparkling wine from the Province of Brescia (Lombardy) with DOCG status. It is produced using the traditional method from grapes grown within the boundaries of the territory of Franciacorta, on the hills located between the southern shore of Lake Iseo and the city of Brescia. It was awarded DOC status in 1967, the designation then also including red and white still wines. Since 1995 the DOCG classification has applied exclusively to the sparkling wines of the area."
"Brachetto d'Acqui (Italian: [braˈketto ˈdakkwi]; Piedmontese: brachet d'Àich [braˌkɛt ˈdɑjk]) is a red Italian wine that is classified as a Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) since 1996 and previously a Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) region since 1969. It is produced in the Piedmont wine region around Acqui Terme in the province of Alessandria with some overlap into the province of Asti. The wine is produced from the Brachetto grape, a variety that is believed to be native to Piedmont, and can be still or sparkling with usually some sweetness."
"Cortese di Gavi, or simply Gavi, is an Italian dry white wine produced in a restricted area of the Province of Alessandria, Piedmont, close to the Ligurian border. The wine was awarded DOC status in 1974 and elevated to DOCG in 1998. The name derives from Gavi, the comune at the centre of its production zone, and Cortese, the local variety of grape from which it is exclusively made and whose existence is reported from the 17th century. The current style of production dates to 1876. Cortese di Gavi made from vines within the comune of Gavi may be labeled Gavi di Gavi. Although the DOCG rules allow for sparkling spumante and metodo classico styles, most Gavi is produced as a non-sparkling still wine."
"Malvasia di Castelnuovo Don Bosco is a sweet, sparkling, red or rosé DOC dessert wine produced in the Italian province of Asti from the Malvasia di Schierano grape variety with the optional addition of up to 15% Freisa. The wine is cherry red in colour with an aroma typical of the grape and 'reminiscent of dog roses and scents of red berries.' The flavour is sweet and aromatic with characteristic tannins. It is made in both lightly (frizzante) and fully sparkling (spumante) versions; the regulations also permit it to be made as a still wine."
"The Peace Treaty of Wiener Neustadt was a treaty between the Kingdom of Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire. It was preceded by the and followed by the Peace of Pressburg. It deals with succession issues and ascertains the territory mortgages in Moson, Sopron and Vas counties."
"Mount Etna, or Etna (Italian: Etna [ˈɛtna] or Mongibello [mondʒiˈbɛllo]; Sicilian: Muncibbeḍḍu [mʊnt͡ʃɪbˈbɛɖɖʊ] or a Muntagna; Latin: Aetna; Greek: Αἴτνα), is an active stratovolcano on the east coast of Sicily, Italy, in the Metropolitan City of Catania, between the cities of Messina and Catania. It lies above the convergent plate margin between the African Plate and the Eurasian Plate. It is one of the tallest active volcanoes in Europe, and the tallest peak in Italy south of the Alps with a current height (July 2021) of 3,357 m (11,014 ft), though this varies with summit eruptions. Satellite images reveal that Mount Etna has erupted so much in 2021 that it has grown about 100 feet (30 meters) in height in just six months time, and the southeastern crater is now the tallest part of the volcano. Etna covers an area of 1,190 km2 (459 sq mi) with a basal circumference of 140 km (87 miles). This makes it by far the largest of the three active volcanoes in Italy, being about two and a half times the height of the next largest, Mount Vesuvius. Only Mount Teide on Tenerife in the Canary Islands surpasses it in the whole of the European–North-African region west of the Black Sea. In Greek mythology, the deadly monster Typhon was trapped under this mountain by Zeus, the god of the sky and thunder and king of gods, and the forges of Hephaestus were said also to be underneath it. Mount Etna is one of the world's most active volcanoes and is in an almost constant state of activity. The fertile volcanic soils support extensive agriculture, with vineyards and orchards spread across the lower slopes of the mountain and the broad Plain of Catania to the south. Due to its history of recent activity and nearby population, Mount Etna has been designated a Decade Volcano by the United Nations. In June 2013, it was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites."
"The Kaiserstuhl (German: [ˈkaɪzɐʃtuːl], lit. ""Emperor’s Chair"") is a range of hills in the state of Baden-Württemberg in southwest Germany with a maximum height of 556.6 metres (1,826 ft). It is of volcanic origin and located in the southwest of the state in the counties of Emmendingen and Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald. In terms of natural regions it is considered to be a part of the Upper Rhine Plain."
"The Cru Bourgeois classification lists some of the châteaux from the Médoc that were not included in the 1855 Classification of Crus Classés, or Classed Growths. Notionally, Cru Bourgeois is a level below Cru Classé, but still of high quality (formerly there were additional grades of Cru Artisan and Cru Paysan). Many wine writers consider that there is some overlap in quality between the Classed Growths and the Cru Bourgeois, although also saying that by and large the Classed Growths still represent the best wines. The first Cru Bourgeois list was drawn up by the Bordeaux Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Agriculture in 1932, selecting 444 estates for the classification. The words Cru Bourgeois were widely used on labels by the châteaux so listed, although the classification was never officially ratified. A substantial revision of the classification, dividing it into three tiers, was initiated in 2000 and finalised in 2003. This reduced the number of châteaux listed to 247. Following several legal turns, the 2003 Cru Bourgeois classification was annulled by the French court in 2007, and shortly afterwards all use of the term was banned. In 2010, the Cru Bourgeois label was reintroduced, but in a significantly revised form. It now consists of only one level, and is awarded annually, as a mark of quality, to wines rather than to châteaux, on the basis of an assessment of both production methods and the finished product. Any property in the Médoc may apply. The lists are published approximately 2 years after the vintage, so the 2008 list was published in 2010, and the 2009 list was published in 2011. The 2009 list includes 246 wines."
"Meritage is a name for red and white Bordeaux-style wines without infringing on the Bordeaux (France) region's legally protected designation of origin. Winemakers must license the Meritage trademark from its owner, the California-based Meritage Alliance. Member wineries are found principally in the United States, though increasingly elsewhere."
"Districtus Austriae Controllatus (Latin for Controlled District of Austria), DAC, is a classification for regionally typical quality wine (legal category ""Qualitätswein"") in Austria. It is loosely modelled on the French Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) system, and is coupled with a ripeness-based classification scale that shares a lot of nomenclature with the German Prädikat system. Thus, if a label states the winegrowing region followed by the letter combination “DAC” (e.g. Kamptal DAC) we are talking about a regionally typical quality wine. All Austrian quality wines have a round, red and white striped ""Banderole"" on the capsule, which ensures, that it has been inspected and approved by the government tasting authority and fulfills the requirements for “Qualitätswein”, such as maximum yields per hectare, minimum must weight and alcohol levels and guaranteed origin of the grapes. DACs are created for specific regions to establish clearly the local stylistic profile, in alignment with the French concept of terroir. Like in AOC, DAC wines are labelled only with the regional name and not the varietal unless more than one varietal is allowed. Wines carrying the name of a grape variety or a vintage year must be composed of at least 85% of that grape or vintage, respectively."
"Vin de pays (French: [vɛ̃ də pɛ.i], ""country wine"") was a French wine classification that was above the vin de table classification, but below the appellation d'origine contrôlée classification and below the former vin délimité de qualité supérieure classification. The vin de pays classification was replaced by the Indication Géographique Protégée classification in 2009. Legislation on the Vin de pays terminology was created in 1973 and passed in 1979, allowing producers to distinguish wines that were made using grape varieties or procedures other than those required by the AOC rules, without having to use the simple and commercially non-viable table wine classification. Unlike table wines, which are only indicated as being from France, Vin de pays carries a geographic designation of origin, the producers have to submit the wine for analysis and tasting, and the wines have to be made from certain varieties or blends. Regulations regarding varieties and labelling practices were typically more lenient than the regulations for AOC wines."
"Commandaria (also called Commanderia and Coumadarka; Greek: κουμανδαρία, κουμανταρία and Cypriot Greek κουμανταρκά) is an amber-coloured sweet dessert wine made in the Commandaria region of Cyprus on the foothills of the Troödos mountains. Commandaria is made from sun-dried grapes of the varieties Xynisteri and Mavro. While often a fortified wine, through its production method it often reaches high alcohol levels, around 15%, already before fortification. It represents an ancient wine style documented in Cyprus back to 800 BC and has the distinction of being the world's oldest named wine still in production, with the name Commandaria dating back to the crusades in the 12th century."
"Vino de Pago is a classification for Spanish wine applied to individual vineyards or wine estates, unlike the Denominación de Origen Protegida (DOP) or Denominación de Origen Calificada (DOCa) which is applied to an entire wine region. The Vino de Pago classification was introduced in 2003 by a decision in the Cortes Generales, the Spanish parliament, to help further improve the quality of Spanish wine. As of 2021, there were 20 Vinos de Pago. The quality requirements for a Vino de Pago correspond to those for a DOCa wine, and wine estates that are classified as Vino de Pago are subject to separate requirements rather than those of the wine region where they are located. One of the requirements is that the estate may only use their own grapes for their wines. The Spanish word pago comes from the Latin word pagus, meaning a country district. When introduced, the new regulation met with particular interest in Castilla-La Mancha, where the first Vinos de Pago were created. So far, all Vinos de Pago are located in Aragon, Castilla-La Mancha, Castilla y León, Navarra and Valencia."
"Fino (""refined"" in Spanish) is the driest and palest of the traditional varieties of sherry and Montilla-Moriles fortified wine. They are consumed comparatively young and, unlike the sweeter varieties, should be consumed soon after the bottle is opened as exposure to air can cause them to lose their flavour within hours."
"Orange wine, also known as skin-contact white wine, skin-fermented white wine, or amber wine, is a type of wine made from white wine grapes where the grape skins are not removed, as in typical white wine production, and stay in contact with the juice for days or even months. This contrasts with conventional white wine production, which involves crushing the grapes and quickly moving the juice off the skins into the fermentation vessel. The skins contain color pigment, phenols and tannins that would normally be considered undesirable for white wines, while for red wines skin contact and maceration is a vital part of the winemaking process that gives red wine its color, flavor, and texture."
"Vin jaune (French for ""yellow wine"") is a special and characteristic type of white wine made in the Jura region in eastern France. It is similar to dry fino Sherry and gets its character from being matured in a barrel under a film of yeast, known as the voile, on the wine's surface. Vin jaune shares many similarities with Sherry, including some aromas, but unlike Sherry, it is not a fortified wine. The wine is made from the Savagnin grape, with some of the most premium examples coming from the marl based vineyards in the Château-Chalon AOC. In other French wine regions, there has been experimentation in producing similar style wines from Chardonnay and other local grape varieties using cultured yeast such as the vin de voile wine produced in the Gaillac."
"Resinated wine is a type of wine which derives part of its flavor from exposure to tree resins, most generally pine resin. Prior to the widespread use of barrels in Europe, wine was stored in amphorae, often sealed with Aleppo pine resin. Wines thus sealed were flavored by the resin, and over time this became a feature of the wine itself rather than an unwanted side effect. Though today mainly associated with Greece, resinated wine appears to have been widespread in the past. In his Natural History (book XIV), Pliny the Elder noted that in the modern-day Rhône wine region (near Vienne), the Allobroges produced a highly valued resinated wine. The most common form of resinated wine today is Greek retsina (ρετσίνα), which for over 2000 years has been produced in and exported from Greece, particularly around Attica, Boeotia and Euboea. The European Union treats the name ""retsina"" as a protected designation of origin and a traditional appellation for Greece and parts of the southern regions of Cyprus. A South Australian wine style can be called ""resinated wine"" but not ""retsina""."
"Natural wine refers to a generalized movement among winemakers for production of wine using simple or traditional methods. Although there is no uniform definition of natural wine, it is usually produced without the use of pesticides or herbicides and with few or no additives. Typically, natural wine is produced on a small scale using traditional rather than industrial techniques and fermented with native yeast. In its purest form, natural wine is simply unadulterated fermented grape juice with no additives in the winemaking process. Other terms for the product include low-intervention wine, raw wine, and naked wine."
"Organic wine is wine made from grapes grown in accordance with principles of organic farming, which typically excludes the use of artificial chemical fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides and herbicides. The consumption of organic wine grew at a rate of 3.7 percent over the year ending September 19, 2009, outpacing growth in the consumption of non-organic wine which grew 2% during a similar period. There are an estimated 1500–2000 organic wine producers globally, including negociant labels, with more than 885 of these organic domaines in France alone. The legal definition of organic wine varies from country to country. The primary difference in the way that organic wine is defined relates to the use (or non use) of preservatives, specifically sulfur (sulfur dioxide, sulfites, SO2) during the winemaking process. In the US, no additional sulfites may be added to any organic product, including wine. In the EU, added sulfites are allowed in organic wine and determined by the kind of wine. Most other wine-producing countries do not have their own standards for organic wine and observe the standards of the nation importing the wine. Another difference in the standards between the US and Europe is the additional label ""Made with Organic Grapes."" This label can be used in the US if the grapes used to make the wine are 100% certified organic but the wine has added sulfites (up to 100 parts per million) or uses non-native yeasts. Europe does not have a comparable label."
"A nouveau (English: /nuːˈvoʊ/ French pronunciation: ​[nuvo]), or vin (de) primeur, is a wine which may be sold in the same year in which it was harvested. The most widely exported nouveau wine is French wine Beaujolais nouveau which is released on the third Thursday of November, often only a few weeks after the grapes were harvested. Nouveau wines are often light bodied and paler in color due to the very short (or nonexistent) maceration period followed by a similarly short fermentation. The wines will most likely not be exposed to any oak or extended aging prior to being released to the market. Nouveau wines are characteristically fruity and may have some residual sugar. They are at their peak drinkability within the first year. As of 2005, there were 55 AOCs in France permitted to make nouveau wines. Vins de primeur should not be confused with the practice of buying and selling wines en primeur. In Italy, nouveau wine is called ""Vino Novello""."
"Alazani wine takes its name from one of Alazani River (Georgian: ალაზანი, Azerbaijani: Qanıx), which forms part of the Georgian border with Azerbaijan in eastern Georgia, before flowing into the Kura River. As a result of the slightly warmer climate in the , grapes grown there are sweeter than elsewhere in Georgia. This wine is made from Rkatsiteli grapes (Georgian რქაწითელი; literally ""red stem""). This is one of the oldest variety of grapes in Georgia, with archaeologists having unearthed examples in clay jars from the 3rd millennium BC. Recently Rkatsiteli grapes have been planted in Eastern Europe, the Finger Lakes region of New York and Australia. It has a semi-sweet flavor with light fruit tones and a straw color that darkens as the wine ages. Alazani white wine goes well with fruit, nuts and deserts."
"Coyol wine, or chicha de coyol is a fermented alcoholic beverage made from the sap of coyol palms. It has been made and consumed in Southern Mexico for thousands of years. It is primarily made and consumed in certain regions of Central America like Nicaragua and Honduras Juticalpa in Honduras, Guanacaste Province and Nambí, Nicoya, Costa Rica, and Río San Juan Department and Chontales Department, Nicaragua are all known for their traditions of coyol wine. In order to produce the wine, the trees are cut down and drained of their sap, which is left to ferment in the sun. The result is a cloudy, pale yellow, moderately alcoholic beverage. Coyol wine is most commonly produced and sold by private vendors, often seen selling the drink on the side of country roads and at small kiosks in used plastic bottles that originally contained water, soft drinks, or other similar beverages. Coyol can also be drunk directly from the hole where it collects in the palm trunk, using a straw or a piece of bamboo. The wine is purportedly unique in that it causes inebriation not primarily by its alcohol content, but through enzymatic action triggered when one drinks it and then receives significant sun exposure. It is popularly claimed that one can become inebriated at night, regain sobriety by the next day, and then undergo inebriation again in the morning without consuming any more, merely by being exposed to the sun again."
"The modern Indian Wine market is small but growing; annual per capita consumption of wine in the country is a mere 9 milliliters, approximately 1/8000th that of France. The main reason for this can be attributed to the fact that Indians preference for hard liquor and beer boasts nearly 98% of market share whereas wine with low ABV only has 2% market share. The Viticulture in India has a long history dating back to the time of the Indus Valley civilization when grapevines were believed to have been introduced from Persia. Winemaking has existed throughout most of India's history but was particularly encouraged during the time of the Portuguese and British colonization of the subcontinent. The end of the 19th century saw the phylloxera louse take its toll on the Indian wine industry followed by religious and public opinion moving towards the prohibition. Following the country's independence from the British Empire, the government encouraged vineyards to convert to table grape and raisin production. In the 1980s and 1990s, a revival in the Indian wine industry took place as international influences and the growing middle class started increasing demand for the beverage. By the turn of the 21st century, demand was increasing at a rate of 20-30% a year. The city of Nashik in the state of Maharashtra is called the ""Wine Capital of India."""
"Peruvian wine dates back to the Spanish colonization of the region in the 16th century. Peru shares a similar climate with wine-producing country Chile, which is favorable for producing wine. In 2008, there were some 14,000 hectares (35,000 acres) of grape plantations in Peru, including table grapes, and some 610,000 hectolitres (13,000,000 imp gal; 16,000,000 US gal) of wine was produced, with an increasing trend in both plantations and wine production. Most vineyards are located on the central coast, around Pisco and Ica, where most of Peru's winemaking and distillation takes place. Grape varieties cultivated include Albillo, Alicante Bouschet, Barbera, Cabernet Sauvignon, Grenache, Malbec, Moscatel, Sauvignon blanc and ."
"Argentina is the fifth largest producer of wine in the world. Argentine wine, as with some aspects of Argentine cuisine, has its roots in Spain. During the Spanish colonization of the Americas, vine cuttings were brought to Santiago del Estero in 1557, and the cultivation of the grape and wine production stretched first to neighboring regions, and then to other parts of the country. Historically, Argentine winemakers were traditionally more interested in quantity than quality with the country consuming 90% of the wine it produces (45 liters per year or 12 U.S. gallons per year per capita according to 2006 figures). Until the early 1990s, Argentina produced more wine than any other country outside Europe, though the majority of it was considered unexportable. However, the desire to increase exports fueled significant advances in quality. Argentine wines started being exported during the 1990s, and are currently growing in popularity, making it now the largest wine exporter in South America. The devaluation of the Argentine peso in 2002 further fueled the industry as production costs decreased and tourism significantly increased, giving way to a whole new concept of enotourism in Argentina. The most important wine regions of the country are located in the provinces of Mendoza, San Juan and La Rioja. Salta, Catamarca, Río Negro and more recently southern Buenos Aires are also wine producing regions. The Mendoza province produces more than 60% of the Argentine wine and is the source of an even higher percentage of the total exports. Due to the high altitude and low humidity of the main wine producing regions, Argentine vineyards rarely face the problems of insects, fungi, molds and other grape diseases that affect vineyards in other countries. This allows cultivating with little or no pesticides, enabling even organic wines to be easily produced. There are many different varieties of grapes cultivated in Argentina, reflecting the country's many immigrant groups. The French brought Malbec, which makes most of Argentina's best known wines. The Italians brought vines that they called Bonarda, although Argentine Bonarda appears to be the Douce noir of Savoie, also known as Charbono in California. It has nothing in common with the light fruity wines made from Bonarda Piemontese in Piedmont. Torrontés is another typically Argentine grape and is mostly found in the provinces of La Rioja, San Juan, and Salta. It is a member of the Malvasia group that makes aromatic white wines. It has recently been grown in Spain. Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Chardonnay and other international varieties are becoming more widely planted, but some varieties are cultivated characteristically in certain areas. In November 2010, the Argentine government declared wine as Argentina's national liquor."

The company has 100 employees and is headquartered in the southern Slovak village of Topolcianky, which has a wine-making tradition dating back to the 17th century. At the company premises, up to 5.600 hl of red wines are held in traditional oak barrels. In the modern part of the company´s cellar, a hundred stainless steel tanks hold up to 1.100 hl of white and rose wines each. The wines produced include typical varieties in the Danube region in categories of quality wines and wines with attribute. The typical grapes in the region include Grüner Veltliner, Welschriesling, Pinot blanc, Blaufränkisch, Pinot noir and some regional specialties such as Pálava, Děvín and Alibernet."
"Lancers is a brand of medium-sweet, lightly sparkling wine produced by the J. M. da Fonseca winery in Portugal. The brand was created in 1944, when Vintage Wines of New York predicted that wine consumption in the United States would increase after World War II. A sparkling Lancers, made by the continuous method, was introduced in the late 1980s. It was originally sold in distinctive squat bottles made of rust-colored, opaque crockery rather than clear glass."

Together the families represent seventeen wine-growing regions across Australia and forty-eight generations of winemakers. It was officially launched at the Sydney Opera House on 31 August 2009 by former Hon Tony Burke MP, Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry."
"The Douro Wine Company (also known as the General Company of Agriculture of the Wines of the Upper Douro and in Portuguese Companhia Geral da Agricultura e Vinhos do Alto Douro) was a government oversight organization established by the Portuguese Prime Minister Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of Pombal to regulate the trade and production of Port wine. Established in 1756, one of the first official duties of the company was the delineation of the boundaries of the Douro wine region. This act essentially made the Douro the world's first regional appellation. While the boundaries of the Chianti and Tokaji wine regions were outlined in 1716 and 1737, respectively, neither of these regions were ""technically"" appellations in the sense of being subjected to continued government control and regulations. Under their charter, Pombal invested an immense amount of control in the Douro Wine Company to regulate all exports of Port, set production quantities limits, fix maximum and minimum prices for grapes and to serve as sole arbitrator in any disputes between vine growers and Port shippers. In 1761, the company was further granted a monopoly on the sale of brandy which was used in the fortification process of Port winemaking. The Douro Wine Company continued to operate to 1833 (and was briefly revived from 1843 and 1853). Today, many of it functions have been deregulated with the Instituto dos Vinhos do Douro e do Porto or (Port and Douro Wines Institute) being the official regulating body of Port wine and Douro table wine production."
"Sidi Brahim is a range of branded wines produced in the Atlas mountains, first in Algeria, then in Morocco and now in Tunisia. The wines are blended and bottled or filled into bag-in-boxes in France, and are primarily sold there. It was the second-best selling foreign wine in France, behind Boulaouane (also a Castel brand), as of 2005. The production volume is around three million bottles annually. The wine has been named after the Battle of Sidi-Brahim (1845). The brand is currently owned by Groupe Castel, which acquired it (and Malesan) in 2003 from , a company founded by Bernard Magrez. Magrez/Pitters in turn bought it in 1982. The label of the red wine bottle states that it is ""harvested by hand since 1924"". The grape composition of Sidi Brahim and the range of wines offered has varied throughout the years, but in 2010 the composition is indicated as the following: 
* Red wine: Cabernet Sauvignon (50%), Syrah (30%), and Merlot (20%). 
* Rosé wine: Cinsault (40%) and Grenache gris (60%). 
* White wine: Chardonnay (100%). The blend of the red wine has previously included traditional grown varieties of North Africa (which it used to share with Languedoc-Roussillon), such as Alicante, Aramon, Carignan, Cinsault, and Grenache. The current composition is more ""New World-like""."

"Massandra or Masandra (Crimean Tatar: Massandra; Russian: Массандра; Ukrainian: Масандра) is an urban-type settlement in the Yalta Municipality in Crimea. Occupying the spot of an ancient Greek settlement (Tavrida-Ταυρίδα), Masandra was acquired by Counts Potocki in 1783. In the mid-19th century, it passed to Prince Vorontsov Jr, whose father was the governor of New Russia. Enraptured by a picturesque setting, Vorontsov in 1881 engaged a team of French architects to design for him a château in the Louis XIII style. He died the following year and construction work was suspended until 1889, when the messuage was purchased by Alexander III of Russia. The tsar asked architect Maximilian Messmacher to finish the palace for his own use but he did not live to see it completed in 1900. During the Soviet years, the palace was employed by Joseph Stalin as his dacha. Today, Masandra is known for its viniculture and production of dessert and fortified wines. The Massandra Winery was founded by Prince Lev Golitsyn in 1894. The enoteca of the winery contains about one million bottles of wine. A minor planet, 3298 Massandra, discovered in 1979 by N. Chernykh at Nauchnyj, is named after the settlement.

"Vienna (/viˈɛnə/; German: Wien [viːn]; Austro-Bavarian: Wean [veɐ̯n]) is the national capital, largest city, and one of nine states of Austria. Vienna is Austria's most populous city, with about 2 million inhabitants (2.6 million within the metropolitan area, nearly one third of the country's population), and its cultural, economic, and political centre. It is the 6th-largest city by population within city limits in the European Union. Until the beginning of the 20th century, Vienna was the largest German-speaking city in the world, and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I, the city had 2 million inhabitants. Today, it is the second-largest German-speaking city after Berlin. Vienna is host to many major international organizations, including the United Nations, OPEC and the OSCE. The city is located in the eastern part of Austria and is close to the borders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. These regions work together in a European Centrope border region. Along with nearby Bratislava, Vienna forms a metropolitan region with 3 million inhabitants. In 2001, the city center was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In July 2017 it was moved to the list of World Heritage in Danger. Additionally, Vienna is known as the ""City of Music"" due to its musical legacy, as many famous classical musicians such as Beethoven and Mozart called Vienna home. Vienna is also said to be the ""City of Dreams"", because of it being home to the world's first psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. Vienna's ancestral roots lie in early Celtic and Roman settlements that transformed into a Medieval and Baroque city.

"Lagaria (Greek: Λαγαρία), was an ancient town of Lucania, situated between Thurii and the river Siris (modern Sinni). According to legend, it was founded by a colony of Phocians under the command of Epeius, the architect of the Trojan Horse.

The statement of Strabo, above quoted, is the only clue to its position, which cannot therefore be determined with any certainty. Cluverius placed it at Nocara, about 16 km from the sea, and this conjecture (for it is nothing more) has been adopted by Romanelli.

"Sanlúcar de Barrameda (Spanish pronunciation: [sanˈlukaɾ ðe βaraˈmeða]), or simply Sanlúcar, is a city in the northwest of Cádiz province, part of the autonomous community of Andalucía in southern Spain. Sanlúcar is located on the left bank at the mouth of the Guadalquivir River opposite the Doñana National Park, 52 km from the provincial capital Cádiz and 119 km from Sevilla capital of the autonomous region Andalucía. Its population is 68,656 inhabitants (National Institute of Statistics 2019). Sanlúcar has been inhabited since ancient times, and is assumed to have belonged to the realm of the Tartessian civilization. The town of San Lucar was granted to the Spanish nobleman Alonso Pérez de Guzmán in 1297. Its strategic location made the city a starting point for the exploration, colonization and evangelization of America between the 15th and 17th centuries. Sanlúcar lost much of its strategic value after 1645 because of the disgrace of the House of Medina Sidonia, the general decline of Spain under Charles II, the relocation of the Casa de Contratación to the town of Cadiz in 1717, and the Lisbon earthquake of 1755. In the 19th century the economy of the city was converted to viticulture and summer tourism. The 20th century brought destruction and political upheaval as it did elsewhere in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. Sanlúcar was declared a Cultural Historical-artistic site in 1973. Since the restoration of democracy (1975–1982) its town council has borrowed heavily, making Sanlúcar the city with the lowest per capita income in Spain. Currently (2010) Sanlúcar is a summer tourist destination famous for its cuisine, especially manzanilla (a variety of fino sherry) and prawns. It is internationally renowned for beach horse racing and flamenco music. Less well known but equally important are the historical archives of the House of Medina Sidonia (Archivo de la Casa de Medina Sidonia); the major part of the patrimony of the House of Medina Sidonia is located in the palace of the same name. The patron saint of the city is Our Lady of Charity, to whom it was dedicated in 1917."

"Geelong (/dʒɪˈlɒŋ/) (Wathawurrung: Djilang/Djalang) is a port city located on Corio Bay and the Barwon River, in the state of Victoria, Australia. The traditional owners of the land on which Geelong sits are the Wadawurrung (also known as Wathaurong) people of the Kulin nation. Geelong is south-west of Melbourne, the state capital. It is the second largest Victorian city, with an estimated urban population of 268,277 as of June 2018. It is also Australia's second fastest growing city. Geelong runs from the plains of Lara in the north to the rolling hills of Waurn Ponds to the south, with Corio Bay to the east and the Barrabool Hills to the west. Geelong is the administrative centre for the City of Greater Geelong municipality, which covers urban, rural and coastal areas surrounding the city, including the Bellarine Peninsula. Geelong was named in 1827, with the name derived from the local Wathaurong Aboriginal name for the region, Djillong, thought to mean ""land"" or ""cliffs"" or ""tongue of land or peninsula"". Geelong City is also known as the 'Gateway City' due to its central location to surrounding Victorian regional centres like Ballarat in the north west, Torquay, Great Ocean Road and Warrnambool in the southwest, Hamilton, Colac and Winchelsea to the west, and the state capital of Melbourne in the north east. The area was first surveyed in 1838, three weeks after Melbourne. The post office was open by June 1840 (the second to open in the Port Phillip District).The first woolstore was erected in this period and it became the port for the wool industry of the Western District. During the gold rush, Geelong experienced a brief boom as the main port to the rich goldfields of the Ballarat district. The city then diversified into manufacturing, and during the 1860s, it became one of the largest manufacturing centres in Australia with its wool mills, ropeworks, and paper mills. It was proclaimed a city in 1910, with industrial growth from this time until the 1960s establishing the city as a manufacturing centre for the state, and the population grew to over 100,000 by the mid-1960s. During the city's early years, an inhabitant of Geelong was often known as a Geelongite, or a Pivotonian, derived from the city's nickname of ""The Pivot"", referencing the city's role as a shipping and rail hub for the area. Population increases over the last decade were due to growth in service industries, as the manufacturing sector has declined. Redevelopment of the inner city has occurred since the 1990s, as well as gentrification of inner suburbs, and currently has a population growth rate higher than the national average. Today, Geelong stands as an emerging health, education and advanced manufacturing hub. The city's economy is shifting quickly and despite experiencing the drawbacks of losing much of its heavy manufacturing, it is seeing much growth in other sectors, positioning itself as one of the leading non-capital Australian cities. It is home to the Geelong Football Club, the second oldest club in the Australian Football League."

A ruined medieval castle sits above the village and dominates the landscape to the south. It was built in the 14th century for Pope John XXII, the second of the popes to reside in Avignon. None of the subsequent Avignon popes stayed in Châteauneuf but after the schism of 1378 the antipope Clement VII sought the security of the castle. With the departure of the popes the castle passed to the archbishop of Avignon, but it was too large and too expensive to maintain and was used as a source of stone for building work in the village. At the time of the Revolution the buildings were sold off and only the donjon was preserved. During the Second World War an attempt was made to demolish the donjon with dynamite by German soldiers but only the northern half was destroyed; the southern half remained intact. Almost all the cultivable land is planted with grapevines.

"Sardinia (/sɑːrˈdɪniə/ sar-DIN-ee-ə; Italian: Sardegna [sarˈdeɲɲa]; Sardinian: Sardigna [saɾˈdiɲːa] and Sardínnia [saɾˈdinːja], also Saldigna, Sardíngia, Sardinna, Sardinza; Sassarese: Sardhigna; Gallurese: Saldigna; Algherese: Sardenya; Tabarchino: Sardegna) is the second-largest island in the Mediterranean Sea, after Sicily, and one of the 20 regions of Italy. It is located west of the Italian Peninsula, north of Tunisia and immediately south of the French island of Corsica. It is one of the five Italian regions that have been granted by special statute. Its official name is Regione Autonoma della Sardegna (Sardinian: Regione Autònoma de Sardigna; English: ""Autonomous Region of Sardinia""). It is divided into four provinces and a metropolitan city. The capital of the region of Sardinia — and its largest city — is Cagliari. Sardinia's indigenous language and the other minority languages spoken on the island (Sassarese, Gallurese, Algherese Catalan and Ligurian Tabarchino) are officially recognized by the regional law as having ""equal dignity"" with Italian. Sardinia has been inhabited since the Paleolithic. The island's most notable civilization is the indigenous Nuragic, which flourished from the 18th century BC to either 238 BC or the 2nd century AD in some parts of the island, and to the 6th century AD in that part of the island known as Barbagia. After a period in which the island was ruled by a political and economic alliance between the Nuragic Sardinians and the Phoenicians, parts of it were conquered by Carthage in the late 6th century BC, and by Rome in 238 BC. The Roman occupation lasted for 700 years. Beginning in the Early Middle Ages, the island was ruled by the Vandals and the Byzantines. In practice, the island was disconnected from Byzantium's territorial influence, which allowed the Sardinians to provide themselves with a self-ruling political organization, the four kingdoms known as Judicates. The Italian maritime republics of Pisa and Genoa struggled to impose political control over these indigenous kingdoms, but it was the Iberian Crown of Aragon which, in 1324, succeeded in bringing the island under its control, consolidating it into the Kingdom of Sardinia. This Iberian kingdom endured until 1718, when it was ceded to the Alpine House of Savoy; the Savoyards would politically merge their insular possession with their domains on the Italian Mainland which, during the period of Italian unification, they would go on to expand to include the whole Italian peninsula; their territory was so renamed into the Kingdom of Italy in 1861, and it was reconstituted as the present-day Italian Republic in 1946. Due to the variety of Sardinia's ecosystems, which include mountains, woods, plains, stretches of largely uninhabited territory, streams, rocky coasts, and long sandy beaches, Sardinia has been metaphorically described as a micro-continent. In the modern era, many travelers and writers have extolled the beauty of its long-untouched landscapes, which retain vestiges of the Nuragic civilization."
"Alsace-Lorraine is a historical region, now called Alsace-Moselle, located in France. It was created in 1871 by the German Empire after seizing the region from the Second French Empire in the Franco-Prussian War and Treaty of Frankfurt. Alsace-Lorraine was reverted to French ownership in 1918 as part of the Treaty of Versailles and Germany's defeat in World War I. When created in 1871, the region was named the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine (German: Reichsland Elsaß-Lothringen or Elsass-Lothringen; Alsatian: 's Rìchslànd Elsàss-Lothrìnga; Moselle Franconian/Luxembourgish: D'Räichland Elsass-Loutrengen) and as a new territory of the German Empire. The Empire annexed most of Alsace and the Moselle department of Lorraine, following its victory in the Franco-Prussian War. The Alsatian part lay in the Rhine Valley on the west bank of the Rhine River, east of the Vosges Mountains; the section originally in Lorraine was in the upper Moselle valley to the north of the Vosges. The territory encompassed almost all of Alsace (93%) and over a quarter of Lorraine (26%), while the rest of these regions remained parts of France. For historical reasons, specific legal dispositions are still applied in the territory in the form of a ""local law in Alsace-Moselle"". In relation to its special legal status, since reversion to France, the territory has been referred to administratively as Alsace-Moselle (Alsatian: 's Elsàss-Mosel). Since 2016, the historical territory has been part of the French administrative region of Grand Est."
"Sicily (Italian: Sicilia [siˈtʃiːlja]; Sicilian: Sicilia [sɪˈʃiːlja]) is the largest island in the Mediterranean Sea and one of the 20 regions of Italy. It is one of the five Italian autonomous regions and is officially referred to as Regione Siciliana. The region has 5 million inhabitants. Its capital city is Palermo. Sicily is in the central Mediterranean Sea, south of the Italian Peninsula, from which it is separated by the narrow Strait of Messina. Its most prominent landmark is Mount Etna, one of the tallest active volcanoes in Europe, and one of the most active in the world, currently 3,329 m (10,922 ft) high. The island has a typical Mediterranean climate. The earliest archaeological evidence of human activity on the island dates from as early as 12,000 BC. By around 750 BC, Sicily had three Phoenician and a dozen Greek colonies and it was later the site of the Sicilian Wars and the Punic Wars. After the end of the Roman province of Sicilia with the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD, Sicily was ruled during the Early Middle Ages by the Vandals, the Ostrogoths, the Byzantine Empire, and the Emirate of Sicily. The Norman conquest of southern Italy led to the creation of the County of Sicily in 1071, that was succeeded by Kingdom of Sicily, a state that existed from 1130 until 1816. Later, it was unified under the House of Bourbon with the Kingdom of Naples as the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. The island became part of Italy in 1860 following the Expedition of the Thousand, a revolt led by Giuseppe Garibaldi during the Italian unification, and a plebiscite. Sicily was given special status as an autonomous region on 15 May 1946, 18 days before the Italian institutional referendum of 1946. Sicily has a rich and unique culture, especially with regard to the , music, , cuisine, and architecture. It is also home to important archaeological and ancient sites, such as the Necropolis of Pantalica, the Valley of the Temples, Erice and Selinunte. Byzantine, Arab, Roman and Norman rule over Sicily has led to a blend of cultural influences."
"Alsace (/ælˈsæs/, also US: /ælˈseɪs, ˈælsæs/; Low Alemannic German/Alsatian: Elsàss [ˈɛlsɑs]; German: Elsass [ˈɛlzas]; Latin: Alsatia; French: [alzas]) is a cultural region and a territorial collectivity in Eastern France, on the west bank of the upper Rhine next to Germany and Switzerland. In 2017, it had a population of 1,889,589. Alsatian culture is characterized by a blend of Germanic and French influences. Until 1871, Alsace included the area now known as the Territoire de Belfort, which formed its southernmost part. From 1982 to 2016, Alsace was the smallest administrative région in metropolitan France, consisting of the Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin departments. Territorial reform passed by the French Parliament in 2014 resulted in the merger of the Alsace administrative region with Champagne-Ardenne and Lorraine to form Grand Est. On 1 January 2021, the departments of Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin merged into the new European Collectivity of Alsace but remained part of the region Grand Est. Alsatian is an Alemannic dialect closely related to Swabian and Swiss German, although since World War II most Alsatians primarily speak French. Internal and international migration since 1945 has also changed the ethnolinguistic composition of Alsace. For more than 300 years, from the Thirty Years' War to World War II, the political status of Alsace was heavily contested between France and various German states in wars and diplomatic conferences. The economic and cultural capital of Alsace, as well as its largest city, is Strasbourg, which sits right on the contemporary German international border.

"Pelee Island, Ontario, Canada /ˈpiliː/, is an island in the western half of Lake Erie. Pelee Island is connected to the Canadian and United States mainland by ferry service. At 42 km2 (16 sq mi), Pelee Island is the largest island in Lake Erie and the southernmost populated point in Canada. An Ontario Historical Plaque was erected by the province to commemorate the development of Pelee Island's role in Ontario's heritage. Nearby Middle Island is the southernmost point of land in Canada. Due to its southerly location and the moderating effect of Lake Erie, it has a slightly milder climate than inland areas. Its climate is one of the mildest in Canada, and the island has been used for vineyards and wine making since 1860, though local wine making died out in the early twentieth century and was restarted in the 1980s by the Pelee Island Winery. The island is an agricultural-based community, which grows about 2,000 hectares (5,000 acres) of soybeans, about 400 hectares (1,000 acres) of wheat, 200 hectares (500 acres) of grapes, and a few hectares of specialty corn. Pelee Island is part of an important flyway for migrating birds between Ohio, the Lake Erie islands and Point Pelee. Pelee Island has, for many years, hosted a fall pheasant hunt which attracts hunters from Canada, the United States and many other countries. The pheasant hunt brings tourist dollars to Pelee at a time of year when virtually no other activities are available, thus generating important revenue in the offseason."

"Beaujolais (/ˌboʊʒəˈleɪ/ BOH-zhə-LAY, French: [boʒɔlɛ]) is a French Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) wine generally made of the Gamay grape, which has a thin skin and is low in tannins. Like most AOC wines they are not labeled varietally. Whites from the region, which make up only 1% of its production, are made mostly with Chardonnay grapes though Aligoté is also permitted until 2024 (on condition the vines were planted before 2004). Beaujolais tends to be a very light-bodied red wine, with relatively high amounts of acidity. In some vintages, Beaujolais produces more wine than the Burgundy wine regions of Chablis, Côte d'Or, Côte Chalonnaise and Mâconnais put together. The wine takes its name from the historical Province of Beaujolais, a wine-producing region. It is located north of Lyon, and covers parts of the north of the department of Rhône, the Rhône-Alpes region and southern areas of the department of Saône-et-Loire, in Burgundy. While administratively considered part of the Burgundy wine region, the climate is closer to that of the Rhône, and the wine is sufficiently individual in character to be considered apart from Burgundy and Rhône. The region is known internationally for its long tradition of winemaking, for the use of carbonic maceration, and more recently for the popular Beaujolais nouveau."

Some plantations of Gamay and Pinot noir are made into red and rosé Mâcon, making up no more than 30% of the total wine production. Gamay is grown in the Beaujolais cru of Moulin-à-Vent, which extends into the Mâconnais, but has little in common with the wines north of the border."

"Campania (/kæmˈpeɪniə/, also UK: /kæmˈpæniə/, US: /kɑːmˈpɑːniə/, Italian: [kamˈpaːnja], Neapolitan: [kamˈbɑːnjə]) is an administrative region of Italy; most of it is in the south-western portion of the Italian peninsula (with the Tyrrhenian Sea to its west), but it also includes the small Phlegraean Islands and the island of Capri. As of 2018, the region had a population of around 5,820,000 people, making it Italy's third most populous region, and, with an area of 13,590 km2 (5,247 sq mi), its most densely populated region. Based on its GDP, Campania is also the most economically productive region in southern Italy and the 7th most productive in the whole country. Naples' urban area, which is in Campania, is the seventh most populous in the European Union. The region is home to 10 of the 58 UNESCO sites in Italy, including Pompeii and Herculaneum, the Royal Palace of Caserta, the Amalfi Coast and the Historic Centre of Naples. In addition, Campania's Mount Vesuvius is part of the UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves. Coastal areas in the region were colonised by the ancient Greeks between the 8th and 7th centuries BC, making those areas part of the so-called Magna Graecia. At that time, Capua was Campania’s leading city, while Naples was an anomaly, being predominantly Greek-speaking. Campania is rich in culture, especially with regard to food, music, architecture, and archaeological and ancient sites—such as Pompeii, Herculaneum, Oplontis, Paestum, Aeclanum, Stabiae, and Velia. The name ""Campania"" is derived from Latin; the Romans knew the region as Campania felix (""fertile countryside"" or ""happy countryside""). The rich natural beauty of Campania makes it important to the tourism industry: the city of Naples, the Amalfi Coast, Mount Vesuvius, and the islands of Capri and Ischia have long been major attractions."

"The Mendocino Ridge AVA is a coastal, cool climate and high altitude American Viticultural Area located entirely within the coastal zone of Mendocino County, California. The boundaries of the AVA encompass the coastal ridges adjacent to the Pacific Ocean that reach inland toward the Anderson Valley. Roughly 36 miles of the southernmost portion of the Mendocino Coast make up the western boundary of the AVA, with the Sonoma County line as the southern boundary, the Navarro River as the northern boundary and Anderson Valley as the inland boundary running northwest–southeast. The Mendocino Ridge AVA ""is essentially a northern extension of the true Sonoma Coast viticultural area."" However, the Mendocino Ridge AVA designation is unique in that it is limited by elevation, reserved only for vineyards at or above 1200 feet. This is why the Mendocino Ridge AVA has been nicknamed ""Islands in the Sky®,"" because the vineyards sitting at 1200 feet or higher are often perched above thick fog moving inland from the Pacific Ocean blanketing the coast and the valleys between the ridge tops, making the tips of the mountains look like islands protruding from a sea of fog. In this overlapping, ""[t]he Mendocino Ridge AVA floats above the Anderson Valley and Mendocino appellations."" Mendocino Ridge is the only non-contiguous AVA in the United States; all others are contiguous landmasses with all vineyards inside the boundaries designated as part of the AVA, whereas Mendocino Ridge in comparison only includes the higher altitude growing sites. ""There are 262,400 acres (410 square miles, 36 miles long from north to south) within the outer boundaries of the Mendocino Ridge viticultural area, but the actual viticultural area encompasses only 87,466 acres which lie above 1,200 feet elevation. Of these 87,466 acres, approximately 1,500 to 2,000 acres (2% of the total acreage) of the ridge tops are suitable for vineyards. The side-slopes are very steep (often above 70%) and covered with timber, making them unfit for planting"". Estimates of planted acres range from 233 to 410, which accounts for about 0.3% of the total area. These planted acres are scattered among 16 remote vineyards. The 18 vineyards in the Mendocino Ridge AVA are: Fashauer Vineyards, Arietta-Dupratt Vineyard, Ciapusci Vineyard, Copper Queen, Drew Winery – Field Station Ranch, Ferrari-Carano Vineyards – Sky High Ranch, Gianoli Ranch Vineyards, Greenwood Ridge Vineyards, Highlands Vineyard, Mariah Vineyards and Winery, Perli Vineyards, Philo Crest Vineyards, Manchester Ridge Vineyard, Baker Ranch Vineyard, Signal Ridge Vineyard, Valenti Vineyard, Wentworth Vineyard, and Zeni Vineyard. The wineries located inside the Mendocino Ridge AVA are: Baxter Winery, Drew Family Cellars, Greenwood Ridge Winery, Mariah Vineyards and Winery, and Phillips Hill Winery. The average high temperature is 75.9 °F and the average low temperature is 49.4 °F. In the Mendocino Ridge AVA ""[t]he diurnal variation during the growing season is significantly less than the Anderson Valley (20 degrees versus 40-50 degrees in Anderson Valley), and daytime high temperatures are often 10 degrees cooler than in the Anderson Valley."" The soil composition is of the ""timber"" type, shallow and with good drainage due to the ridge top locations. Average annual rainfall average is 58 inches, leaving sufficient groundwater to dry farm vineyards. While Mendocino Ridge was only approved as an AVA in 1997, it has some of the oldest vineyards in the region. Italian immigrants in the late 1800s planted on Greenwood Ridge and surrounding areas, preferring zinfandel which remains a popular varietal in the AVA, although pinot noir has become the most common grape in the region since the 1990s. Other plantings (ordered by decreasing representation in total acres) include Chardonnay, Syrah, Merlot, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Primitivo, Petite Sirah, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Grüner Veltliner. Much of the non-planted land is covered by Redwood and Douglas Fir trees."

"The El Dorado AVA is an American Viticultural Area located in El Dorado County, California, United States. Wine grape growers in the region produce a large diversity of varietals, notable varietals are Zinfandel, Barbera, and Syrah and there are significant plantings of Rhône varietals. Located in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains, vineyards are found at elevations between 1,200 feet (366 m) and 3,500 feet (1,067 m) above sea level and some of the best vineyards are planted above 2,000 feet (610 m) elevation. The region benefits from the cool breezes that come off the mountains and push hot air off the vines and down to the valley. The soils of the region are magma based with high levels of acidity. Established in 1983, The El Dorado American Viticultural Area (AVA, also referred to as an ""appellation"") includes those portions of El Dorado County bounded on the north by the Middle Fork of the American River, and on the south by the South Fork of the Cosumnes River. El Dorado is a sub-appellation of the 2,600,000-acre Sierra Foothills AVA — one of the largest appellations in California — which includes portions of the counties of Yuba, Nevada, Placer, El Dorado, Amador, Calaveras, Tuolumne and Mariposa. The El Dorado appellation is unique due to its high elevation and complex topography. El Dorado's mountain vineyards are perched at elevations high above the large, center state valleys, near sea level. The topography is impacted by cooling breezes off the High Sierra Nevada and the complex mountainous topography creates a diversity of micro-climates and growing conditions not found in other regions in the big central valley or coastal mountain settings. Coastal mountains may have vineyard elevations of 200-1,500 feet above sea level (up to 500 meters), where El Dorado wineries tend to start at 1,200 and elevate to 3,500 feet above sea level (1,000 meters) or even higher in some vineyards. These micro climates provide ideal locations for growing a wide variety of grapes identified with the world's finest wine regions, including Bordeaux, the Rhône, Germany, Italy and Spain. El Dorado grows approximately 70 or more different varieties of grapes, ranging from Gewürztraminer, which does best in the higher and cooler portions of the county, to Zinfandel and Barbera, which ripen perfectly in warmer climates. A significant culture of Rhone varietals are cultivated in the El Dorado AVA for many decades already including significant plantings of Viognier, Syrah, Mourvedre and Grenache grapes. El Dorado is cooled by elevation rather than by the fog that is common to the coastal regions. This means the grapes receive more direct sunlight, thus ripening fully without retaining excess herbaceous characters or acidity that is out of balance with the fruit flavors. El Dorado's relatively cool fall temperatures also allow the grapes a long ""hang time"" for uniform ripening. In conjunction with the climate, there are three basic soil types determining the characteristics of the region: fine-grained volcanic rock, decomposed granite and fine-grained shale. Varying in elevation and topography, each soil offers good drainage and the nutrients needed to encourage vines producing rich, deeply flavored grapes. The unique combination of climate, soil and topography found in the El Dorado appellation produce wines of distinction, depth and density with a maturity unmatched in other regions. This is El Dorado's ""terroir."""

"The Yountville AVA is an American Viticultural Area located within Napa Valley AVA and centered on the town Yountville, California. The town's founder George Calvert Yount planted the first vineyard in this area around 1836. Yountville AVA is one of the coolest wine regions in Napa Valley, which helps contribute to a long growing season. The area is particularly known for its very tannic Cabernet Sauvignon varietal wines that have the capability of aging well in the bottle."
"The Diamond Mountain District AVA is an American Viticultural Area located in California's Mayacamas Mountains in the northwest portion of the Napa Valley AVA. The appellation sits at a higher elevation than most of Napa Valley's wine region, resulting in less cool fog coming in from San Pablo Bay, and more direct exposure to sunlight. The soil of this AVA is volcanic and very porous which allows it to cool down quickly despite the increased sunlight."
"The Oak Knoll District of Napa Valley AVA is an American Viticultural Area located within Napa Valley AVA at the southern end of the valley floor. The appellation's close proximity to San Pablo Bay results in a climate that is cooler and more moderate than any region in Napa Valley other than the Los Carneros AVA. The AVA has more vines planted to it than any other wholly contained appellation within the Napa Valley. A wide variety of wine grapes do well in this climate, including varieties not widely grown in other parts of Napa Valley, such as Riesling and Pinot noir. The district is planted largely to Merlot, Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon, in that order. Oak Knoll District Chardonnay has a reputation for a restrained, delicate style. The appellation was officially designated an appellation within the Napa Valley AVA on April 26, 2004."
"The Chiles Valley AVA is an American Viticultural Area located within Napa Valley AVA, in Napa County, California. The Chiles Valley is nestled in the Vaca Mountains above the northeast side of the Napa Valley. The appellation has a cooler climate than the main Napa Valley floor due to elevations of 600–1200 feet as well as a cooling breeze from the Pacific Ocean. The most planted grapes in Chiles Valley are Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel, Chardonnay, and Sauvignon blanc."
"The Bennett Valley AVA is an American Viticultural Area located in Sonoma County, California. The boundaries of this appellation lie completely within the North Coast AVA, almost completely within the Sonoma Valley AVA and overlaps into some areas of the Sonoma Coast AVA and Sonoma Mountain AVA. The region was granted AVA status on December 23, 2003 following the petition of . The AVA is surrounded to the south, east and west by the Sonoma Mountains and to the north by the city of Santa Rosa, California. The region receives a moderating effect on its climate from Pacific Ocean through the cool coastal fogs and breeze that creep into the area from the southwest through between Sonoma Mountain and Taylor Mountain. Barbera, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Chardonnay, Grenache, Merlot, Pinot noir, Sauvignon blanc and Syrah are the leading grape varieties planted."
"The Northern Sonoma AVA is an American Viticultural Area in Sonoma County, California, United States. The appellation covers most of the county with the notable exceptions of the Los Carneros AVA and Sonoma Valley AVA wine regions, which are located in the southern portion of the county. The creation of this AVA was largely based on the petitioning of the E & J Gallo Winery as part of their expansion of their Gallo of Sonoma brand. The viticultural area incorporates the Alexander Valley AVA, Chalk Hill AVA, Dry Creek Valley AVA, Knights Valley AVA, Russian River Valley AVA, Sonoma Coast AVA, and parts of the Green Valley of Russian River Valley AVA and Rockpile AVA valleys. The majority of the grape varieties grown in Sonoma County are grown in Northern Sonoma AVA, including Cabernet Sauvignon, Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, and Zinfandel. Zinfandel is more commonly grown in the Rockpile and Dry Creek Valleys. Gallo Family Vineyards are known for their Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay while Rodney Strong Vineyards is known for its Zinfandel and Sauvignon Blanc. Bacigalupi Vineyards, situated in the Russian River Valley, are known for their Chardonnay."
The Howell Mountain AVA is an American Viticultural Area located within Napa Valley AVA of California.
"The Atlas Peak AVA is an American Viticultural Area located within Napa Valley AVA just northeast of the city of Napa. The appellation sits on a higher elevation than most of Napa's wine region which limits the effects of the cool fog coming in from Pacific Ocean. The westward orientation of most vineyards on the Vaca Mountains also extends the amount of direct sunlight on the grapes. The soil of this AVA is volcanic and very porous which allows it to cool down quickly despite the increased sunlight. The area has a fairly significant diurnal temperature variation upwards of 30 °F (17 °C) between daytime and night. This contributes to the balance of acidity that grapes from Atlas Peak vineyards are known to have. In August 2020, Atlas Peak was evacuated due to the Hennessey Fire, which resulted in the burning of over 315,000 acres (127,476 ha) in five counties, including in north Atlas Peak."
"Los Carneros AVA (also known as Carneros AVA) is an American Viticultural Area which includes parts of both Sonoma and Napa counties in California, U.S.A.. It is located north of San Pablo Bay. The proximity to the cool fog and breezes from the bay makes the climate in Los Carneros cooler and more moderate than the wine regions farther north in Napa Valley and Sonoma Valley. The cooler climate has made Los Carneros attractive for the cultivation of cooler climate varietals like Pinot noir and Chardonnay. Many of the grapes grown in Los Carneros are used for sparkling wine production. Receiving its AVA status in 1983, the Carneros area was the first wine region in California to be defined by its climate characteristics rather than political boundaries."
"The Stags Leap District AVA is an American Viticultural Area located within the Napa Valley AVA 6 miles (9.7 km) north of the city of Napa, California. The Stags Leap District was the first appellation to be designated an AVA based on the unique terroir characteristics of its soil. The soil of this region include loam and clay sediments from the Napa River and volcanic soil deposits left over from erosion of the Vaca Mountains. Like many Napa Valley AVAs, Stags Leap District is particularly known for its Cabernet Sauvignon. In 1976 at the Judgment of Paris wine tasting, the 1973 Stag's Leap Wine Cellars Cabernet from the area that would become this AVA won first place in the red wine category, beating out classified Bordeaux estates. Today, the Stags Leap District is home to twenty different wineries."
"The Wild Horse Valley AVA is an American Viticultural Area whose borders overlap both Napa County and Solano County, California and is partially contained within the Napa Valley AVA. The appellation's southerly location results in more hours of sunshine than other locations in Napa Valley or nearby Green Valley. The proximity to San Pablo Bay results in a cooler climate, making Wild Horse Valley attractive for the cultivation of grapes like Pinot noir."
"The St. Helena AVA (or Saint Helena AVA) is an American Viticultural Area located within Napa Valley, centered on the town of St. Helena, California. The appellation covers 9,000 acres (3,642 ha) along the flat narrow land towards the northern end of the valley between the Vaca and Mayacamas Mountains. Charles Krug, one of pioneers of Napa Valley winemaking, opened his winery here in 1861. The AVA hosts more than 80 wineries."
"The Spring Mountain District AVA is an American Viticultural Area located in the Napa Valley AVA in California. Spring Mountain District AVA was officially established as an American Viticulture Area in 1993. Encompassed within its bounds are about 8,600 acres (3,480 ha), of which about 1,000 acres (400 ha) are planted to vineyards. Given the small crop yields on hillsides, the region represents less than 2% of Napa Valley wine. Currently the region has just over 30 winegrowers. The appellation sits on steep terraces of the Mayacamas Mountains that separate Napa Valley from Sonoma Valley and the Santa Rosa Plain. It lies in a northwestern portion of the Napa Valley above and behind the town of Saint Helena. The boundaries of the appellation extend from the top of the ridgeline on the western edge, tracing the Sonoma/Napa County border. From the ridgeline the boundaries extend down to the 400 feet (122 m) contour line at the eastern base of the hillside. The southern boundary is Sulphur Creek and one of its tributaries, while the northern boundary is . Elevations range from 400 feet (122 m) to 2,600 feet (792 m). The region has a predominantly eastern exposure."
"The Rutherford AVA is an American Viticultural Area located within Napa Valley AVA and centered on the town of Rutherford, California. The area is known for its unique terroir particularly with its Cabernet Sauvignon. The well-drained soil of this area is composition of gravel, loam and sand with volcanic deposits and marine sediments from the Franciscan Assemblage.

"The Calistoga AVA is an American Viticultural Area located in the northern portion of California's Napa Valley AVA. The appellation is distinguished by its volcanic soil, high temperatures up to 100 °F (38 °C) during the day, and cool nights during the growing season due to breezes from the Russian River, causing the highest diurnal temperature variation in the Napa Valley—up to 50 °F (28 °C)."
"The Coombsville AVA is an American Viticultural Area located within the Napa Valley AVA just east of the city of Napa. The appellation varies from near sea level at the Napa River on the west to 1,900 feet at the ridge of the Vaca Mountain Range. Proximity to San Pablo Bay contributes to the temperate climate of Coombsville. Cooling effects of marine air and fog occur almost daily during the growing season, arriving earlier and lingering longer than in the more northern regions of Napa Valley. Temperatures are less extreme during the winter frost season. The Coombsville soils are dominated by the volcanic rhyolitic tuff sedimentary rock and lava flows of the Vaca Range on the eastern side of the Napa Valley. Located in the wide alluvial deposits created by the wearing down of the hillsides the Coombsville soils contain abundant rock, gravel and, in some areas, are layered with volcanic ash deposits from Mount George. The appellation was officially designated the 16th sub-appellation of the Napa Valley AVA on December 14, 2011."
"The Sonoma Coast AVA is an American Viticultural Area in Sonoma County, California, United States containing more than 500,000 acres (2,000 km2), mostly along the coastline of the Pacific Ocean.

"The Santa Clara Valley AVA is an American Viticultural Area located in Santa Clara Valley, California (modern day Silicon Valley), based in the towns of Morgan Hill, Saratoga, San Martin, and Gilroy. Apart from its participation in the production of California wines, the Santa Clara Valley AVA is noted for its popularity in wine tourism. The area served an important role in the early history of California wine and was home to the pioneer winemakers Paul Masson and Charles Lefranc. The AVA boundary was defined in 1989. The Santa Clara Valley AVA is home to two smaller AVAs, Pacheco Pass AVA and San Ysidro District AVA."
"The Solano County Green Valley AVA is an American Viticultural Area located in Solano County, California. Located southeast of the Napa Valley AVA, Green Valley is about 1 mile (1.6 km) wide and 4 miles (6.4 km) long. The valley is close to San Pablo Bay and thus has a maritime climate. Most of the vineyards are planted on the valley floor and benefit from moist, cooling winds in the summer afternoons."
"The Missouri Rhineland is a geographical area of Missouri that extends from west of St. Louis to slightly east of Jefferson City, located mostly in the Missouri River Valley on both sides of the river. Dutzow, the first permanent German settlement in Missouri, was founded in 1832 by Baron von Bock. The area is named after the Rhineland region in central Europe, a wine-growing area around the Rhine river, by German-Americans who noticed similarities in the two regions' soil and topography. The soils of the Missouri River Valley and surrounding areas are mainly rocky residual soils left after the carbonate (mainly limestone) bedrock weathered away to impurities of clayey soil and chert fragments. Farther to the north, glacial deposits and wind-deposited loess, a silty soil also associated with the glaciers, are intermingled with the residual soils. While the soil could support other crops, the steep slopes of these areas were better used for viticulture. German settlers established the first wineries in the mid-19th century. Italian immigrants later established their own vineyards, especially near Rolla in Phelps County. By 1920, Missouri was the second-largest wine-producing state in the nation. Then came Prohibition, which ruined the industry. In the 1960s, local winemakers began to rebuild, part of a movement in states across the country. In 1980, An area around Augusta, Missouri, was designated by the federal government as the first American Viticultural Area (AVA), and one around Hermann, Missouri, was designated an AVA in 1983. Much of the region of the Missouri Rhineland from Augusta to Jefferson City along the Missouri River is part of the larger Ozark Mountain AVA. Winning national tasting awards, the state's wine industry contributes to both the agricultural and tourist economies."
"The Willamette Valley AVA (/wɪˈlæmɪt/ wi-LAM-it), is an American Viticultural Area which lies in the Willamette Valley of Oregon. The AVA is the wine growing region which encompasses the drainage basin of the Willamette River. It stretches from the Columbia River in the north to just south of Eugene in the south, where the Willamette Valley ends; and from the Oregon Coast Range in the west to the Cascade Mountains in the east. At 5,360 square miles (13,900 km2), it is the largest AVA in the state, and contains most of the state's wineries; approximately 200 as of 2006. The boundaries of the Willamette Valley AVA were established in 1984, and since then seven new, smaller AVAs have been created within the northern portion of Willamette Valley AVA. The Willamette Valley has a cool, moist climate, and is recognized worldwide for its Pinot noir. Although this distinction is not officially recognized, many wine connoisseurs further divide the Willamette Valley into northern and southern regions, the dividing line being the approximate latitude of Salem (approximately 45° north latitude)."
"The Grand Valley AVA is an American Viticultural Area located in Mesa County, Colorado, primarily in Grand Junction and Palisade. It is located roughly 200 miles West-Southwest of Denver. The high-desert AVA - with an average elevation of between 4,000 and 5,000 feet above sea level - is defined by the irrigated agricultural area served via canals within the Grand Valley of the Colorado River. The AVA was established in 1991 as the first of two Colorado wine regions. The West Elks AVA is the second federally designated AVA in Colorado. The AVA encompasses 75,990 acres (30,750 ha) and contains some of the highest vineyards in the world. The terrain is varied, ranging from alluvial soils along the Colorado River to stony and loamy soils on mesas. Climate is high desert, subject to swings of temperature and wide diurnal variation. The AVA enjoys the most temperate climate within the state of Colorado, with the USDA cold hardiness zone ranging from 6 to 7. The eastern part of the AVA near the town of Palisade has consistent breezes that provide good air drainage, reducing the risk of frost. During a typical growing season, the valley is hot, dry and sunny during the day while far cooler at night due to the arid environment. This makes for ideal fruit-growing conditions. Colorado's Grand Valley - particularly the eastern stretch - is unofficially considered 'Colorado Wine Country' and is quickly becoming a popular and sought after destination for Enotourism because of both the growing interest in wine tourism and the abundance of natural recreational activities and scenery surrounding the area including Colorado National Monument and the Book Cliffs. There are around two dozen wineries/vineyards in addition to an abundance of cideries, meaderies, and orchards. Viticulture began in the area in the late 19th century. State Governor George A. Crawford planted a 60 acres (24 ha) vineyard in the Grand Valley in 1890. To this day, most of Colorado's grape production is from the Grand Valley AVA. Vineyards in the valley are planted at elevations as high as 4,700 feet (1,400 m) above sea level. However, the continental climate somewhat limits the varieties used in grape production and not all varieties produce substantial yields. Grape varieties planted within the AVA vary widely and average yields are relatively low at about 2.5 tons/acre. Wine styles range from dry white and red wines to semi-sweet and dessert wines; and even ice wine. Due to the abundance of orchards in the area many growers will incorporate other local fruits - such as peaches, plums and cherries - into their sweeter wines. However, traditional Merlot & Riesling are two of the most popular and easily grown and known grapes in Grand Valley. In 2018, Wine Enthusiast Magazine named Colorado's Grand Valley AVA one of the 'Top Ten Wine Travel Destinations in the World'. On September 2019, Palisade hosted its 28th annual Colorado Mountain Winefest which was named the 'Best Wine Fest in the Nation' by USA Today. Over 6,000 attended the sold-out event which showed off several hundred local wines, meads & ciders from several dozen Colorado wineries, meaderies and cideries."

The AVA contains one sub-region, the Cape May Peninsula AVA, which was established in 2018."
"The Long Island AVA is an American Viticultural Area encompassing Nassau and Suffolk counties of New York, including the smaller offshore islands in those counties. The AVA was established in 2001, over 15 years after two smaller AVAs were created at the eastern end of Long Island. The Long Island AVA designation was promoted as a benefit for some wineries located just outside the two smaller AVAs and for wineries that wanted to create wines that use blends from vineyards in different parts of the island. It was also developed and promoted as a consumer protection of the Long Island name; AVAs require that a minimum of 85% of the fruit used in the designated wine is grown within the borders of the region. The ""Long Island"" AVA was authored by veteran Long Island winemaker Richard Olsen-Harbich who also authored ""The Hamptons, Long Island"" and ""North Fork of Long Island"" AVAs in the mid-1980s. Vineyards on Long Island benefit from the moderating influence of the Atlantic Ocean, Long Island Sound, and Peconic Bay on the local climate. The region is located in hardiness zones 7a and 7b."
"The North Fork of Long Island AVA is an American Viticultural Area located in eastern Suffolk County, New York. Authored by winemaker Richard Olsen-Harbich in 1985, it includes the entire North Fork of Long Island and the townships of Riverhead, Shelter Island, and Southold. The North Fork of Long Island is home to over 40 wineries and 3,000 acres (1,200 ha) of planted vineyards. The local climate is heavily influenced by the presence of Long Island Sound, Peconic Bay, and the Atlantic Ocean. The maritime influences of these bodies of water help to moderate temperature fluctuations and extend the growing season up to a month longer than other regions in New York. The most planted grape varieties in the region are Merlot, Chardonnay, and Cabernet Franc. The hardiness zone is 7a."
"The Hudson River Region AVA is an American Viticultural Area around the Hudson River in eastern New York. The region is home to the oldest continuously operating winery in North America, the Brotherhood Winery, established in 1839. The oldest continuously cultivated vineyard in North America is also located in the Hudson River Region AVA, and is today operated by . Most vineyards in the region are located within 2 miles (3.2 km) of the river. The Hudson River flows from north to south, and most vineyards are planted on hills on the western side of the river, where early morning sunshine can rapidly warm the vines. Ocean breezes channeled north up the river help to moderate the climate in the region, making it cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter than surrounding areas. The hardiness zone ranges from 7a to 6a. The most important grape varieties in the area are French hybrids and cool-climate Vitis vinifera varieties."
"The Cayuga Lake AVA is an American Viticultural Area around Cayuga Lake in Upstate New York. The boundaries of the AVA include portions of Cayuga, Seneca, and Tompkins counties. Most of the vineyards in the AVA are planted in the shale soils of the hillsides on the western side of Cayuga Lake. Vineyards are planted at a range of elevations above the surface of the lake, up to 800 feet (244 m) higher. The steep hillsides and the lake together form a unique micro-climate in autumn that helps extend the growing season by preventing cold air from settling and producing frost. The Cayuga grape variety was created in this region by researchers at Cornell University."
"The Yadkin Valley AVA is an American Viticultural Area that includes land in seven counties of northwestern North Carolina. The AVA encompasses an area of approximately 1,400,000 acres (5,666 km2) in the Yadkin River valley.

"The Martha's Vineyard AVA is an American Viticultural Area located in Dukes County, Massachusetts, including all of the land on the islands named Martha's Vineyard and Chappaquiddick Island. These two islands are located off the southern Massachusetts coast, surrounded by Vineyard Sound, Nantucket Sound, and the Atlantic Ocean. The creation of the AVA in 1985 was controversial. Objections were lodged by the proprietors of a vineyard in California also named Martha's Vineyard, who felt that the creation of an AVA with the same name would dilute their brand value. Federal regulators ruled in favor of the AVA, citing historical evidence that viticulture has been practiced on the Massachusetts island named Martha's Vineyard since at least 1602. The maritime location helps to create a slightly warmer climate than the nearby coastal regions of Massachusetts, and a growing season that is almost three weeks longer. The hardiness zone is 7a."
"Lake Michigan Shore AVA is an American Viticultural Area located in southwest Michigan. Located in the state's traditional ""fruit belt region"", Lake Michigan Shore is the oldest modern commercial grape region of the state and home to a majority of Michigan vineyards and half of the state wine grape production.

"The Wisconsin Ledge AVA is an American Viticultural Area in northeast Wisconsin along the Niagara Escarpment (locally referred to as ""The Ledge"") in Door, Kewaunee, Manitowoc, Sheboygan, Ozaukee, Washington, Dodge, Fond du Lac, Calumet, Outagamie, and Brown counties. Certified by the United States Department of the Treasury's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau on March 22, 2012, it covers an area of 3,800 sq mi (9,800 km2) and is the second AVA designation wholly in Wisconsin, following the Lake Wisconsin AVA established in 1994. The state's third is the gargantuan Upper Mississippi River Valley AVA which also covers land in Minnesota, Iowa and Illinois.After 7 long years, and 4000 hours, Steven J. DeBaker of Trout Springs Winery was granted his petition to the TTB for establishment of the Wisconsin Ledge AVA. It became the 203rd AVA in the US, including just under 2.5 million acres making it the 12th largest AVA in the US. Today, there are 24 bonded wineries that lie within the AVA with over 400 acres of vines planted. The topography of Wisconsin Ledge is the result of ancient glacial movement over the region. The land on the peninsula slopes gently upward from the shores of Lake Michigan to the top of the Ledge, before dropping sharply off into Green Bay. Most of the vineyards lie on these eastern-facing slopes that benefit from constant air movement from Lake Michigan, which stores warmth during the summer. The presence of the lake produces a vacuum of sorts during the growing season: warm air over the lake rises, sucking colder air off the land and creating offshore breezes. Cold air cannot settle over the vineyards and there is a constant flow of warmer air, making the growing season here longer than in other parts of Wisconsin. Wisconsin Ledge's glacial soils are made up of gravel, sand and clay over limestone bedrock. An aquifer below the AVA provides mineral-rich ground water to the vines, encouraging deep root growth. The hardiness zone is almost entirely 5b."
"The Shenandoah Valley AVA is an American Viticultural Area located in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia and West Virginia. The valley is bounded by the Blue Ridge Mountains to the east and the Appalachian and Allegheny Plateaus to the west. Most of the AVA is in Virginia, with a small portion in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia. Most of the vineyards in the AVA are located in Virginia and grow a wide variety of Vitis vinifera, Vitis labrusca, and French hybrid grapes. The hardiness zone is mainly 6b except for some 7a closer to the mouth of the Shenandoah. The region is Virginia's first AVA, identified in 1982. Limestone soil, which is common to the Valley, has been long associated with great wine growing regions in Europe. The Shenandoah Valley AVA's climate allows grapes to attain higher acidity, generally regarded as good in wine. The cooler, relatively dry climate, soil composition and position between two mountain chains makes the Shenandoah Valley more ideal for viticulture than any of the state's other regions. The Shenandoah Valley is relatively dry, a ""rain shadow"" between the Blue Ridge and Allegheny Mountains; the annual rainfall in the Valley is one half that of the Virginia average. The growing season in the valley is distinctly warmer and drier than in neighboring Virginia regions, which don't have the natural rain barrier from the nearby mountains and where, east of the Blue Ridge, vineyard soils are primarily clay and loam. The conditions in the Shenandoah Valley AVA are thus more hospitable than those east of the mountains for Cabernet Franc, Chambourcin, Cabernet Sauvignon, Lemberger, Petit Manseng, Petit Verdot, Pinot Noir, and Riesling."

"Usakhelauri is a naturally semi-sweet Georgian wine. The Usakhelauri grape, from which Usakhelauri red wine is made, is grown on the mountain slopes of the Lechkhumi, in western Georgia, mainly near the villages of Okhureshi, Zubi and Isunderi. These grapes are scarce and a limited amount of land is available, producing only around three tons of grapes each year, making them highly prized. They are the premier wine grape of Georgia. The name ""Usakhelauri"" means ""nameless"" in Georgian, which translates in meaning to a cross between ""beyond words"", and ""priceless"". In a very good year, there are only about 1,000 bottles produced in the country, mainly by Teliani Valley, and some by Telavi Wine Cellars. Because of this, its cost is quite high at more than US$50 per bottle, direct from the winery. Usakhelauri contains 10.5–12.0% alcohol, 3–5% sugar and has 5–7% titrated acidity."
"Mukuzani (Georgian: მუკუზანი muk’uzani) is a dry red Georgian wine made from Saperavi grapes in Mukuzani, Kakheti.

"The Hunter Region, also commonly known as the Hunter Valley, is a region of New South Wales, Australia, extending from approximately 120 km (75 mi) to 310 km (193 mi) north of Sydney. It contains the Hunter River and its tributaries with highland areas to the north and south. Situated at the northern end of the Sydney Basin bioregion, the Hunter Valley is one of the largest river valleys on the NSW coast, and is most commonly known for its wineries and coal industry. Most of the population of the Hunter Region lives within 25 km (16 mi) of the coast, with 55% of the entire population living in the cities of Newcastle and Lake Macquarie. There are numerous other towns and villages scattered across the region in the eleven local government areas (LGAs) that make up the region. At the 2011 census the combined population of the region was 620,530. Under Australia's wine appellation system, the Hunter Valley wine zone Australian Geographical Indication (GI) covers the entire catchment of the Hunter River and its tributaries. Within that, the Hunter region is almost as large, and includes most of the wine-producing areas, excluding the metropolitan area of Newcastle and nearby coastal areas, some national parks, and any land that was in the (at the western heights of the catchment). The Hunter wine region is one of Australia's best known wine regions, playing a pivotal role in the history of Australian wine as one of the first wine regions planted in the early 19th century. The success of the Hunter Valley wine industry has been dominated by its proximity to Sydney with its settlement and plantings in the 19th century fuelled by the trade network that linked the valley to the city. The steady demand of consumers from Sydney continues to drive much of the Hunter Valley wine industry, including a factor in the economy by the tourism industry. While the Hunter Valley has been supplanted by the massive Riverina wine region as the largest producer of New South Wales wine, it still accounts for around 3% of Australia's total wine production and is one of the country's most recognisable regions."

The Glenmark station is based in Waipara. The Glenmark church has closed down. It was damaged during the 2010 Christchurch earthquakes. The Waipara Hotel burnt down in 2014. It was not insured at the time and has not been replaced. The Waipara region has a reputation as a premium area for the production of Pinot noir, Riesling and Chardonnay. Waipara is sheltered by the Teviot hills from the prevailing cool easterly winds and has the highest summer temperatures and the lowest rainfall of any of the New Zealand wine regions. Because of this, Waipara has over 26 wineries and 80 vineyards within the valley, which collectively produce around 100,000 cases of award-winning wine in an average year. Many of the vineyards offer tastings at their cellar doors and some also have restaurants attached. There are a number of day walks close in Waipara including Tiromoana Bush Walkway and the Mt Cass Walkway which is closed during lambing season. Waipara would have been once been covered in totara, lacebark, kowhai, lancewood and broadleaf forest. It is now predominantly vineyards. There have been a number of ongoing projects to increase the biodiversity of the area. Work is ongoing to plant native species in Waipara's shelter belts, stream boundaries, pond edges and vineyard borders. These have provided benefits in pollination, pest control and weed suppression. It has worked so well that the plantings have resulted in a drop in the use of pesticides in the vineyards. The Waipara Environmental Trapping Association (WETA) is aiming to trap rats and other introduced species with the aim of making Waipara a predator-free paradise for native birds."
"Epanomi (Greek: Επανομή) is a town and was a former municipality in the Thessaloniki regional unit, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality of Thermaikos, of which it is a municipal unit. It is located 25 km away from the city center of Thessaloniki. The municipal unit includes the village of Mesimeri, with a combined population of 10,810 (2011). The municipal unit Epanomi has an area of 91.541 km2, and the community Epanomi has an area of 78.716 km2. Epanomi has a long, historic path as it is the second oldest establishment in Macedonia (Greece) after Angelochori (as archaeologist Theocharis Pazaras indicated with his work) since the area of Epanomi has been inhabited since the neolithic period. According to the statistics of Vasil Kanchov (""Macedonia, Ethnography and Statistics""), 2.300 Greek Christians lived in the village in 1900. The town circulates its economy on tourism and farming, as it is well known among Greeks for its coasts and organized beautiful beaches (awarded annually the blue flag) easily approached from Thessaloniki. It is also known and visited for its tradition in good wine and tsipouro (a strong distilled alcoholic beverage made by fermentation of grape pomace). The local football team has recently played in the second division in Greece."

"Lavaux (French pronunciation: ​[lavo]) is a region in the canton of Vaud in Switzerland, in the district of Lavaux-Oron. Lavaux consist of 830 hectares of terraced vineyards that stretch for about 30 km along the south-facing northern shores of Lake Geneva. Although there is some evidence that vines were grown in the area in Roman times, the actual vine terraces can be traced back to the 11th century, when Benedictine and Cistercian monasteries controlled the area. It benefits from a temperate climate, but the southern aspect of the terraces with the reflection of the sun in the lake and the stone walls gives a mediterranean character to the region. The main wine grape variety grown here is the Chasselas."
"Tokaj wine region (Hungarian: Tokaji borvidék Slovak: Vinohradnícka oblasť Tokaj) or Tokaj-Hegyalja wine region (short Tokaj-Hegyalja or Hegyalja) is a historical wine region located in northeastern Hungary and southeastern Slovakia. It is also one of the seven larger wine regions of Hungary (Hungarian: Tokaji borrégió). Hegyalja means ""foothills"" in Hungarian, and this was the original name of the region. The region consists of 28 named villages and 11,149 hectares of classified vineyards, of which an estimated 5,500 are currently planted. Tokaj has been declared a World Heritage Site in 2002 under the name Tokaj Wine Region Historic Cultural Landscape. However, its fame long predated this distinction because it is the origin of Tokaji aszú wine, the world's oldest botrytized wine. Due to the Treaty of Trianon, a smaller part of the historical wine region now belongs to Slovakia."
"The Hunter Valley is one of Australia's best known wine regions. Located in the state of New South Wales, the region has played a pivotal role in the history of Australian wine as one of the first wine regions planted in the early 19th century. Hunter Valley Semillon is widely considered the iconic wine of the region but the Hunter produces wine from a variety of grapes including Shiraz, Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon and Verdelho. Under Australia's wine appellation system, the Hunter Valley zone Australian Geographical Indication (GI) covers the entire catchment of the Hunter River and its tributaries. Within that, the Hunter region is almost as large, and includes most of the wine-producing areas, excluding the metropolitan area of Newcastle and nearby coastal areas, some national parks, and any land that was in the (at the western heights of the catchment). There are three named subregions in the Hunter region. These are the , Broke Fordwich and subregions. The Lower Hunter Valley is not strictly defined, but in general includes the Pokolbin subregion, along with the districts around Wollombi, Mount View, Cessnock and Lovedale. Much of the history of Hunter was played out in this area and it is generally what is referred as the Hunter Valley ""wine country"". The majority of the Hunter Valley's most prestigious vineyards are located on the southern valley and foothills of the (part of the Great Dividing Range). The topography of the Hunter includes mostly gently sloping hills with modest gradients. The one notable exception are the vineyards of Mount View just west of the town of Cessnock. The terrain of the Upper Hunter is noticeably flatter as the Goulburn River and other tributaries of the Hunter River dominate the area. The greater river system of the Hunter, which includes the Goulburn and important tributaries such as Giants Creek, do provide needed irrigation for areas such as the Upper Hunter that can be prone to drought condition. The success of the Hunter Valley wine industry has been dominated by its proximity to Sydney with its settlement and plantings in the 19th century fuelled by the trade network that linked the valley to the city. The steady demand of consumers from Sydney continues to drive much of the Hunter Valley wine industry, including a factor in the economy by the tourism industry."

"Valle de Uco is a viticultural region southwest of Mendoza, in Argentina. Situated along the Tunuyán River, the Uco Valley is widely considered one of the top wine regions in Mendoza, and all of Argentina. The annual average temperature is 14 °C (57 °F) and altitudes range from 900–1,200 metres (3,000–3,900 ft) above sea level. The combination of high elevation, alluvial soils, irrigation sourced from the Andes Mountains, a long growing season with over 250 sunny days a year, little rain and vast temperature differences between day and night are all conducive to growing quality wine grapes. These climate and geography elements come together to provide excellent fruit ripening and concentration, developing colors, aromas, flavors and textures resulting in wines that are deep in color, intense in aromas and rich in flavors. The Uco Valley figures prominently in the Argentina Wine Route for tourist visitors. Traditionally, the varietals grown in this area are Sémillon and Malbec; together with Bonarda and Barbera in a smaller amount."

"Bennett Valley is a northwest- to southeast-trending valley in Sonoma County, California, US, approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) wide in its northwestern portion, where the southeast extremity of Santa Rosa, California is located. The axis of the valley floor slopes 40 feet (12 m) per mile (a gradient of 0.008 or 7.6 m per km) from the pinched central portion of the valley, where knolls divide the northwestern from the southeastern segment of the valley. Bennett Valley is drained by Matanzas Creek which is incised into the valley floor; an unnamed stream and Spring Creek drain into Matanzas Creek from the east side of Bennett Valley below the Matanzas Creek Reservoir. A flood-control reservoir on Matanzas Creek in the central portion of the valley collects water from the drainage of the upper portion of the valley. Precipitation in the valley varies from approximately 35 to 40 inches (90 to 100 cm) per year. The latter amount falls on Taylor Mountain, located immediately above Bennett Valley, in an outlier spur of the Sonoma Mountains sometimes called the Los Gullicos Range. Rainfall occurs primarily during winters (November to April), separated by warm dry summers. Bennett Valley is accessed chiefly via Bennett Valley Road, which traverses the valley floor to connect southeast Santa Rosa with Warm Springs Road in Glen Ellen."

"Vitis vinifera, the common grape vine, is a species of flowering plant, native to the Mediterranean region, Central Europe, and southwestern Asia, from Morocco and Portugal north to southern Germany and east to northern Iran. There are currently between 5,000 and 10,000 varieties of Vitis vinifera grapes though only a few are of commercial significance for wine and table grape production. The wild grape is often classified as V. vinifera subsp. sylvestris (in some classifications considered Vitis sylvestris), with V. vinifera subsp. vinifera restricted to cultivated forms. Domesticated vines have hermaphrodite flowers, but subsp. sylvestris is dioecious (male and female flowers on separate plants) and pollination is required for fruit to develop. The grape is eaten fresh, processed to make wine, vinegar or juice, or dried to produce raisins. Cultivars of Vitis vinifera form the basis of the majority of wines produced around the world. All of the familiar wine varieties belong to Vitis vinifera, which is cultivated on every continent except for Antarctica, and in all the major wine regions of the world."
"Vitis × labruscana is a subgroup of grapes originating from a hybridization of Vitis labrusca and Vitis vinifera. Popular examples include Concord and Niagara grapes, which comprise nearly all grapes processed for juice or jelly in the United States. Such cultivars are frequently referred to as ""labrusca"", however many are as little as half Vitis labrusca in their pedigree. Another common term, arguably more accurate, is ""labrusca-type"". These varieties do in fact possess many of the traits of Vitis labrusca, frequently including slipskin fruit, strong ""foxy"" flavor/odor, and large leaves with lighter colored and pubescent undersides. Most are self-fertile, unlike wild Vitis labrusca. For much of the history of American viticulture, such varieties made up the bulk of production, particularly outside of California. In more recent years, however, the introduction of chemical pesticides and the development of rootstocks able to tolerate phylloxera have reduced their importance considerably in favor Vitis vinifera. Nonetheless, such cultivars, particularly Concord, remain a significant and vital part of the North American and Japanese grape industries."

"Cuyo is the wine-producing, mountainous region of central-west Argentina. Historically it comprised the provinces of San Juan, San Luis and Mendoza. The modern New Cuyo includes both Cuyo proper and the province of La Rioja. New Cuyo is a political and economic macroregion, but culturally La Rioja is part of the North-West rather than of Cuyo. Cuyo has some of the most popular tourist attractions in Argentina and the highest mountain massifs in the Andes, including Aconcagua itself, the highest peak outside Asia, and the Ischigualasto Provincial Park. The soil is arid and reddish, crossed by few rivers. Most of the rivers are fed by the thawing of snow on the peaks, and their volume of water increases considerably in spring. The Desaguadero River is the main collector, receiving waters from the Bermejo, Vinchina and Salado before reaching the Colorado River. Viticulture is one of the main activities of the area. The wine production of the region represents almost 80% of national production, and the wines are highly considered in the world. Olives, potatoes, tomatoes and some fruits are also cultivated, and there is production of sweets and preserved foodstuffs. Quarrying and oil exploitation are other important industries. The cities and towns in the region are characterised by colonial low houses and churches, and narrow streets, contrasting in the principal cities with the modern parts. The Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, founded in 1939, is the most important within these provinces, and has its campus in Mendoza, but has faculties as far as Río Negro.

"Mosel (German: [ˈmoːzl̩]) is one of 13 German wine regions (Weinbaugebiete) for quality wines (Qualitätswein, formerly QbA and Prädikatswein), and takes its name from the Mosel River (French: Moselle. Luxembourgish: Musel.). Before 1 August 2007 the region was called Mosel-Saar-Ruwer, but changed to a name that was considered more consumer-friendly. The wine region is Germany's third largest in terms of production but some consider it the leading region in terms of international prestige. The region covers the valleys of the rivers Mosel, Saar, and Ruwer from near the mouth of the Mosel at Koblenz and upstream to the vicinity of Trier in the federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate. The area is known for the steep slopes of the region's vineyards overlooking the river. At 65° degrees incline, the steepest recorded vineyard in the world is the Calmont vineyard located on the Mosel and belonging to the village of Bremm, and therefore referred to as Bremmer Calmont. The Mosel is mainly famous for its wines made from the Riesling grape, but Elbling and Müller-Thurgau also contribute to the production, among others. In the past two decades red wine production, especially from the Spätburgunder (Pinot noir), has increased in the Mosel and throughout the German vignoble and has become of increasing interest to the international wine community. Because of the northerly location of the Mosel, the Riesling wines are often light, tending to lower alcohol, crisp and high in acidity, and often exhibit ""flowery"" rather than or in addition to ""fruity"" aromas. Its most common vineyard soil is derived in the main from various kinds of slate deposits, which tend to give the wines a transparent, mineralic aspect, that often exhibit great depth of flavor. In the current era of climate change much work has been done to improve and gain acceptance for completely dry (""Trocken"") Rieslings in this region, so that most of the more famous makers have found acceptance for such wines, particularly in Europe."
"The South Tyrolean Unterland (German: Südtiroler Unterland) or Bozen Unterland (Bozner Unterland; Italian: Bassa Atesina) is a section of the Etschtal valley stretching from the regional capital Bolzano (Bozen) down the Adige (Etsch) river to Tramin and Salorno (Salurn). The area is known for its history, particularly regarding Rhaetic, Roman, and Germanic archaeological sites; its trilingualism (German, Ladin, and Italian), and its viticulture; the Gewürztraminer grape originated here. The region should not be confused with the Tyrolean Unterland in the Austrian state of Tyrol."
"The Left Bank of the Rhine (German: Linkes Rheinufer, French: Rive gauche du Rhin) was the region north of Lauterbourg that is now in western Germany and was conquered during the War of the First Coalition and annexed by the First French Republic. After the French attempt to create a Cisrhenian Republic had foundered, the territories west of the Rhine were reorganised into several départements in the French First Republic. After the allied victory over Napoleon I in 1814, the territories were temporarily administered by the Central Administrative Departement (Zentralverwaltungsdepartement). The Sarre province and the district of Landau in der Pfalz, which had been French before the Napoleonic Wars, became by the final act of the Congress of Vienna ceded to the coalition's members of the coalition. The recent annexations done under the First Republic were undone. From those territories, the Bavarian Circle of the Rhine (Rheinkreis) and the Hessian province of Rhenish Hesse (Rheinhessen) were formed in 1816. The regions in the north went to Prussia and were initially part of the two provinces of Jülich-Cleves-Berg and the Grand Duchy of the Lower Rhine from which the Rhine Province emerged in 1822. The southern Left Bank territories, which had for centuries been under imperial rule in the Holy Roman Empire until they were seized by France, mostly in the 17th century, were restored to the new German Empire in 1871, after France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. Parts of the region were consolidated into the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine for 48 years (1871-1919), but Alsace Lorraine itself was allocated to France after the First World War. The remainder of the Rhineland was retained by Germany, albeit under Allied occupation from 1918 and then French occupation from 1920 until 1925."
"The Langhe (Italian pronunciation: [ˈlaŋɡe]; Langa is from old dialect Mons Langa et Bassa Langa) is a hilly area to the south and east of the river Tanaro in the province of Cuneo and in the province of Asti in Piedmont, northern Italy. It is famous for its wines, cheeses, and truffles—particularly the white truffles of Alba. The countryside as it was in the first half of the 20th century features prominently in the writings of Beppe Fenoglio and Cesare Pavese, who was born there, in Santo Stefano Belbo. On 22 June 2014, a part of the Langhe was inscribed on UNESCO's World Heritage list for its cultural landscapes, outstanding living testimony to winegrowing and winemaking traditions that stem from a long history, and that have been continuously improved and adapted up to the present day. They bear witness to an extremely comprehensive social, rural and urban realm, and to sustainable economic structures. They include a multitude of harmonious built elements that bear witness to its history and its professional practices. Its vineyards constitute an outstanding example of man’s interaction with his natural environment. Following a long and slow evolution of winegrowing expertise, the best possible adaptation of grape varieties to land with specific soil and climatic components has been carried out, which in itself is related to winemaking expertise, thereby becoming an international benchmark. The winegrowing landscape also expresses great aesthetic qualities, making it into an archetype of European vineyards. Crutin cheese is made in Langhe. In geology, the Langhian Age of the Miocene Epoch is named for the Langhe region."
"The Northland Region (Māori: Te Tai Tokerau) is the northernmost of New Zealand's 16 local government regions. New Zealanders sometimes refer to it as the Winterless North because of its mild climate. The main population centre is the city of Whangārei, and the largest town is Kerikeri. At the 2018 New Zealand census Northland recorded a surprising population growth spurt of 18.1% since the previous 2013 census, placing it as the fastest growing region of New Zealand, ahead of other strong growth regions such as the Bay of Plenty (2nd with 15%) and Waikato (3rd with 13.5%)."
The Mount Benson wine region is a wine region in the south east of South Australia located on the continental coastline about 300 kilometres (190 miles) from Adelaide and halfway between the towns of Kingston SE and Robe. Mount Benson is one of six wine growing regions that are located in the Limestone Coast wine zone.
"Victorian wine is wine made in the Australian state of Victoria. With over 600 wineries, Victoria has more wine producers than any other Australian wine-producing state but ranks third in overall wine production due to the lack of a mass bulk wine-producing area like South Australia's Riverland and New South Wales's Riverina. Viticulture has existed in Victoria since the 19th century and experienced a high point in the 1890s when the region produced more than half of all wine produced in Australia. The phylloxera epidemic that soon followed took a hard toll on the Victoria wine industry which did not fully recover till the 1950s. Today winemaking is spread out across the state and features premier wine regions such as Heathcote, Rutherglen, Pyrenees and the Yarra Valley. Single varietal wines produced in Victoria include the Australian mainstays of Shiraz and Chardonnay as well as Cabernet, Merlot and Sauvignon Blanc with increasing plantings in the late 1990s and 2000s of Viognier, Sangiovese, Pinot noir, Pinot Gris and Nebbiolo, and even the more obscure Graciano, Lagrein and Tannat. Victorian red wines are often described as more elegant than the robust styles of South Australia, although the style of wine ranges from lighter elegant Pinot Noirs to medium and full bodied Shiraz and Cabernets. Rutherglen is renowned for its distinctive Madeira-like fortified wines such as Liqueur Muscat."
"The Alpine Valleys is an Australian wine region on the western slopes of the Victorian Alps in northeast Victoria. It was registered as an Australian Geographical Indication on 29 November 1999 It is bounded to the west by the King Valley and to the north by the Beechworth wine region. The area is distinctly cooler in climate than some of the other northeast wine regions like Rutherglen. The Alpine Valleys produce grapes primarily for table wine production. The Alpine Valleys wine region includes the valleys of the Ovens, Buffalo, Buckland and Kiewa rivers. Towns in the region include Myrtleford and Bright. Small quantities of tea are grown and produced in the Alpine Valleys."
"The Yarra Valley is the region surrounding the Yarra River in Victoria, Australia. The river originates approximately 240 kilometres east of the Melbourne central business district and flows towards it and out into Port Phillip Bay. The name Yarra Valley is used in reference to the upper regions surrounding the Yarra River and generally does not encompass the lower regions including the city and suburban areas, where the topography flattens out, or the upper reaches which are in inaccessible bushland. Included in the Yarra Valley is the sub-region of the Upper Yarra Valley which encompasses the towns of the former Shire of Upper Yarra in the catchment area upstream of and including Woori Yallock. The Yarra Valley is a popular day-trip and tourist area, featuring a range of natural features and agricultural produce, as well as the Lilydale to Warburton Rail Trail. The Yarra Valley is host to a thriving wine growing industry. The area's relatively cool climate makes it particularly suited to the production of high-quality chardonnay, pinot noir and sparkling wine. Yarra Valley towns fall under the Nillumbik and Yarra Ranges Shire Councils. Major towns include Coldstream, Yarra Glen, Healesville and Warburton. It is also the filming location for the first two seasons of The Saddle Club."
"The Heathcote Wine Region of Victoria, Australia, is nestled between the Goulburn Valley and Bendigo regions. The region is famous for its Shiraz production."
"The Peel region is one of the nine regions of Western Australia. It is located on the west coast of Western Australia, about 75 km (47 mi) south of the state capital, Perth. It consists of the City of Mandurah, and the Shires of Boddington, Murray, Serpentine-Jarrahdale and Waroona. It has a total area of 6,648 km². In 2017, Peel had a population of 136,854, of which over sixty percent lived in Mandurah. In June 2019 the total population for the constituent LGAs was 142,960 within an area of 5516.3 sq km. The economy of the Peel region is dominated by mining and mineral processing; the area has large reserves of bauxite, some gold and mineral sands, and an aluminium refinery. Other important economic sectors include agriculture and a substantial equine industry. Before European settlement, the Peel region was inhabited by Indigenous Australians, specifically the Pindjarup dialect group of the Noongar people. Shortly after the establishment of the Swan River Colony in 1829, part of the northern coastal area of the Peel region was settled under a program known as the Peel Settlement Scheme, organised by Thomas Peel. However the scheme was poorly administered, and many settlers died of malnutrition in the first few months. The surviving settlers abandoned the area, with some moving inland where they found fertile soil. In 1846, Western Australia's first mining operation was established at Yarrabah (near present-day Mundijong), mining lead, silver and zinc. The Jarrahdale timber mill, established in May 1872, became the state's largest timber operation, and led to the development of service centres for the timber industry along the Perth–Picton railway line at Mundijong, Waroona and Dwellingup. In recent times, the timber industry has declined, but the establishment of alumina refineries at Pinjarra and Wagerup, and gold mines at Boddington, have helped the local economy."

"Tursan is a Vin délimité de qualité supérieure (VDQS) for wine in South West France since 1958 (decree of 11 July 1958, last modified 26 February 2003)."
"The Bergerac wine-growing region, a subregion of South West France around the town of Bergerac in the Dordogne department, comprises 93 communes. Its boundaries correspond more or less with those of the Arrondissement of Bergerac, immediately east of the Bordeaux wine region. 1,200 wine-growers cultivate an area of 12,000 hectares (30,000 acres). The Bergerac area contains 13 Appellations d'origine contrôlées (AOCs) for red, white (dry, medium-sweet and sweet) and rosé wines. The vineyards extend across the southern part of the Dordogne department, the Arrondissement (urban district) of Bergerac. Bergerac soil also features excellent drainage as a result of its proximity to the Dordogne River. Approximately fifteen per cent of Bergerac AOC wine is sold outside France mainly to Great Britain, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands."
"Côtes du Rhône is a wine-growing Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) for the Rhône wine region of France, which may be used throughout the region, also in those areas which are covered by other AOCs. In a limited part of the region, the Côtes-du-Rhône Villages AOC may be used, in some cases together with the name of the commune. Côtes du Rhône are the basic AOC wines of the Rhône region, and exist as red, white and rosé wines, generally dominated by Grenache for reds and rosés, or Grenache blanc for whites."
"Stargarder Land is a small region for country wine in northeastern Germany, which was defined in an amendment to the German wine law on 4 March 2004. Located in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, approximately 100 km north of Berlin, it is by far the northernmost official wine-growing area of Germany. The designation Mecklenburger Landwein is used for country wines from this region. In two respects, Stargarder Land is different from all other wine regions in Germany. First, the 13 well-established German wine regions (usually referred to as Anbaugebiete) are all allowed to produce wine of all quality levels of the German wine classification, while Stargarder Land is only allowed to produce wines belonging to the lower part – Tafelwein (table wine) and Landwein (country wine) – and not the higher ""quality wine"" categories Qualitätswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete (QbA) and Prädikatswein. Since the name of the wine region is always displayed prominently on the labels of German quality wines, but not the lesser categories, this is a significant difference. Second, Stargarder Land is only 3.7 hectares (9.1 acres) in size, which would be small even for a single vineyard site in other regions. The smallest of the 13 regions for quality wine is Saxony, which in 2006 had 416 hectares (1,030 acres) of vineyards, and the largest was Rheinhessen with 26,281 hectares (64,940 acres). Thus, Stargarder Land is something of a newly created oddity in the German wine regulations, and the region is generally not considered as Germany's 14th Anbaugebiet, but rather as a smaller district which leads its own existence outside the regions. The region's wine is produced by two small winemaking cooperatives, one in (Schloss Rattey) operating 3.5 hectares (8.6 acres) and one in Burg Stargard on 0.2 hectares (0.49 acres). The amount of wine produced is so small that it is not sold commercially, but rather handed out as dividend to the members of the cooperatives."
"Valpolicella (UK: /ˌvælpɒlɪˈtʃɛlə/, US: /ˌvɑːlpoʊl-, ˌvælpoʊl-/, Italian: [ˌvalpoliˈtʃɛlla]) is a viticultural zone of the province of Verona, Italy, east of Lake Garda. The hilly agricultural and marble-quarrying region of small holdings north of the Adige is famous for wine production. Valpolicella ranks just after Chianti in total Italian Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) wine production. The red wine known as Valpolicella is typically made from three grape varieties: Corvina Veronese, Rondinella, and Molinara. A variety of wine styles is produced in the area, including a recioto dessert wine and Amarone, a strong wine made from dried grapes. Most basic Valpolicellas are light, fragrant table wines produced in a novello style, similar to Beaujolais nouveau and released only a few weeks after harvest. Valpolicella Classico is made from grapes grown in the original Valpolicella production zone. Valpolicella Superiore is aged at least one year and has an alcohol content of at least 12 percent. Valpolicella Ripasso is a form of Valpolicella Superiore made with partially dried grape skins that have been left over from fermentation of Amarone or recioto. Winemaking in the region has existed since at least the time of the ancient Greeks. The name ""Valpolicella"" appeared in charters of the mid-12th century, combining two valleys previously thought of independently. Its etymology is likely from the Latin vallis pulicellae (""valley of river deposits""). Today Valpolicella's economy is heavily based on wine production. The region, colloquially called the ""pearl of Verona"", has also been a preferred location for rural vacation villas. Seven comuni compose Valpolicella: Pescantina, San Pietro in Cariano, Negrar, Marano di Valpolicella, Fumane, Sant’Ambrogio di Valpolicella and Sant’Anna d’Alfaedo. The Valpolicella production zone was enlarged to include regions of the surrounding plains when Valpolicella achieved DOC status in 1968. In December 2009, the production of Amarone and recioto dessert wines within the Valpolicella DOC received their own separate Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) status."
Western Cape is a Geographical Unit within the Wine of Origin classification system of South African wine. Corresponding to the province of Western Cape it includes most of the vineyards in South Africa.
"Rioja [ˈrjoxa] is a wine region in Spain, with denominación de origen calificada (D.O.Ca., ""Qualified Designation of Origin,"" the highest category in Spanish wine regulation). Rioja wine is made from grapes grown in the autonomous communities of La Rioja and Navarre, and the Basque province of Álava. Rioja is further subdivided into three zones: Rioja Alta, Rioja Oriental and Rioja Alavesa. Many wines have traditionally blended fruit from all three regions, though there is a slow growth in single-zone wines."
"New World wines are those wines produced outside the traditional winegrowing areas of Europe and the Middle East, in particular from Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States (primarily California). The phrase connotes a distinction between these ""New World"" wines and those wines produced in ""Old World"" countries with a long-established history of wine production – most notably, France, Italy, Germany, Spain and Portugal."
"Italian wine is produced in every region of Italy, home to some of the oldest wine-producing regions in the world. Italy is the world's largest producer of wine, with an area of 702,000 hectares (1,730,000 acres) under vineyard cultivation, and contributing a 2013–2017 annual average of 48.3 million hl of wine. In 2018 Italy accounted for 19 percent of global production, ahead of France (17 percent) and Spain (15 percent). Italian wine is both exported around the world and popular domestically among Italians, who consume an average of 42 litres per capita, ranking fifth in world wine consumption. Etruscans and Greek settlers produced wine in Italy before the Romans planted their own vineyards in the 2nd century AD. The Romans greatly increased Italy's area under vine using efficient viticultural and winemaking methods, and pioneered large-scale production and storage techniques such as barrel-making and bottling."
"Vinsobres is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) for red wine in the southern part of the Rhône wine region of France, situated around Vinsobres. Vinsobres was previously a part of the Côtes-du-Rhône Villages AOC. On 17 February 2006, it was created as a separate AOC, and therefore received the status of a ""Rhône Cru"". The wines must contain at least 50% Grenache and 25% Syrah and/or Mourvèdre. Historically, this area has a strong tradition in olive cultivation, and some current vineyards have been converted from growing olives."
"Bourgogne Aligoté is an Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) for white wine produced from the Aligoté grape variety in the region of Burgundy in France. The AOC was created in 1937. Approximately 1,700 hectares (4,200 acres) of Burgundy vineyards were devoted to the production of Bourgogne Aligoté in 2007, and the average annual production over the period 2003–2007 was 107,470 hectoliter."
"Bourgogne Passe-Tout-Grains is an Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) for wine from the region of Burgundy in France. Most Bourgogne Passe-Tout-Grains, which is sometimes written unhyphenated as Bourgogne Passetoutgrains, is red although rosé wine may also be produced. Unlike other Burgundy wines, which are primarily produced from a single grape variety, Bourgogne Passe-Tout-Grains is essentially a cuvée of Gamay and Pinot noir."
"Coteaux Bourguignons is an Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) for white, red and rosé wine from the region of Burgundy in France. In late 2011, it replaced the earlier appellation Bourgogne Grand Ordinaire. The name Coteaux Bourguignons translates as ""Burgundian hills""."
"Rosé des Riceys is a French wine Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) in the three villages of Les Riceys, a commune in the Aube département in the Champagne province of France. The wines are all rosé, produced from the pinot noir grape. They are either fermented in stainless steel tanks for early drinking or in wood allowing longer ageing. They have a distinctive taste known to the French as goût des Riceys.Les Riceys is the only wine-growing area to have three AOCs: AOC Champagne, AOC Côteaux Champenois red wine and AOC Rosé de Riceys."
"Old World wine refers primarily to wine made in Europe but can also include other regions of the Mediterranean basin with long histories of winemaking such as North Africa and the Near East. The phrase is often used in contrast to ""New World wine"" which refers primarily to wines from New World wine regions such as the United States, Australia, South America and South Africa. The term ""Old World wine"" does not refer to a homogeneous style with ""Old World wine regions"" like Austria, France, Italy, Portugal, and Spain each making vastly different styles of wine even within their own borders. Rather, the term is used to describe general differences in viticulture and winemaking philosophies between the Old World regions where tradition and the role of terroir lead versus the New World where science and the role of the winemaker are more often emphasized. In recent times, the and advent of have lessened the distinction between the two terms with winemakers in one region being able to produce wines that can display the traits of the other region—i.e. an ""Old World style"" wine being produced in a New World wine region like California or Chile and vice versa. ""Old World"" can also mean a wine style made for centuries by small winemakers intended to be consumed as a daily beverage to accompany a meal. These food and wine ""pairings,"" so famous today (e.g. Chianti and Italian food) developed over generations by trial and error. The small village winemaker succeeded or failed on his wine's reputation as an acceptable ""table"" wine, be it highly expensive or budget priced. By comparison, ""New World"" wines, while also being food friendly, are created to meet the tastes of contemporary wine drinkers. Contemporary wine drinkers, especially those in the large U.S. market, consume wine as a stand alone beverage as much as a beverage to accompany a meal. Thus, the immediate ""taste"" is the overwhelming criteria by which a new-world wine is judged by the contemporary wine consumer."
"The Buenos Aires Province has become a producer of premium wines during the first decade of the 21st century. Vineyards are located at the southern part of the province, specially around Médanos. The activity was pioneered in lands previously dedicated to garlic and pastures. Wine from Médanos won a Silver Medal in the 2009 Decanter World Wine Awards, the world's largest wine contest celebrated in London."
"Mendoza Province is Argentina's most important wine region, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the country's entire wine production. Located in the eastern foothills of the Andes, in the shadow of Aconcagua, vineyards are planted at some of the highest altitudes in the world, with the average site located 600–1,100 metres (2,000–3,600 ft) above sea level. The principal wine producing areas fall into two main departments-Maipú and Luján, which includes Argentina's first delineated appellation established in 1993 in Luján de Cuyo. The pink-skinned grapes of Criolla Grande and Cereza account for more than a quarter of all plantings but Malbec is the region's most important planting, followed closely by Cabernet Sauvignon, Tempranillo and Chardonnay. Mendoza is considered the heart of the winemaking industry in Argentina with the vast majority of large wineries located in the provincial capital of Mendoza."
"The Argentina Wine Route (Spanish: Ruta del Vino) is an enotourism belt in Argentina that covers approximately 2,000 km (1,243 mi) and traverses several provinces and wine producing regions of varying altitudes and geographical features. Argentina has an estimated 2,000 wineries, many of which now offer vineyard and winery tours, as well as hospitality accommodations for the country's growing number of wine related tourists. Argentina is the largest producer of wine in South America, and the 5th largest producer of wine in the world."
"Tasmanian wine is wine produced in the Australian state of Tasmania. Located at a more southerly latitude than the rest of Australia's wine regions, Tasmania has a cooler climate and the potential to make distinctly different wines than in the rest of the country. The area grows primarily Pinot noir, Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc, with some smaller plantings of Riesling, Pinot gris and Cabernet Sauvignon. Global warming has had positive effects on the Tasmanian wine industry, allowing most of the grapes in the past few vintages (as of 2005) to ripen fully and produce more vibrant wine."
"Wachau is one of Austria's most established and notable wine regions, specializing in dry wines made from Riesling and Grüner Veltliner. Located in Lower Austria along the Danube, west of Vienna and Krems an der Donau, it is one of the westernmost wine producing regions in Austria with only a few scattered plantings in Tyrol being further west. While most of Austria follows a wine classification systems based on ripeness and harvest must weight that parallels the German wine classification system, Wachau wines have a unique classification system. The three for Wachau wine include Steinfeder for wines up to 11.5% alcohol level, Federspiel for wines between 11.5–12.5% and Smaragd that must have a minimum of 12.5% alcohol level. Despite its renown, the Wachau is a small wine region that usually accounts for only around 3% of Austria's wine production."
"Uhudler is a unique wine from Austria, which originates in the region (see Burgenland). In appearance it is often a rosé colour, but is also made as a white wine. It has intense flavours of strawberry and black currants, a characteristic taste often called ""foxy"" in wine parlance. The grape varieties used are highly resistant to phylloxera and other diseases; as a result they do not often have to be sprayed with pesticides. They also require little fertilization because of their vigorous growth."
"Austrian wines are mostly dry white wines (often made from the Grüner Veltliner grape), though some sweeter white wines (such as dessert wines made around the Neusiedler See) are also produced. About 30% of the wines are red, made from Blaufränkisch (also known as Lemberger, or as Kékfrankos in neighbouring Hungary), Pinot noir and locally bred varieties such as Zweigelt. Four thousand years of winemaking history counted for little after the ""antifreeze scandal"" of 1985, when it was revealed that some wine brokers had been adulterating their wines with diethylene glycol. The scandal destroyed the market for Austrian wine and compelled Austria to tackle low standards of bulk wine production, and reposition itself as a producer of quality wines. The country is also home to Riedel, makers of some of the most expensive wine glasses in the world. Some of the best producers of Austria include Weingut Bründlmayer, Weingut F.X. Pichler and Weingut Franz Hirtzberger, Weingut Hutter, Weingut Eigl and Wellanschitz."
"British Columbia wine is Canadian wine produced in the province of British Columbia. Wines made from 100 percent British Columbia grapes can qualify for classification under one of British Columbia's two classification systems, depending on the variety, the wine-making techniques employed, and various other restrictions. Originally, the British Columbia Wine Institute handled regulation and marketing of the Vintners Quality Alliance (VQA), which is also an appellation system. More recently, the British Columbia Wine Authority was formed by the provincial government to regulate part of the industry. It created a second classification, ""Wines of Distinction"", to be also from 100 percent British Columbia grapes, but with less stringent quality control. In practice, it has strengthened the VQA classification. Wines which are neither labelled VQA or Wine of Distinction, and from certain producers (given special rights under the 1988 Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement), can use foreign bulk wine to produce a third category of wine which is labelled as Cellared in Canada. Significant parts of the wine industry, and respected wine writers in Canada and abroad, are quite concerned about this practice. There are several classifications of winery, represented by numerous organizations. The smallest are known as ""farmgate"" wineries. ""Land"" wineries are mid-sized operations."
"The Okanagan Valley wine region, located within the region of the same name in the British Columbia Interior, is Canada's second-largest wine producing area. Along with the nearby Similkameen Valley, the approximately 8,619 acres (3,488 hectares) of vineyards planted in the Okanagan (2018 data) account for more than 80% of all wine produced in British Columbia, and are second in economic importance for wine production to the Niagara Peninsula of Ontario. Some 182 licensed wineries existed from south to north in the valley in 2018, with many situated along the 135 km (84 mi)-long Okanagan Lake and its tributaries and downstream lakes, including Skaha Lake, Vaseux Lake, and Osoyoos Lake. The Okanagan has diverse terrain that features many different microclimates and vineyard soil types, contributing characteristics which are part of an Okanagan terroir. Wine production in the Okanagan dates to the 1850s, with the establishment of Okanagan Mission and the planting of grapevines to supply sacramental wines. In the early 20th century, prohibition in Canada wiped out many of the Okanagan's earliest wineries and the commercial wine industry in the area was not revived until the 1930s. From this time through the mid-1970s, the Okanagan wine industry was based entirely on the production of fruit wines and those produced from hybrid grapes. The Okanagan wine industry has been developed to include dining experiences for pairing wine with farm-to-plate foods."
"The Cowichan Valley is a region around the Cowichan River, Cowichan Bay and Cowichan Lake on Vancouver Island, in British Columbia, Canada. There is some debate as to the origin of the name Cowichan, which many believe to be an anglicized form of the First Nations tribal name Quw'utsun."
"Quebec wine is Canadian wine made in the province of Quebec. The grape varieties grown in Quebec, both white and red, all have common qualities needed by the harshness of the winter season, including resistance to winter temperatures, resistance to spring freezes and being early ripening. Some 40 varieties are grown in Quebec, with the most commonly planted being Maréchal Foch, Frontenac, De Chaunac, Vidal and Seyval blanc. Quebec wine makers have developed a large array of products including dry, semi-dry and fortified wines (including Vin doux naturel styles). Additionally the region produces ice wines, late harvest wines, sparkling wines and fruit wines. Quebec counts six regions where vines are cultivated. They are the Eastern Townships, Montérégie, Québec, Basses Laurentides, Lanaudière, and Centre-du-Québec."
"The Southern Chilean Wine Region or The South is one of the five principal wine regions of Chile. It encompasses all wine-growing areas in of Bío Bío Region and Araucanía Region. The South wine region is composed of three minor wine districts; Itata Valley, Bío Bío Valley and Malleco Valley."
"The Elqui Valley is a wine region centered on Elqui River in northern Chile. The Elqui Valley Denomination of Origin (DO) is defined by the Chilean appellation system, the legally defined and protected geographical indication used to identify where the grapes for a wine were grown. The region lies 400 km (250 mi) north of Santiago, at the southern end of the Atacama Desert in the Coquimbo region. It is known for producing table grapes and other fruits, as well as pisco brandy, Chile’s most popular liquor. It is considered the most commercially viable wine-producing region of northern Chile. The region’s vineyards extend from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the Andes Mountains in the east, and rise to an elevation of 2,000 meters above sea level (6,500 feet). Wine production began in the Elqui Valley in the 1990s when Chilean wine producers began to look at potential viticulture sites outside the Chilean Central Valley. Since then, 286 hectares (710 acres) of vines have been planted, mostly along the River Elqui valley, where grape growers have access to high-quality water for irrigation. The region has clay, silt and chalk soil, and is characterized by a sunny, desert-like climate, less than 70 millimetres (2.8 in) of annual rainfall, dry rocky terrain, steep valleys and temperate hills cooled by strong winds from the Pacific Ocean and the Andes Mountains, producing excellent results for varietals like Syrah."
"Aconcagua is one of the five principal wine regions of Chile. It encompasses all winegrowing areas in Valparaíso Region. The Aconcagua wine region is composed of four minor wine districts; Casablanca Valley, , Aconcagua Valley and .""Aconcagua Valley"" is a wine-producing region located 65 km (40 mi) north of Santiago in the east of the Valparaíso Region. It is a Denomination of Origin (DO) defined by the Chilean Appellation system, the legally defined and protected geographical indication used to identify where the grapes for a wine were grown. Aconcagua Valley takes its name both from the province where it is located, San Felipe de Aconcagua, and also from the Aconcagua mountain, the highest peak in the Andes at 6,956 meters (22,828 feet). The snow-capped peak of Aconcagua and the surrounding mountains delivers essential melt water to the valley below. The small, 1,098-hectare winegrowing area is well known for its red wines, which have earned international acclaim, with Vina Errázuriz's “Seña” placing ahead of both Château Lafite and Château Margaux in blind tasting held in Berlin in 2004, a milestone for the Chilean wine industry.Although the valley is primarily known for the red grapes grown in its interior, white grapes are also now being grown in new coastal plantations."
"Moselle wine is produced in three countries along the Moselle river: France, Luxembourg (the Musel) and Germany (the Mosel). Moselle wines are mainly white and are made in some of the coldest climates used for commercial winemaking."
"Rully wine is produced in the communes of Rully and Chagny in the Côte Chalonnaise subregion of Burgundy. The Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) Rully may be used for red and white wine with respectively Pinot noir and Chardonnay as the main grape variety. Around two-thirds of the production consists of white wine, and around one-third is red. There are 23 Premier Cru vineyards within Rully AOC, but no Grand Cru vineyards exist in this part of Burgundy. The AOC was created in 1939."
"Aloxe-Corton wine is produced in the communes of Aloxe-Corton and Ladoix-Serrigny in Côte de Beaune of Burgundy. The appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) Aloxe-Corton may be used for red and white wine with respectively Pinot noir and Chardonnay as the main grape variety. The production consists of almost only red wine, around 98 per cent, and only around two per cent white wine. The southern and eastern side of the Corton hill is located in the commune of Aloxe-Corton, including vineyards of all three Grand Cru AOCs of the hill; Corton, Corton-Charlemagne and Charlemagne, and its northeastern part in the commune of Ladoix-Serrigny. The major part of the Corton hill is located within Aloxe-Corton. The AOC was created in 1938. In 2008, there was 117.78 hectares (291.0 acres) of vineyard surface in production for Aloxe-Corton wine at village and Premier Cru level, and 4,382 hectoliter of wine was produced, of which 4,301 hectoliter red wine and 81 hectoliter white wine. Only some 1.40 hectares (3.5 acres) of this area was used for the white wines in 2007. The total amount produced corresponds to close to 600,000 bottles, of which around 10,000 bottles of white wine. For white wines, the AOC regulations allow both Chardonnay and Pinot blanc to be used, but most wines are 100% Chardonnay. The AOC regulations also allow up to 15 per cent total of Chardonnay, Pinot blanc and Pinot gris as accessory grapes in the red wines, but this not very often practiced. The allowed base yield is 40 hectoliter per hectare of red wine and 45 hectoliter per hectare for white wine. The grapes must reach a maturity of at least 10.5 per cent potential alcohol for village-level red wine, 11.0 per cent for village-level white wine and Premier Cru red wine, and 11.5 per cent for Premier Cru white wine. Aloxe-Corton is featured in the Fawlty Towers episode The Hotel Inspectors."
"Fixin wine is produced in the communes of Fixin and Brochon in the Côte de Nuits subregion of Burgundy. The Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) Fixin may be used for red and white wine with respectively Pinot noir and Chardonnay as the main grape variety. The production of red wine dominates greatly, with around 96 per cent, and only around four per cent white wine. There are no Grand Cru vineyards with these communes."
"Gevrey-Chambertin wine is produced in the communes of Gevrey-Chambertin and Brochon in the Côte de Nuits subregion of Burgundy. The Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) Gevrey-Chambertin may be used only for red wine with Pinot noir as the main grape variety. There are nine Grand Cru vineyards within the commune of Gevrey-Chambertin, Chambertin and eight others called Chambertin in combination with something else, such as Chapelle-Chambertin. While Gevrey-Chambertin also has several highly regarded Premier Cru vineyards, it has a particularly large amount of vineyards at the village level for a Côte de Nuits appellation. This is because the vineyards of the AOC stretch further to the east (beyond the N74 road) than in most neighbouring AOCs."
"Fins Bois is a wine producing sub-region within the Cognac appellation, geographically surrounding the sub-regions of Grande Champagne, Petite Champagne and Borderies, and which falls within both the Charente and Charente-Maritime departments in South-West France, just north of Bordeaux. Fins Bois is regarded as producing fine (fins) quality eaux-de-vie – though ranked behind those listed above – and is widely used as either a base- or filler- eaux-de-vie in many Cognac blends. While the major brands usually produce blends of several crus, many smaller producers produce single cru blends of various ages. Examples of such producers who release Cru Fins Bois include A. de Fussigny, Chateau de Beaulon and Jean Grosperrin. Fins Bois eaux-de-vies are characterised by their floral, fruity softness which adds good complexity and body to blends, but without the structure to age well as an exclusive cru blend."
"Languedoc-Roussillon wine, including the vin de pays labeled Vin de Pays d'Oc, is produced in southern France. While ""Languedoc"" can refer to a specific historic region of France and Northern Catalonia, usage since the 20th century (especially in the context of wine) has primarily referred to the northern part of the Languedoc-Roussillon région of France, an area which spans the Mediterranean coastline from the French border with Spain to the region of Provence. The area has around 700,000 acres (2,800 km2) under vines and is the single biggest wine-producing region in the world, being responsible for more than a third of France's total wine production. In 2001, the region produced more wine than the United States."
"Anjou wine is produced in the Loire Valley wine region of France near the city of Angers. The wines of region are often grouped together with the wines of nearby Saumur as ""Anjou-Saumur"". Along with the wines produced further east in Touraine, Anjou-Saumur make what is collectively known as the ""Middle Loire"" (as opposed to the ""Upper Loire"" which includes the wine regions of Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé. Within the Anjou wine region are several Appellation d'origine contrôlées (AOCs) responsible for a broad spectrum of wines including still red, white and rosé produced with varying levels of sweetness. Extending across the Deux-Sèvres, Maine-et-Loire and Vienne départements, the generic Anjou AOC appellation and its various sub-appellations encompasses vineyards across more than 151 communes. Wine expert Tom Stevenson describes the wines of the area as being a ""microcosm of the Loire Valley"", featuring wines made from every grape variety and in almost every style produced in the entire Loire wine region. Among the wines of Anjou, Savennières is noted for its dry Chenin blanc wines and the Coteaux du Layon for its sweet dessert wines that includes the botrytized wines of Bonnezeaux and Quarts de Chaume. Various rosé wines are produced in the region under different AOC designation include Rosé d'Anjou, the most basic level made predominantly from Grolleau, and Cabernet d'Anjou which is usually made from Cabernet Franc or Cabernet Sauvignon. For most of its history, dry red wines have represented a small percentage of Anjou winemaking but in recent years the numbers have been steadily increasing—aided, in part, by the 1987 establishment of the Anjou-Villages AOC designation for red wines which can be made from only Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. The Gamay grape of the Beaujolais wine region has had a long history in the Anjou with its own Anjou-Gamay AOC. Grapes from around the region can go into basic Anjou blanc and Anjou Rouge AOC wines."
"Provence (Provençal) wine comes from the French wine-producing region of Provence in southeast France. The Romans called the area provincia nostra (""our province""), giving the region its name. Just south of the Alps, it was the first Roman province outside Italy. Wine has been made in this region for at least 2,600 years, ever since the ancient Greeks founded the city of Marseille in 600 BC. Throughout the region's history, viticulture and winemaking have been influenced by the cultures that have been present in Provence, which include the Ancient Greeks, Romans, Gauls, Catalans and Savoyards. These diverse groups introduced a large variety of grapes to the region, including grape varieties of Greek and Roman origin as well as Spanish, Italian and traditional French wine grapes. Today the region is known predominantly for its rosé wine, though wine critics such as Tom Stevenson believe that region's best wines are the spicy, full-flavoured red wines. Rosé wine currently accounts for more than half of the production of Provençal wine, with red wine accounting for about a third of the region's production. White wine is also produced in small quantities throughout the region with the Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) region of Cassis specializing in white wine production. The Côtes de Provence is the largest AOC followed by the Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence. The Bandol region near Toulon is one of the more internationally recognized Provençal wine regions."
"Pessac-Léognan (French: [pɛsak leɔɲɑ̃]) is a wine growing area and Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée, in the northern part of the Graves region of Bordeaux. Unlike most Bordeaux appellations, Pessac-Léognan is equally famous for both red and (dry) white wines, although red wine is still predominant. It includes the only red-wine producer outside the Haut-Médoc classified in the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855, the premier cru Château Haut-Brion, and also includes all of the châteaux listed in the 1953/59 classification of Graves. These classed growths account for a third of the wine produced in Pessac-Léognan."
"The Saint-Chinian is a French wine, from the Languedoc-Roussillon wine region of France. It is usually a blend of several grape varieties, and produced in red, rosé, and white versions. Since 1982, the name is protected by an appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC, ""controlled designation of origin""). Its terroir was named after the nearby village of Saint-Chinian."
"Burgundy wine (French: Bourgogne or vin de Bourgogne) is made in the Burgundy region of eastern France, in the valleys and slopes west of the Saône, a tributary of the Rhône. The most famous wines produced here—those commonly referred to as ""Burgundies""—are dry red wines made from pinot noir grapes and white wines made from chardonnay grapes. Red and white wines are also made from other grape varieties, such as gamay and aligoté, respectively. Small amounts of rosé and sparkling wines are also produced in the region. Chardonnay-dominated Chablis and gamay-dominated Beaujolais are formally part of the Burgundy wine region, but wines from those subregions are usually referred to by their own names rather than as ""Burgundy wines"". Burgundy has a higher number of appellations d'origine contrôlée (AOCs) than any other French region, and is often seen as the most terroir-conscious of the French wine regions. The various Burgundy AOCs are classified from carefully delineated grand cru vineyards down to more non-specific regional appellations. The practice of delineating vineyards by their terroir in Burgundy goes back to medieval times, when various monasteries played a key role in developing the Burgundy wine industry."
"Margaux is a wine growing commune and Appellation d'origine contrôlée within Haut-Médoc in Bordeaux, centred on the village of Margaux. Its leading (premier cru) château is also called Margaux. It contains 21 cru classé châteaux, more than any other commune in Bordeaux."
"Muscadet (UK: /ˈmʌskədeɪ, ˈmʊsk-/ MU(U)SK-ə-day, US: /ˌmʌskəˈdeɪ, ˌmʊsk-/ MU(U)SK-ə-DAY, French: [myskadɛ]) is a French white wine. It is made at the western end of the Loire Valley, near the city of Nantes in the Pays de la Loire region. It is made from the Melon de Bourgogne grape, often referred to simply as melon. While most appellation d'origine contrôlée wines are named after their growing region, or in Alsace after their variety, the name Muscadet refers to an alleged characteristic of the wine produced by the melon grape variety: vin qui a un goût musqué (wine with a musk-like taste). However, according to wine expert Tom Stevenson, Muscadet wines do not have much, if any, muskiness or Muscat-like flavors or aromas. The sole variety used to produce Muscadet, Melon de Bourgogne, was initially planted in the region sometime in or before the 17th century. It became dominant after a hard freeze in 1709 killed most of the region's vines. Dutch traders, who were major actors in the French wine trade, encouraged the planting of this variety; they distilled much of the wine produced into eau de vie for sale in Northern Europe. The generic Muscadet appellation, officially established in 1937, contains three regional sub-appellations: 1. 
* Muscadet-Sèvre et Maine, officially established in 1936, covering 20,305 acres (8,217 hectares) with 21 villages in the Loire-Atlantique department and 2 in the Maine-et-Loire department. This appellation produces 80% of all Muscadets. 2. 
* Muscadet-Coteaux de la Loire, officially established in 1936, covering 467 acres (189 hectares) with 24 villages spread across the Loire-Atlantique and Maine-et-Loire departments. 3. 
* Muscadet-Côtes de Grandlieu, officially established in 1994, benefits from the Grandlieu lake's microclimate. This sub appellation covers 717 hectares with 17 villages in the Loire-Atlantique department and 2 villages in the Vendée department."
"Corsica wine is wine made on the Mediterranean island of Corsica. Located 90 km west of Italy, 170 km southeast of France and 11 km north of the island of Sardinia, the island is a territorial collectivity of France, but many of the region's winemaking traditions and its grape varieties are Italian in origin. The region's viticultural history can be traced to the island's settlement by Phoceans traders in 570 BC in what is now the commune of Aléria. In the 18th century, the island came under the control of France. Following the independence of Algeria from French rule, many Algerian Pieds-Noirs immigrated to Corsica and began planting vineyards. Between 1960 and 1976 the vineyard area in Corsica increased fourfold. In 1968, was established as Corsica's first Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC). Today, Corsica has nine AOC regions including the island-wide designation Vin de Corse AOC. The majority of the wine exported from Corsica falls under the Vin de pays designation Vin de Pays de l'Île de Beauté (Country wine from the Island of Beauty). The three leading grape varieties of the region are Nielluccio (Sangiovese), known as the spice wine of France, Sciacarello and Vermentino."
"Jura wine is French wine produced in the Jura département. Located between Burgundy and Switzerland, this cool climate wine region produces wines with some similarity to Burgundy and Swiss wine. Jura wines are distinctive and unusual wines, the most famous being vin jaune, which is made by a similar process to Sherry, developing under a flor-like strain of yeast. This is made from the local Savagnin grape variety. Other grape varieties include Poulsard, Trousseau, and Chardonnay. Other wine styles found in Jura includes a vin de paille made from Chardonnay, Poulsard and Savagnin, a sparkling Crémant du Jura made from slightly unripe Chardonnay grapes, and a vin de liqueur known as Macvin du Jura made by adding marc to halt fermentation. The renowned French chemist and biologist Louis Pasteur was born and raised in the Jura region and owned a vineyard near Arbois."
"Alsace wine or Alsatian wine (French: Vin d'Alsace; German: Elsässer Wein; Haut Rhin Alsatian: d'r Wii vum Elsàss; Bas Rhin Alsatian: de Win vum Elsàss) is produced in the Alsace region in France and is primarily white wine. Because of its Germanic influence, it is the only Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée region in France to produce mostly varietal wines, typically from similar grape varieties to those used in German wine. Along with Austria and Germany, it produces some of the most noted dry Rieslings in the world as well as highly aromatic Gewürztraminer wines. Wines are produced under three different AOCs: Alsace AOC for white, rosé and red wines, Alsace Grand Cru AOC for white wines from certain classified vineyards and Crémant d'Alsace AOC for sparkling wines. Both dry and sweet white wines are produced. In 2006, vines were grown on 15,298 hectares (37,800 acres) in 119 villages in Alsace, and 111.3 million litres of wine was produced, corresponding to 148.4 million bottles of 750 ml, generating 478.8 million euro in revenue. Of the vineyard surface, 78% was classified for the production of AOC Alsace wines, 4% for AOC Alsace Grand Cru, and 18% for AOC Crémant d'Alsace. About 90% of the wine produced is white. 25% of the production is exported, and the five largest export markets for still Alsace wine in terms of volume are Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Denmark and the United States."
"The Chablis (pronounced [ʃabli]) region is the northernmost wine district of the Burgundy region in France. The cool climate of this region produces wines with more acidity and flavors less fruity than Chardonnay wines grown in warmer climates. These wines often have a ""flinty"" note, sometimes described as ""goût de pierre à fusil"" (""tasting of gunflint""), and sometimes as ""steely"". The Chablis Appellation d'origine contrôlée is required to use Chardonnay grapes solely. The grapevines around the town of Chablis make a dry white wine renowned for the purity of its aroma and taste. In comparison with the white wines from the rest of Burgundy, Chablis wine has typically much less influence of oak. Most basic Chablis is unoaked, and vinified in stainless steel tanks. The amount of barrel maturation, if any, is a stylistic choice which varies widely among Chablis producers. Many Grand Cru and Premier Cru wines receive some maturation in oak barrels, but typically the time in barrel and the proportion of new barrels is much smaller than for white wines of Côte de Beaune."
"South West France, or in French Sud-Ouest, is a wine region in France covering several wine-producing areas situated respectively inland from, and south of, the wine region of Bordeaux. These areas, which have a total of 16,000 hectares (40,000 acres) of vineyards, consist of several discontinuous wine ""islands"" throughout the Aquitaine region (where Bordeaux region itself is situated), and more or less to the west of the Midi-Pyrénées region. Thus, South West France covers both the upstream areas around the rivers Dordogne and Garonne (which also flow through Bordeaux where they combine to form the Gironde estuary) and their tributaries, as well as the wine-producing areas of Gascony including Béarn, and the Northern Basque Country. However, only areas closer to the Atlantic than to the Mediterranean are included in the region, with the city of Toulouse being situated roughly halfway between the South West wine region and the Languedoc-Roussillon wine region on the Mediterranean. The brandy-producing region Armagnac is situated within Gascony and the wine region of South West France, and some of its grapes are used to make Vin de Pays under the designation Vin de Pays de Côtes de Gascogne or mixed with Armagnac to produce the mistelle Floc de Gascogne. South West France is a rather heterogeneous region in terms of its wines and how they are marketed. It is rare to see wines being sold as Vins du Sud-Ouest. Rather, the smaller areas and individual appellations market their wines under their own (smaller) umbrella, in contrast with common practice in e.g. the Bordeaux region. The areas closest to Bordeaux produce wines in a style similar to those of Bordeaux, and largely from the same grape varieties. Further south, wines are still rather similar to those of Bordeaux, but several grape varieties not used in Bordeaux are common, such as Tannat. Finally, in the areas closest to the Pyrenees, wines are made from local varieties, such as Gros Manseng and Petit Manseng."
"Crozes-Hermitage is a French wine Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) in the northern Rhône wine region of France. The appellation is the largest in the northern Rhone, and its wines are less highly regarded than those from the nearby appellations of Côte-Rôtie or its near-namesake Hermitage. Most of the wines produced here are red wines made from the Syrah grape, sometimes blended with small quantities of white Roussanne or Marsanne grapes. Some white wines are also made, based on Marsanne and/or Roussanne."
"Gigondas (French pronunciation: ​[ʒiɡɔ̃das]) is a French wine Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) in the southern Rhône wine region of France. It is primarily a red wine region, with a very small amount of rosé wine produced. No white wines carry the Gigondas appellation. Considered a little brother to Châteauneuf-du-Pape, the wine is moderately prestigious and can age well when treated with care. Gigondas AOC wine is produced exclusively in the commune of Gigondas, in Vaucluse."
"Haut-Médoc (French: [o medɔk]) is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) for wine in the Bordeaux wine region of southwestern France, on the Left Bank of the Gironde estuary. Covering a large part of the viticultural strip of land along the Médoc peninsula, the zone covers approximately 60 kilometres (37 mi) of its length. As defined by the original Institut National des Appellations d'Origine (INAO) decree of November 14, 1936, its southern edge borders the city of Bordeaux and the Médoc AOC to the north, encompassing fifteen communes exclusive to the appellation, while at the same time it enclaves six appellations made up of nine communes (Saint-Estèphe AOC, Pauillac AOC, Saint-Julien AOC, , and Margaux AOC) that are technically wine-making communes of Haut-Médoc. Similarly, Haut-Médoc is a sub-appellation of the Médoc AOC. Of Haut-Médoc's fifteen wine-producing communes, eight are located along the waterfront of Garonne and Gironde: Blanquefort, Parempuyre, Ludon, Macau, Arcins, Lamarque, Cussac and Saint-Seurin-de-Cadourne. Seven communes lie inland: Le Taillan, Le Pian-Médoc, Avensan, Saint-Laurent-Médoc. Saint-Sauveur, Cissac and Vertheuil. Few of the estates falling within the generic Haut-Médoc appellation were included in the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855 (as all but six of the 61 are located within the AOCs Margaux, Saint-Julien, Pauillac and Saint-Estèphe), but several were included in the classification Cru Bourgeois."
"Touraine-Amboise is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) for in the Loire Valley wine region in France. It is situated within the wider Touraine AOC wine appellation. It is produced by ten communes bordering both sides of the River Loire. To their west lies the town of Amboise with its famous royal château. Since its separation from the Touraine AOC in 1954, it has constituted an AOC in its own right. Annual production stands at 9,000 hectolitres of wine, spread between red, rosé, and still white wines. Effervescent wines are also produced within this AOC's boundaries, but they are not entitled to use the Touraine-Amboise appellation, belonging instead to the Touraine appellation."
"Sancerre is a French wine Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) for wine produced in the area of Sancerre in the eastern part of the Loire valley, southeast of Orléans. Almost all of the appellation lies on the left bank of the Loire, opposite Pouilly-Fumé. It is well regarded for and primarily associated with Sauvignon blanc. Some Pinot noir is also grown, accounting for around 20% of the region's production, making mostly light red wines under the designation of Sancerre Rouge. A rosé style from Pinot noir is also produced in a style similar to Beaujolais, which is produced from the Gamay grape. White Sancerre was one of the original AOCs awarded in 1936, with the same area being designated for red wines on 23 January 1959. The AOC area has expanded fourfold over the years, most recently on 18 March 1998. The town lies on an outcrop of the chalk that runs from the White Cliffs of Dover down through the Champagne and Chablis. A series of small valleys cut through the chalk, each with their own soils and microclimate and terroir. In the east are the ""flints"" that make minerally, long-lived wines. Between the town and Verdigny the soil consists of marl and gravel – ""les caillottes"" – producing fruity, well balanced wines. And in the southwest, away from the river towards Menetou-Salon, the chalky ""terres blanches"" (white ground) produce weightier wines. Most – but not all – of the Sauvignon Blancs are unoaked."
Jasnières is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) for white wine from the Loire Valley region of France.
"Coteaux de Pierrevert is a wine-growing AOC in the western part of the Provence wine region of France, where the wines are produced in 11 communes of the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence département. It is partly located in the valley of the Durance river in the region of Manosque which is the northern part of Provence, it is considered by the INAO however, to be an eastern extremity of the southern Rhône Valley."
"The Grignan-Les Adhemar AOC (formerly the Côteaux du Tricastin) is the northernmost wine-growing AOC in the southern area of the Rhône wine region of France. The wines are produced in 21 communes in the department of Drôme on the east bank of the Rhône River in a triangle bounded by Saint-Paul-Trois-Châteaux, Montélimar, and Grignan; opposite the Côtes du Vivarais AOC on the right bank. the vineyards straddle both the true Mediterranean and the continental climatic regions where in this part of France the transition is rapid, winter snow being frequent in Montélimar but rare some 20 - 30 kilometres further south. In this transitional area between the northern and southern Rhône wine regions that constitutes the northern limit of the Provence, the climate in Baume-le-Transit and St Paul are more typically Mediterranean climate than the slightly cooler areas dominated by the . According to archeological finds, particularly the remains of the largest Roman wine villa in Donzère dating from the 1st century BC, wine has been produced in the region since the antiquity. Tricastin wines were mentioned in the writings of the Marquise de Sevigné in the 16th century. The wines were accorded an AOVDQS on 19 March 1964, and were awarded their AOC on 27 July 1973."
"Côtes du Vivarais is a wine-growing AOC in the northwestern extreme of the southern Rhône wine region of France. The wines are produced in 9 communes of the Ardèche department, and in 5 communes of the department of the Gard. The region is bisected by the deep Gorges of the Ardèche and is shares the same latitudes as the Coteaux de Tricastin AOC on the left bank of the Rhône. The wine became a VDQS in 1962 and was awarded the Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée in 1999."
"Saint-Joseph or St.-Joseph is a French wine Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) in the northern Rhône wine region of France. Though the appellation covers the largest amount of land, it is second in actual size under vine to Crozes-Hermitage, an appellation with which it shares much regarding style and prestige. St.-Joseph is primarily a red wine region, but also produces a white wine. The red is produced predominantly from the Syrah grape, but AOC regulations allow up to 10% of Marsanne or Roussanne. The white wine is made exclusively from the latter grape varieties."
"Côte-Rôtie is a French wine Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) in the northern Rhône wine region of France. The vineyards are located just south of Vienne in the communes of Saint-Cyr-sur-le-Rhône, Ampuis, and Tupin-et-Semons. The vineyards are unique because of the steep slopes facing the river and their stone walls. Côte-Rôtie can be rendered in English as ""the roasted slope"" and refers to the long hours of sunlight that these steep slopes receive. The wines are red, made with Syrah grapes and up to 20% Viognier, a white grape used for its aroma. According to appellation rules, Syrah and Viognier must be fermented at the same time, a process known as cofermentation. Because of this combination, Côte-Rôtie wine typically exhibits an almost paradoxical pairing of meat aromas (including bacon) and floral aromas."
"Costières de Nîmes is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) for wines that are produced in an area between the ancient city of Nîmes and the western Rhône delta, in the French department of the Gard. Formerly part of the Languedoc region of France, as the wines more resemble those of the Rhône valley in character than of the Languedoc, it is now part of the Rhone wine area and administered by the Rhône Wine committee which has its headquarters in Avignon."
"Côtes de Duras is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) for red and white wines in South West France. Côtes de Duras is located in the department of Lot-et-Garonne, and is located immediately adjacent to the Bordeaux wine region, which is restricted to the Gironde department, as an extension of Bordeaux immediately to the east of the departmental border."
Marcillac is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée for wine in South West France and is located 20 km to the north-west of Rodez in the Aveyron department. It is located close to the Lot river which flows into Garonne.
"Rivesaltes (/ˈriːvˈsɔːlt/; French pronunciation: [ʁivzalt]) is an appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) for naturally sweet, fortified wines (vin doux naturel or VDN). The name refers to both a production region within Languedoc-Roussillon in southern France, and the style of sweet wines produced there. The Rivesaltes AOC designation of origin has been protected by INAO since 1972, combining several smaller protected designations created in 1936."
"Vouvray is a French wine region in the Loire Valley located in the Touraine district just east of the city of Tours in the commune of Vouvray. The Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) is dedicated almost exclusively to Chenin blanc; the obscure and minor grape Arbois is permitted but rarely used. Wine production in this area is highly variable and dependent on climate conditions. Cooler years promote the production of dry (sec) and sparkling Vouvray, while a warmer, more favorable vintage encourages the production of sweet moelleux or liquoreux styles produced by noble rot in a manner similar to the sweet dessert wines of Sauternes. With the naturally high acidity of Chenin blanc, Vouvrays from favorable vintages have immense aging potential. A few wines drink well into 100 years of age, but it is more common to find a well aged Vouvray peaking at the 40 year mark. Across the Loire River from Vouvray is the Montlouis AOC, which produces Chenin blanc-based wines like Vouvray that tend to have less acidity and concentration of flavor."
"Jurançon is a wine region in South West France in the foothills of the Pyrenees, around the commune of Jurançon. It produces a dry white wine and a more sought after sweet white wine. The grape varieties used are Gros Manseng, Petit Manseng and Courbu. The sweet wines develop aromas of tropical fruit such as pineapple and mango. The vines are grown on steep mountain slopes and for the sweet wines the grapes are often hand selected well into October and November to ensure the best noble rot characteristics - although Tim Wildman MW states that noble rot is not the origin of sweetness in these wines."
"Cheverny is a French wine region in the Loire Valley that makes dry white wines, light red wines and rosé wines. The area received AOVDQS (Appellation d'Origine Vin Délimité de Qualité Supérieure) status in 1973, and then AOC (Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée) on 26 March 1993 when new regulatory laws were passed. The wine region is spread over 532 hectares, within 24 communes of the Loir-et-Cher department. The white wines are composed of Sauvignon blanc grapes, at a proportion of 60%–80%, blended with Arbois, Chardonnay or Pineau Blanc de la Loire grapes. A small proportion is made into sparkling wine. The red wines are composed of Gamay grapes, at a proportion of 40%–65%, blended with Pinot noir grapes. Cabernet Franc and Côt can be used to make up to 15% of the wine. Pineau d'Aunis is added to these grape varieties when making rosés."
"Côtes de Gascogne is a wine-growing district in Gascony producing principally white wine. It is mainly located in the département of the Gers in the former Midi-Pyrénées region (now part of the Occitanie region), and it belongs to the wine region South West France. The designation Côtes de Gascogne is used for a Vin de Pays (""country wine"") produced in the Armagnac area. The decree of 13 September 1968 created the difference between a Vin de Pays and simpler table wine, the so-called Vin de table. The designation Côtes de Gascogne obliges the producers to respect the stricter rules and production standards, which were adopted with the decree of 25 January 1982."
"Saumur is a French wine region located in the Loire Valley. The region is noted for sparkling wines produced by the traditional method, and for red wines made primarily from Cabernet Franc. The main variety in the white wines is Chenin blanc. The annual Grandes Tablées du Saumur-Champigny is a popular annual event held in early August with over 1 km of tables set up in Saumur so people can sample the local foods and wine."
"The Côte de Nuits (French pronunciation: ​[kot.də.nɥi]) is a French wine region located in the northern part of the Côte d'Or, the limestone ridge that is at the heart of the Burgundy wine region. It extends from Dijon to just south of Nuits-Saint-Georges, which gives its name to the district and is the regional center. Though some white and rosé wines are produced in the region, the Côte de Nuits is most famous for reds made from pinot noir. The Côte de Nuits covers fourteen communes. Six produce grand cru wines, in the central district between Gevrey-Chambertin and Nuits-Saint-Georges, with four lesser villages either side. The Grand Crus of the Cote de Nuits are some of the smallest appellations in France, less than a hectare in the case of La Romanée. Among the northern villages of the Côte de Nuits there are several distinct terroir. Uniquely in Burgundy, Marsannay-la-Côte produces wine of all three colors - red and rosé from Pinot Noir, white from Chardonnay. The 529 acres (214 ha) of the Marsannay appellation extends into Couchey and Chênove. The village of Fixin has its own appellation, but the area of Brochon Côte de Nuits Villages extends into the commune with 55 acres (22 ha) of premier cru vineyards out of 193 acres (78 ha) of Pinot Noir and 3 acres (1.2 ha) of Chardonnay. The village of Gevrey-Chambertin has more Grand Crus than any other village, with nine. Chambertin and its extension Chambertin-Clos de Beze are widely recognized for the quality of their red Burgundy. The other Grand Crus are Mazis-Chambertin, Chapelle-Chambertin, Charmes-Chambertin, Mazoyeres-Chambertin, Griotte-Chambertin, Latricieres-Chambertin and Ruchottes-Chambertin. Morey-Saint-Denis is a small commune with four Grand Crus: Clos de la Roche, Clos St. Denis, Clos des Lambrays and Clos de Tart. Also among the northern villages, the vineyard soils of Chambolle are particularly chalky, giving the wines a lighter body and finer edge of aromas that complements the usual Côte de Nuits backbone of flavor notes. A little white wine is also made in this area. Wines labelled with Chambolle Premier Cru are usually a blend of some of the 19 individual vineyard Premier Crus, of which only Les Amoureuses and Les Charmes are commonly seen. The Grand Crus are Bonnes Mares (which spills over into Morey-Saint-Denis) and Musigny. The village of Vougeot has just one Grand Cru vineyard - Clos Vougeot - that is massive by Burgundy standards, and produces three times as much wine as the rest of the commune. But the variation in terroir over its 124 acres (50 ha), and the different winemaking styles of its 75+ owners, mean that wines labeled with the vineyard name Clos Vougeot show as much variation as the wines from entire communes elsewhere. The village of Flagey is best known for its Grand Crus of Grands Echézeaux and Echézeaux; its Premier Crus are sold under the label of Vosne-Romanée. Vosne contains some of the most famous names in the wine world, notably Romanée-Conti and La Tâche, two monopoles of the Domaine de la Romanée-Conti. The other Grand Crus are Richebourg, La Romanée (the smallest AOC in France, at 2 acres/0.84 hectares), Romanée-St. Vivant and La Grand Rue. Amidst the southern villages, Nuits-Saint-Georges the largest town in the region with producers often selling their wine to the north. The local wines are most of 'Villages' quality, and need longer aging in the cellar than most Burgundies of similar quality. Wines from Premeaux-Prissey are sold under the Nuits-Saint-Georges appellation and as Côte de Nuits Villages. Comblanchien gives its name to the seam of limestone in the middle of the Côte d'Or. Its wine is sold as Côte de Nuits Villages. The southernmost village of Corgoloin is also covered by the Côte de Nuits Villages appellation."
"Côte Chalonnaise is a subregion of the Burgundy wine region of France. Côte Chalonnaise lies to the south of the Côte d'Or continuing the same geology southward. It is still in the main area of Burgundy wine production but it includes no Grand cru vineyards. Like the Côte d'Or, it is at the western edge of the broad valley of the river Saône, on the rising ground overlooking the town of Chalon-sur-Saône which is about six kilometers out into the plain. To the north, across the River Dheune, lies the Côte de Beaune. To the south is the Mâconnais. The grapes of the region are predominantly Pinot noir and Chardonnay with some Aligoté and Gamay also grown in vineyards spread over a stretch of 25 kilometers long and 7 kilometers wide of undulating land in which vineyards are interspersed with orchards and other forms of farming. The wine-producing communes of the Côte Chalonnaise are, from the north: Bouzeron, the only communal AOC for Aligoté still wine; Rully, which has 23 premier cru vineyards and is known for its white wines as well as being a center for Crémant sparkling wines production; Mercurey, which with 30 premier cru vineyards is the largest volume producer of the region, its wines being nearly all red; Givry, with 17 premier cru vineyards producing mostly red wines; and Montagny, which produces only white wines in its 49 premier cru vineyards."
"Bouzeron is an appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) for white wine produced in the French communes of Bouzeron and Chassey-le-Camp in the Côte Chalonnaise subregion of Burgundy. Bouzeron wine is produced from the grape variety Aligoté, and Bouzeron AOC is therefore the only communal-level Burgundy appellation for Aligoté-based wines. Other Aligoté wines from Burgundy are restricted to the regional appellation Bourgogne Aligoté AOC, and all other white Burgundy wines from communal appellations (except Saint Bris AOC) are Chardonnay-based. However, Pinot blanc is technically allowed. The Bouzeron AOC was created in 1998, and at this time replaced the Bourgogne Aligoté de Bouzeron AOC, which had been introduced in 1979 within the Bourgogne Aligoté AOC. There are no Premier Cru vineyards in the Bouzeron AOC. The move towards an own appellation for Bouzeron and its Aligoté was spearheaded by the efforts of Aubert de Villaine, co-owner of Domaine de la Romanee-Conti. Together with his wife Pamela de Villaine he owns Domaine A & P de Villaine in Bouzeron."
"Château-Chalon is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée for wines made in the Jura wine region of France, around the village of Château-Chalon. Only white wines from the Savagnin grape made in the vin jaune (""yellow wine"") style can be made using this appellation. However, the Château-Chalon wines are not explicitly labeled as vin jaune. It is bottled in the traditional bottle called clavelin that is of a peculiar shape and with a capacity of 62 cl, which is, according to local legend, the amount left of a litre of wine after aging in cask for six years and three months - the legal minimum for Chateau Chalon. Once bottled, the wine is of great longevity, and can age for several decades."
"Fitou (Occitan: Fiton) is a large French wine appellation in Languedoc-Roussillon, France. The dominant vine variety is Carignan which has to constitute 40% of any blend. Grenache, Lladoner Pelut (the 'hairy' Grenache), Mourvèdre and Syrah are also often blended with it. Muscat de Rivesaltes AOC, a vin doux naturel, also comes from the region."
"Cabardès (French pronunciation: ​[kabaʁdɛs]) is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) for red and rosé wine in Languedoc-Roussillon wine region in France. Cabardès was named after the Lords of Cabaret who defended the Châteaux de Lastours against Simon de Montfort in 1209. Despite the name's medieval origins, this appellation is one of the youngest in France, having only become official in February 1999."
"Corbières is an Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) for wine in the Languedoc-Roussillon, France, and it is this region's largest AOC, responsible for 46 per cent of the region's AOC wine production in 2005. Red wine dominates the production in Corbières with almost 95 per cent, with 3.5 per cent rosé wine and 2 per cent white wine making up the balance. Carignan is the most common grape variety. The AOC was created in 1985, covers 13,500 hectares (33,000 acres) of vineyards and produces an average of 554,000 hectoliters of wine per year, corresponding to 74 million bottles. Due to its size and geography, Corbières encompasses an enormous variety of soil types and microclimates. The wines from the region tend to be just as varied as the terroir. The region also experiences widely varied winds. The dry, Atlantic vent Cers frequently brings cold weather from the northwest while the area is normally under the influence of the warm, Mediterranean vent Marin."
"Faugères is an Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) in the Languedoc-Roussillon wine region in France and is named after Faugères. It is also known as Coteaux-du-Languedoc Faugères and lies 20 km northwest of Béziers, on the hills of Hérault. It is a local classification within the Coteaux-du-Languedoc AOC."
"Minervois is an AOC in the Languedoc-Roussillon wine region, in the departments of the Aude and of the Herault. Historically, the region's capital has been the village of Minerve. AOC regulations require the wine to be blended (at least 2 varieties), so pure varietal wines must be Vin de Pays. The red wines of the Minervois appellation are produced from Syrah and Mourvedre, Grenache and Lladoner Pelut (minimum 60%); and Carignan, Cinsault, Piquepoul, Terret, and Rivairenc (maximum 40%). In any case Syrah and Mourvedre needs to be at least 20% of total, and Piquepoul, Terret, and Rivairenc needs to be no more than 10%. The white wines, which are less commonly found, may include Marsanne, Roussanne, Maccabeu, Bourboulenc, Clairette, Grenache, Vermentino, Piquepoul and Muscat Blanc a Petits Grains."
"Palette is a small French wine AOC in the Provence region of southern France, near Aix-en-Provence. The AOC was established in 1948. The grapes for this AOC are grown in Aix-en-Provence, Meyreuil, and Le Tholonet. The hamlet of Palette, which gives its name to the AOC, is located on the territory of the commune of Le Tholonet."
"Coteaux du Lyonnais is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) for wine in central-southeastern France. This wine-growing area is located on the slopes of the Monts du Lyonnais, a mountain range to the west of Lyon and in the eastern part of Massif Central."

"Béarn is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) for wine in South West France. It is located in the area of intersection of three French departments: Pyrénées-Atlantiques, Hautes-Pyrénées and Gers; and two regions: Aquitaine and Midi-Pyrénées. Some vineyards in the area of the Jurançon AOC can also produce red Béarn wine, and some in the area of the Madiran AOC may produce a rosé Béarn. Wines made in the village of Bellocq also carry the appellation Béarn-Bellocq."
"Gaillac AOC is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) in South West France in the département of Tarn, just north of Toulouse."
"Côtes du Marmandais is an Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) for wine located in South West France around the commune of Marmande. With its location just southeast of the Entre-Deux-Mers along the banks of the Garonne river, it is a satellite of Bordeaux, but just outside the borders of that region. The region was elevated from Vin Délimité de Qualité Superieure (VDQS) to AOC status in 1990. From the Middle Ages to the 19th century, the wines of the Côtes du Marmandais were widely exported to the Netherlands. The Phylloxera epidemic wiped out most of the vineyards in this area with many farmers switching to other agricultural crops. It was not until the later half of the 20th century that viticulture in the area reaffirmed itself."
"Buzet is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) for wine in South West France, in the department of Lot-et-Garonne."
"Monbazillac is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) for sweet white wine produced in the village of Monbazillac on the left bank of the Dordogne River just across from the town of Bergerac in South West France. The appellation covers almost 2,000 hectares (4,900 acres) of vineyards."
"Saint-Pourçain is an Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) for wine located around Saint-Pourçain-sur-Sioule in the Auvergne region of France. It can alternatively be considered as an upstream satellite of the Loire wine region or as a tiny wine region in its own right. White, rosé and red wines are produced on vineyards covering 600 hectares (1,500 acres) in 19 communes of Auvergne."
"Pouilly-Fumé is an appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) for the dry sauvignon blanc white wine produced around Pouilly-sur-Loire, in the Nièvre département. Another white wine produced in the same area but with a different grape variety is called Pouilly-sur-Loire."
"Coteaux du Layon is an Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) for sweet white wine in the Loire Valley wine region of France. Coteaux du Layon is situated in the Anjou district of the region, along the river Layon, which is a tributary of the Loire River. Six of the villages (communes), namely Beaulieu-sur-Layon, Faye-d'Anjou, Rablay-sur-Layon, Rochefort-sur-Loire, Saint-Aubin-de-Luigné and Saint-Lambert-du-Lattay are allowed to add their name to that of the appellation. Usually, the ""de"" or ""sur"" part is dropped, to give names like Coteaux du Layon Beaulieu and Coteaux du Layon Saint-Aubin. Furthermore, two villages within the Coteaux du Layon area form their own respective AOC – Bonnezeaux and Chaume. Finally, a favoured enclave within Chaume is a separate AOC under the name Quarts de Chaume. For the geographically delimited AOCs, required grape maturity is higher and allowed yield is lower. The best vineyards are generally located on the north bank of the Layon, where they enjoy a good sun exposure on roughly south-facing slopes. Coteaux du Layon including its enclave appellations cover about 1,400 hectares (3,500 acres) in the early 2000s. The wines of Coteaux du Layon are all made from Chenin blanc, locally often called Pineau de la Loire. Often, the grapes are harvested when they are affected by noble rot, but can also be very ripe or have sun-dried on the vine, so-called passerillé grapes. While Coteaux du Layon wines are never dry, the level of sweetness varies. Simpler wines from the basic appellation could best be described as semi-sweet, while some producers – nicknamed ""sugar hunters"" – produce very sweet wines with an intense botrytis character similar to a Trockenbeerenauslese. Some, but not all of these very sweet wines are labelled Sélection de Grains Nobles. However, it has been claimed that since the late 1990s, fewer producers try to get the sweetness of their wines up to the very extreme levels sought by many ""sugar hunters"" during the 1990s."
"Bordeaux wine (Occitan: vin de Bordèu, French: vin de Bordeaux) is produced in the Bordeaux region of southwest France, around the city of Bordeaux, on the Garonne River. To the north of the city the Dordogne River joins the Garonne forming the broad estuary called the Gironde; the Gironde department, with a total vineyard area of over 120,000 hectares, is the largest wine growing area in France. Average vintages produce over 700 million bottles of wine, ranging from large quantities of everyday table wine, to some of the most expensive and prestigious wines in the world. The vast majority of wine produced in Bordeaux is red (sometimes called ""claret"" in Britain), with sweet white wines (most notably Sauternes), dry whites, and (in much smaller quantities) rosé and sparkling wines (Crémant de Bordeaux) collectively making up the remainder. Bordeaux wine is made by more than 8,500 producers or châteaux. There are 54 appellations of Bordeaux wine."
"The Côte de Beaune area is the southern part of the Côte d'Or, the limestone ridge that is home to the great names of Burgundy wine. The Côte de Beaune starts between Nuits-Saint-Georges and Beaune, and extends southwards for about 25 km to the River Dheune. The trend of producing red wines continues from the Côte de Nuits to the north, down through Beaune, although the wines become lighter and more perfumed. Farther south lie the great names of white Burgundy such as Meursault and Chassagne-Montrachet. The far south of the district sees a return to red wines in Santenay that continues across the Dheune into the Côte Chalonnaise. This mix of Pinot noir and Chardonnay grapes reflects geology in the southern Côte d'Or that is more variable than in the north."
"Maury is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) for fortified vin doux naturel wines made in the Roussillon wine region of France. Almost all wines are red, made from at least 75% Grenache noir (Garnacha). Other permitted grapes are Grenache blanc, Grenache gris, Macabeu (Macabeo), Malvoisie du Roussillon (Tourbat), Syrah, Muscat and other local varieties. Although the grapes are different, they are used and marketed very much like port. It is made in the communes of Maury, Saint-Paul-de-Fenouillet, Lesquerde, Tautavel and Rasiguères. The AOC was granted in 1936. Maury is a ""vin doux naturel"" style created by adding fortifying spirits, such as brandy, to the wine in mid-fermentation. This halts the activities of the wine yeast leaving the wine with ""natural"" residual sugars. Maury is vinified in a manner similar to port, but initial aging is often conducted in large 25 liter (6.6 US gallon/5.5 imperial gallon) glass jugs known as bonbonnes, les dames jeannes or demi-johns. The wines may also be aged in wood for up to 15 years. The resulting wines vary in depth and concentration. In food and wine pairings, Maury is often served as an apéritif or as an accompaniment to foie gras, duck and strong blue cheeses. For dessert, aged Maury, much like Banyuls, is recognized as a suitable pairing for chocolate."
"Côtes du Roussillon is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée for wines made in the Roussillon wine region of France. It is the least selective AOC in the Roussillon region. In 2002, 21,048,500 litres of Côtes du Roussillon were produced, 68% red, 28% rosé and 4% white. Grenache is the dominant variety in Red and Rosé. According to the AOC rules, however, red wines must be made with at least three varieties of grapes. The total of the two main variety grapes should not make more than 90% of the blend, and there must not be more than 60% of Carignan in it."
"Saussignac is a wine appellation (Appellation d'origine contrôlée, AOC) in South West France. The Saussignac AOC is used exclusively for a sweet white dessert wine, similar to Monbazillac but a little drier. The grapes used are generally Sémillon grapes which have been affected by Botrytis cinerea. To qualify for the appellation, the grapes must be grown, and the wine produced, in the four communes of Saussignac, Razac-de-Saussignac, Monestier and Gageac-et-Rouillac. A fundamental difference between Saussignac and all other sweet or late-harvest wines is that chaptalization, or the addition of sugar, is forbidden under the rules of the AOC."
"Piesporter is a wine made in and around the village of Piesport on the north bank of the Mosel wine region of Germany. A white, light body wine that ranges from dry to off-dry, it can be made from Riesling, Müller-Thurgau, or Elbling grapes. The wine often has a Qualitätswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete (QbA) classification, meaning that it was produced in accordance with regional appellation laws and has been tested for compliance by an official committee. In some cases a Piesporter may be chaptalized with sugar added to the juice before fermentation to increase the alcohol level. Chaptalization is more common in the “cheap” export Piesporters that are made from the Müller-Thurgau and Elbling varieties. The cheaper wines are often labelled as ""Piesporter Michelsberg""—which means that the grapes are from somewhere in the area, as opposed to the first-class vineyards in Piesport itself (""Piesporter Goldtröpfchen"" being the most famous one). Despite the poor reputation that Piesporters get from the inferior varieties that often flood the market, Piesporter wine and the village from which they originate have a long and unique history in producing outstanding German wine."
"Palatinate (German: Pfalz) is a German wine-growing region (Weinbaugebiet) in the area of Bad Dürkheim, Neustadt an der Weinstraße, and Landau in Rhineland-Palatinate. Before 1993, it was known as Rhine Palatinate (Rheinpfalz). With 23,461 hectares (57,970 acres) under cultivation in 2008, the region is the second largest wine region in Germany after Rheinhessen. There are about 6,800 vintners producing around 6.5 million hectolitres of wine annually."
"Niederlausitz (Lower Lusatia) is a small region for table wine and country wine in eastern Germany, which was defined in an amendment to the German wine law in 2007. It is located in Brandenburg, which is the federal state surrounding Berlin. The designation Brandenburger Landwein is used for country wines from this region. Lower Lusatia is not part of the 13 well-established German wine regions for quality wine (usually referred to as Anbaugebiete), and is located to the north of all of them, but south of Stargarder Land, which was defined in 2004. This means that Lower Lusatian wineries are not allowed to produce wine of all quality levels of the German wine classification. Only the lower part - Tafelwein (table wine) and Landwein (country wine) - and not the higher ""quality wine"" categories Qualitätswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete (QbA) and Prädikatswein may be produced. Currently, the Niederlausitz region covers only 11 hectares (27 acres) of vineyards spread out over 14 locations. A peculiar aspect of the Niederlausitz region is that some of the vineyards are planted in former coal strip mines."
"Saxony (Sachsen) is a region for quality wine in Germany located in the German federal state of Saxony. The region is sometimes referred to colloquially as the Elbtal (Elbe valley). The wine region covers 462 hectares (1,140 acres), which makes it Germany's third smallest region, just ahead of Mittelrhein and Hessische Bergstraße in size. It is situated along the Elbe river from the Pillnitz section of Dresden to the village of located north of Meissen. Together with the Saale-Unstrut wine region, Saxony is one of the northernmost wine regions in Europe and are the only two of Germany's 13 wine regions that are located in the former East Germany. After German reunification in 1990, the vineyard surface was expanded from 200 to 450 hectares with European Union subsidies, but in recent years the vineyard area has decreased."
"Ruwer or Ruwerthal is a wine-growing district (Bereich) at the Ruwer (river) near Trier, Germany. It is a district of the Mosel region, which used to be called Mosel-Saar-Ruwer. The Romans produced wine in the Ruwer region since the 2nd century."
"Nahe is a region (Anbaugebiet) for quality wine in Germany, along the River Nahe in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. On the region's 4,155 hectares (10,270 acres) of vineyards in 2008, white wine grapes dominate with 75% and Riesling is the most common variety with 27.2%. A characteristic of the Nahe region is that the soils are very varied owing to the region's volcanic origins. Although the region was populated already in Roman times, and the village of Monzingen was mentioned as a wine village as early as 778, the Nahe wine region was defined only with the 1971 German wine law. Before that, the wines were sold as plain ""Rhine wine"". In recent decades, several Nahe producers have made a name for themselves with Riesling wines that have been rated very highly by international wine critics, and have come to be seen as being on par with the best wines of Moselle and Rheingau wines."
"Rheingau is one of 13 designated German wine regions (Weinbaugebiete) producing quality wines (QbA and Prädikatswein). It was named after the traditional region of Rheingau (meaning ""Rhine district""), the wine region is situated in the state of Hesse, where it constitutes part of the Rheingau-Taunus-Kreis administrative district. Although, making up only 3 percent of the total German vineyard area, Rheingau has been the source of many historically important innovations in German wine making, and contains many wine producers of international reputation, such as Schloss Johannisberg. Rheingau, with 3,125 hectares (7,720 acres) of vineyards in 2016, also boasts a higher proportion of Riesling (78.3%) than any other German wine-growing region, with Spätburgunder (Pinot noir) making up most of the rest (12.3%), followed by Müller-Thurgau."
"Württemberg is a region (Anbaugebiet) for quality wine in Germany, and is located in the historical region of Württemberg in southwestern Germany, which today forms part of the federal state of Baden-Württemberg. Under German wine legislation, Württemberg and Baden are separate wine regions. With 11,511 hectares (28,440 acres) under vine in 2008, Württemberg is Germany's fourth largest wine region. Winemaking cooperatives are very common in Württemberg, number around 70, and are responsible for almost 75% of the region's production. Unlike most other German regions, Württemberg has a long history of producing red wines, although from somewhat different varieties than other German wine regions."
"Baden is a region (Anbaugebiet) for quality wine in Germany, and is located in the historical region of Baden in southwestern Germany, which today forms part of the federal state of Baden-Württemberg. Under German wine legislation, Baden and Württemberg are separate wine regions. With 15,906 hectares (39,300 acres) under vine in 2008, Baden is Germany's third largest wine region, but seems to be much less known on export markets in comparison to many smaller German regions, and in comparison to the neighbouring French region of Alsace, which is of similar size. Winemaking cooperatives are very common in Baden, number around 100, and are responsible for 85% of the region's production."
"The Hessische Bergstraße (""Hessian Mountain Road"") is a defined region (Anbaugebiet) for wine in Germany located in the state of Hesse among the northern and western slopes of the Odenwald mountain chain. With only 467 hectares (1,150 acres) of vineyards it is the smallest of the 13 German quality wine regions. At 21% red grape varieties and 79% white varieties, it is planted with primarily Riesling (41% as of 2018), Pinot gris (11%) and Spätburgunder (Pinot Noir, 11%). Hessische Bergstraße is divided into two districts (Bereiche) - Umstadt and Starkenburg - three collective vineyard sites and 24 individual vineyard sites. The region produces mostly dry wines but does have a sizable production of Eiswein. The wines from the best producers are in a style similar to that of Rheingau. The majority of the region's wine is produced by a winemaking cooperative based in the city of Heppenheim, to which about 620 of 850 growers of the region deliver their grapes. The state government of Hesse, through the Hessian State Wineries (Hessische Staatsweingüter) is the biggest single vineyard owner with 38 hectares (94 acres) since 2008 processed in the central cellar of the state wineries at the Steinberg, Kloster Eberbach, site. Because of the small production and a location rather close to densely populated areas, most of the wines is sold locally, and it is very uncommon to see Bergstraße wines outside of Germany."
"The Siebengebirge wine growing district (""Bereich"") is part of the Mittelrhein wine growing region and is made up entirely of the Petersberg site (""Großlage""). The district is named for the Siebengebirge mountain range, located within the municipal boundaries of Bad Honnef and Königswinter. The acreage under cultivation once exceeded 500 hectares, of which today only about 20 hectares remain."
"Goumenissa (Greek: Γουμένισσα [ɣuˈme̞nisa]) is a small traditional town in the Kilkis regional unit, Central Macedonia, Greece. It was the capital of the former Paionia Province.

Goumenissa has narrow streets lined with traditional houses and is renowned for a wide range of things; apart from its preindustrial monuments built beside lush springs, there are traditional wineries which prove the expertise of this small country town to produce good quality wine. It is known for its folklore museum, its impromptu brass bands (Τα Χάλκινα της Γουμένισσας Ta Chalkina tis Goumenissas) and its customs, events and fetes, all of them are reflective of the traditional lifestyle."
"Santorini is a Greek wine region located on the archipelago of Santorini in the southern Cyclades islands of Greece. Wine has been produced there since ancient times, but it was during the Middle Ages that the wine of Santorini became famous worldwide under the influence of the Republic of Venice. The Italian influence is still present in modern Santorini winemaking: the most famous Tuscan sweet wine is called Vin Santo just like Santorini's Vinsanto/Visanto (labeled such to differentiate it from the Tuscan wine). It is made in a passito style from grapes dried in the sun after harvest. Santorini also produces blended and rosé wine made from white grapes such as Athiri, Aidini and Assyrtiko, and red grapes such as Mandelaria."

Sovana received DOC status in 1999, along with its neighbor, the DOC Capalbio. Sovana encompasses roughly the same areas that produce the white wine Bianco di Pitigliano, and encompasses the towns of Pitigliano, Sorano, Manciano and borders the DOC Morellino di Scansano in the north, and the region of Lazio in the south. Under the DOC regulations, Sovana can be made in rosso or rosato styles. Sovana rosso must be at least 50% sangiovese, plus up to 50% other local non aromatic red grapes. One of these local grapes used for the Sovana blend is Ciliegiolo. Sovana rosso is for the most part a light wine, although there are reserva wines that receive extended maturation. Sovana also allows monovarietal DOC wines, made from the grapes of Aleatico, Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot. These wines must contain at least 85% of the varietal in order to allow it to be stated on the bottle #e.g., Sovana Merlot DOC#. Up to 15% of other authorized grapes may be used in the blend."
"Parrina is a small Italian Denominazione di Origine Controllata comprising parts of the commune of Orbetello in the province of Grosseto, Tuscany. The DOC was awarded in 1971, and extends to 110.33 hectares (272.6 acres) with about 20 wine producers, the largest of which, by far, is Antica Fattoria . The DOC originally allowed only the use of Italian varieties such as Trebbiano, Sangiovese and Ansonica, but an amendment in 1986 recognised emerging trends in allowing the use of Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. About 50% of the wine production is white, 35% red, and 15% rosato (rosé, or pink). The name ""Parrina"" may originate from the Castilian word for a pergola on which vines or figs are grown. Others argue the area took its name from the Parrini order which had a monastery here in the twelfth century (although the existence of such an order is hard to substantiate). The small Parrina DOC is located entirely within the larger Ansonica Costa dell'Argentario DOC."
"Rosso Barletta is a red Italian wine produced in the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) region of Barletta, located in the province of Barletta-Andria-Trani of north-central Apulia. The DOC is permitted to produce red wine only, made primarily from Uva di Troia, and is one of the few wine regions in Italy where Malbec is grown and permitted in a DOC wine. The DOC covers over 60 hectares (150 acres) that are planted to Uva di Troia, Montepulciano, Sangiovese, and Malbec. Rosso Barletta is noted in history for being the spark for a jousting skirmish, now known as the Challenge of Barletta, involving thirteen local Italian knights against thirteen French knights, following an evening of drinking too much Barletta wine. According to the Italian Trade Commission, when the wine region was officially recognised it retained the name Rosso Barletta in commemoration of the historic connection between the region's wine and the event."
"Calabrian wine (Italian: Vino Calabrese) is Italian wine from the Calabria region of southern Italy. Over 90% of the region's wine production is red wine, with a large portion made from the Gaglioppo grape. Calabria has 12 Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) regions, but only 4% of the yearly production is classified as DOC wine. The region is one of Italy's most rural and least industrialized with per capita income less than half of the national average. Following World War II, many of Calabria's inhabitants emigrated to Northern Italy, the United States, Australia and Argentina. Those left behind have been slow to develop a vibrant wine industry with only the red wines of Cirò garnering much international attention. Today Calabrian wines are mostly produced to high alcohol levels and sold to co-operatives who transfer the wines to the northern Italian wine regions to use as blending component. There are no Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) regions, but Calabria does have 12 Indicazione Geografica Tipica (IGT) designations."
"Lombardia (Lombardy) wine is the Italian wine produced in the Lombardy region of north central Italy.

"Morellino di Scansano DOCG is an Italian red wine made in the hilly environs of the village of Scansano, GR, in the Maremma region of coastal Tuscany, which has an ancient but obscure tradition of winemaking. Morellino is the local name for the Sangiovese grape variety. Many people think that the name Morellino comes from morello (brown), the colour of the region's horses. The name may also come from the morello cherry, a dark red cherry with great tartness and acidity. The wine, which was granted DOC status in 1978, then upgraded to DOCG status beginning with the 2007 vintage, is made from at least 85% Sangiovese, which is also the basis of the Tuscan wines Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino, and Vino Nobile di Montepulciano. The remaining 15% can comprise any non-aromatic black grape varieties included in a list made and periodically updated by Tuscan wine authorities."

"Frascati is an Italian white wine named after the town of Frascati, located 25 km southeast of Rome, in Lazio, Italy. Archeological discoveries from the ancient town of Tusculum, now Frascati, demonstrate the cultivation of grapes for wine since the 5th century BC. It was one of the preferred wines of Ancient Rome, Renaissance Popes, poets and artists visiting in the Grand Tour 1700s and 1800s, and of the La Dolce Vita generation in the 1960s. Made from Malvasia di Candia, Malvasia del Lazio, Grechetto, Bombino bianco, and Trebbiano grapes, Frascati gained Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) status in 1966 and DOCG status in 2011, making it one of Italy's first DOC wines. The Frascati DOC/DOCG area is located in the heart of the Castelli Romani, Tusculum and Albani Hills south of Rome, and north of Lake Albano. The vineyards range from 200 to 1,000 feet in altitude. The soils are well drained and volcanic. The DOC allows for a minimum of 70% Malvasia (Bianca di Candia) and/or Malvasia del Lazio (aka Bombino) and a 30% maximum of Trebbiano and/or Greco and a maximum of 10% other white grapes. Many of the vineyards' cellars have ancient Roman caves. Modern cellars and techniques are now leading the way to an ever growing reputation of a fine quality wine, with many award winning labels. Frascati wine is also an ingredient in the Frascati Frizz aperitif. Two Frascati wines qualified on Sep 20th 2011 for the higher DOCG recognition:

Along with the Veneto and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, the Friuli-Venezia Giulia forms the Tre Venezie wine region which ranks with Tuscany and Piedmont as Italy's world class wine regions."
"Tuscan wine (Italian Toscana) is Italian wine from the Tuscany region. Located in central Italy along the Tyrrhenian coast, Tuscany is home to some of the world's most notable wine regions. Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino and Vino Nobile di Montepulciano are primarily made with Sangiovese grape whereas the Vernaccia grape is the basis of the white Vernaccia di San Gimignano. Tuscany is also known for the dessert wine Vin Santo, made from a variety of the region's grapes. Tuscany has forty-one Denominazioni di origine controllata (DOC) and eleven Denominazioni di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG). In the 1970s a new class of wines known in the trade as ""Super Tuscans"" emerged. These wines were made outside DOC/DOCG regulations but were considered of high quality and commanded high prices. Many of these wines became cult wines. In the reformation of the Italian classification system many of the original Super Tuscans now qualify as DOC or DOCG wines (such as the new Bolgheri label) but some producers still prefer the declassified rankings or to use the Indicazione Geografica Tipica (IGT) classification of Toscana. Tuscany has six sub-categories of IGT wines today."
"Roero (Italian pronunciation: [roˈɛːro]; Piedmontese: Roé [rʊˈe]) is a geographical area in the north-east corner of the province of Cuneo in Piedmont, north-west Italy. This hilly region is known for its wines and for its fruit production: particularly the peaches of Canale and the local variety of pear known as Madernassa which originated in the late eighteenth century in Vezza d'Alba. Strawberries are also grown. The name comes from the Roero family of bankers and traders, who were prominent in the political life of Asti and its environs, and who dominated this area for a number of centuries during the Middle Ages. The designated zone of production for the DOCG wines Roero and Roero Arneis is a subset of this territory which comprises the communes of Castellinaldo, Canale, Corneliano d’Alba, Piobesi d’Alba and Vezza d’Alba, plus parts of Baldissero d'Alba, Castagnito, Guarene, Govone, Magliano Alfieri, Montà, Monteu Roero, Pocapaglia, Priocca, Santa Vittoria d'Alba, Santo Stefano Roero and Sommariva Perno."
"Chiantishire is a nickname for an area of Tuscany, Italy, where many upper-class British citizens have moved or usually spend their holidays. The word is a late 20th century neologism and derives from Chianti, a red wine produced in central Tuscany, in particular in the provinces of Siena and Florence. The location rose to prominence in the UK in the mid 1990s when then Prime Minister Tony Blair chose it as one of his preferred summer retreats. Celebrities who have owned properties in the area include Sting, Bryan Ferry, Antonio Banderas and Richard Gere. The novel, ""Summer's Lease"" by John Mortimer characterizes satirically the manners and mores of British expatriates in Chiantishire. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office estimated in 2012 that there were 28,000 Britons living in Italy."

"Abruzzo (Abruzzi) is an Italian wine region located in the mountainous central Italian region of Abruzzo along the Adriatic Sea. It is bordered by the Molise wine region to the south, Marche to the north and Lazio to the west. Abruzzo's rugged terrain, 65% of which is mountainous, help to isolate the region from the winemaking influence of the ancient Romans and Etruscans in Tuscany but the area has had a long history of wine production. Today more than 22 million cases of wine are produced annually in Abruzzo, making it the seventh most productive region in Italy, but only 21.5% of which is made under the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) designation. More than two-thirds of the region's wine is produced by co-operatives or sold in bulk to negociants in other Italian wine regions in Tuscany, Piedmont and the Veneto for blending. The most notable wine of the region is Montepulciano d'Abruzzo produced with the Montepulciano grape that is distinct from the Sangiovese grape behind the Tuscan wine Vino Nobile di Montepulciano. Together with Trebbiano d'Abruzzo, Montepulciano d'Abruzzo is one of the most widely exported DOC wine from Italy, particularly to the United States. While wine is produced in all four of Abruzzo's provinces, the bulk of the production takes place in the province of Chieti which is the fifth largest producing province in all of Italy.

"New South Wales wine is Australian wine produced in New South Wales, Australia. New South Wales is Australia's most populous state and its wine consumption far outpaces the region's wine production. The Hunter Valley, located 130 km (81 mi) north of Sydney, is the most well-known wine region but the majority of the state's production takes place in the Big Rivers zone-Perricoota, Riverina and along the Darling and Murray Rivers. The wines produced from the Big Rivers zone are largely used in box wine and mass-produced wine brands such as Yellow Tail. A large variety of grapes are grown in New South Wales, including Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Shiraz and Sémillon. New South Wales is the second-largest wine-producing state in Australia, accounting for 30 percent of the A$5 billion Australian wine industry In 1994 the various wine regions within New South Wales agreed there was a need to form a peak lobby group to act as the conduit between industry and the New South Wales Government, and to represent New South Wales at the Federal level through the Winemakers Federation of Australia Inc. This body is the New South Wales Wine Industry Association."
"The Canberra District wine region is located around Canberra in the Capital city of Australia.

"Bendigo is a settlement and historic area in Central Otago, in the southern South Island of New Zealand. It is located some 20 kilometres to the north of Cromwell, to the east of the head of Lake Dunstan, on the banks of the Bendigo Creek, a small tributary of the Clutha River. In pre-European times, the area was not widely used, though an established Māori trail ran through it. Remains of pounamu weapons have been found in the area, as has a waka paddle now in the collection of the Otago Museum, and the remains of some moa egg shells, all suggesting it may have been used as a temporary camping area. Bendigo first achieved notability in the 1860s, during the Otago Gold Rush. Gold was discovered at Bendigo Creek in 1862. The goldfield around the settlement became one of the country's richest, yielding an estimated 15 to 50 ounces of gold per week. The initial alluvial gold was rapidly played out, but quartz reefs bearing the precious metal were discovered by Thomas Logan in 1863 and many mine shafts were sunk into the rock during the 1860s. By the mid 1870s, the reef was considered Otago's (and the country's) richest. Mining continued in the area until the 1940s. The settlement's name is a relic of this time, having been transplanted from the Australian town of the same name by gold miners who had travelled from the Victorian goldfields. The remains of the gold field, which was rapidly played out, have been largely preserved, and form the basis of the 1085 hectare Bendigo Historic Reserve. The reserve contains numerous walkways and includes the remains of mineshafts, water races, stamping batteries and the remains of several now-deserted settlement buildings."

"Ontario wine is Canadian wine produced in the province of Ontario. The provinces has three official wine-growing region, the Niagara Peninsula, the north shore of Lake Erie, and Prince Edward County, although wineries also exist in other regions in Ontario. Approximately two-thirds of Canada's vineyard acreage is situated in Ontario, with over 150 vineyards spread across 6,900 hectares (17,000 acres). As a result, the province is the country's largest producer of wine, accounting for 62 per cent of Canadian wine production, and 68 per cent of all Canadian wine exports. The province is home to Canada's first commercial winery, opened on Pelee Island in 1866. Wineries based in Ontario began to produce ice wine in the early 1980s. In 1999, the Legislative Assembly of Ontario named the Vintners Quality Alliance (VQA) of Ontario as the province's official wine authority. Grape vine wines constitutes the majority of wine produced in Ontario, with the province also being the world's largest producer of ice wines, a style of grape wine. Grape wines made from 100 per cent Ontario grapes can qualify for classification under Ontario's appellation system, managed by the VQA. Grape wines that are qualified by the provincial wine authority are able to use the descriptor ""Ontario wine,"" in addition with other regulated labelling terms. However not all wines produced in Ontario are eligible for VQA certification; most notably fruit wines, and wines made from hybrid grapes."

"The South Australian wine industry is responsible for more than half the production of all Australian wine. South Australia has a vast diversity in geography and climate which allows the state to be able to produce a range of grape varieties–from the cool climate Riesling variety in the Clare Valley wine region to the big, full bodied Shiraz wines of the Barossa Valley. Some of Australia's best-known wines like Penfolds Grange, Jacob's Creek, Yalumba and Henschke Hill of Grace are produced there, as well as many of Australia's mass-produced box wines. As with most agriculture in Australia, irrigation is vital to the success of the South Australian wine industry."
"The Barossa Valley wine region is one of Australia's oldest and most premier wine regions. Located in South Australia, the Barossa Valley is about 56 km (35 miles) northeast of the city of Adelaide. Unlike most of Australia whose wine industry was heavily influenced by the British, the wine industry of the Barossa Valley was founded by German settlers fleeing persecution from the Prussian province of Silesia (in what is now Poland). The warm continental climate of the region promoted the production of very ripe grapes that was the linchpin of the early Australian fortified wine industry. As the modern Australian wine industry shifted towards red table wines (particularly those made by the prestigious Cabernet Sauvignon) in the mid-20th century, the Barossa Valley fell out of favor due to its reputation for being largely a Syrah from producers whose grapes were destined for blending. During this period the name ""Barossa Valley"" rarely appeared on wine labels. In the 1980s, the emergence of several boutique families specializing in old vine Shiraz wines began to capture international attention for the distinctive style of Barossa Shiraz, a full bodied red wine with rich chocolate and spice notes. This led to a renaissance in the Barossa Valley which catapulted the region to the forefront of the Australian wine industry. Many of Australia's largest and most notable wineries are either headquartered or own extensive holdings in the Barossa Valley. These include such wineries as Penfolds, Peter Lehmann, Orlando Wines, Seppeltsfield, Wolf Blass and Yalumba. Many Shiraz vines in the Barossa Valley are several decades old, with some vineyards planted with old vines that are 100–150 years old including Turkey Flat in Tanunda that is home to the oldest commercially producing grape vines, originally planted in 1847. Other grape varieties grown in the Barossa Valley include Grenache, Mourvedre, Cabernet Sauvignon, Riesling, Chardonnay and Semillon. In February 2011, South Australian Premier Mike Rann announced that special legislation would be introduced to protect the unique heritage of the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale. Premier Rann said: ""Barossa and McLaren Vale food and wine are key icons of South Australia. We must never allow the Barossa or McLaren Vale to become suburbs of Adelaide."" The Character Preservation (Barossa Valley) Act 2012 was subsequently passed by the South Australian Parliament."
"McLaren Vale is a wine region in the Australian state of South Australia located in the Adelaide metropolitan area and centred on the town of McLaren Vale about 38 kilometres (24 mi) south of the Adelaide city centre. It is internationally renowned for the wines it produces and included within the Great Wine Capitals of the World. The region was named after either David McLaren, the Colonial Manager of the South Australia Company or John McLaren (unrelated) who surveyed the area in 1839. Among the first settlers to the region in late 1839, were two English farmers from Devon, William Colton and Charles Thomas Hewett. William Colton established the Daringa Farm and Charles Thomas Hewett established Oxenberry Farm. Both men would be prominent in the early days of McLaren Vale. Although initially the region's main economic activity was the growing of cereal crops, John Reynell and Thomas Hardy planted grape vines in 1838 and the present-day Seaview and Hardy wineries were in operation as early as 1850. Grapes were first planted in the region in 1838 and some vines more than 100 years old are still producing. Today there are more than 88 cellar doors in McLaren Vale. The majority are small family-run operations and boutique wineries."

Wrattonbully is a region of ancient World Heritage-listed geology, which in more recent times has been chosen to establish a successful wine region due to its outstanding viticultural attributes. The first vines for winegrapes were planted in the late 1960s; however it was in the 1990s that the excellent soils and elevated sites attracted many winemakers from surrounding areas. The region now draws winemakers and the attention of wine connoisseurs from around the world. Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz are the two main varieties grown, and Wrattonbully wines of these varieties are highly regarded for their complexity and elegance. Merlot and Chardonnay are also widely grown with great success - in fact the cool climate of the Wrattonbully wine region is proving suitable for many varieties."

"Catalan wines are those that are produced in the wine region of Catalonia. Occasionally, the appellation is applied to some French wine made in the Catalan region of Roussillon also known as Northern Catalonia or the Pays catalans. The city of Barcelona is the capital of Catalonia and despite not being in a wine region (although a portion of the Penedès is in the greater comarca of Barcelona) it is the focal point of the Catalan wine industry: a primary consumer market, its port provides export functions and a source of financial resources and investment. The area has a long winemaking tradition and was the birthplace of the sparkling wine Cava, invented in the early 1870s in Sant Sadurní d'Anoia by Josep Raventos of Codorníu Winery. At the turn of the 20th century, the Catalan wine industry was at the forefront of Spain's emergence as a world leader in quality wine production, being the first Spanish wine region to adopt the use of stainless steel fermentation tanks. The area is also an important cork production region, with output aimed primarily at the region's Cava houses. Today Catalonia is the second largest producer of wine in Spain, producing over 5.5 million hectolitres."

There has been a recent surge in interest in sweet wines, and Malaga wines are finding their place on the world stage. The main wine villages of this appellation include Frigiliana and Vélez. There are many red and white varietals grown, but the only ones used for dessert wines are the Pedro Ximénez and Moscatel. Malagas classically come in three distinctions (denominación de origen):

Several cooperative wineries were designed and built in the 1920s by Cèsar Martinell, a student of Antoni Gaudí, and are notable for their modernist architectural style."
"Pla de Bages is a Spanish Denominación de Origen Protegida (DOP) (Denominació d'Origen Protegida in Catalan) for Catalan wines, located in the province of Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain), and is one of the smallest DOPs in Spain, covering less than 500 hectares. It is also one of the newest having acquired its official status in 1997."
"Tarragona is a Spanish Denominación de Origen Protegida (DOP) (Denominació d'Origen Protegida in Catalan) for Catalan wines, located in the province of Tarragona (Catalonia, Spain) and covers two distinct areas: the Camp de Tarragona and the Ribera d'Ebre comarca (district)."
"Priorat is a Denominació d'Origen Qualificada (DOQ) for Catalan wines produced in the Priorat county, in the province of Tarragona, in the southwest of Catalonia. The DOQ covers 11 municipalities. It primarily produces powerful red wines, which came to international attention in the 1990s. The area is characterised by its unique terroir of black slate and quartz soil known as llicorella. It is one of only two wine regions in Spain to qualify as DOCa, the highest qualification level for a wine region according to Spanish wine regulations, alongside Rioja DOCa. Priorat is the Catalan word, the one that appears most often on wine labels, while the Castilian equivalent is Priorato."
"Penedès (Catalan pronunciation: [pənəˈðɛs]) is a Spanish Denominación de Origen Protegida (DOP) (Denominació d'Origen Protegida in Catalan) for wines in Catalonia, (Spain). Penedès DOP includes all of the Penedès region and municipalities of four other counties: Anoia, Alt Camp, Baix Llobregat and Tarragonès. The area is framed by the coastal hills of the Garraf Massif and the higher inland mountains which skirt the Central Depression. Long considered one of the country's best wine-producing regions after the Rioja, it is also one of the most ancient viticultural areas in Europe. Perhaps better-known for its Cava production (a sparkling wine which has had its own Denominación de Origen since 1986) white grape varieties predominate, although the region also produces some highly regarded, oak-aged reds."
"Empordà is a Spanish Denominación de Origen Protegida (DOP) (Denominació d'Origen Protegida in Catalan) for wines produced in the northeastern corner of Catalonia, Spain in the province of Girona. The region generally extends from the town of Figueres northwards to the French border and the French wine-making regions of Banyuls and Côtes du Roussillon. To the south, it extends through Baix Empordà near the Mediterranean Sea. The DOP is crossed by the rivers Muga, Llobregat and Manol which flow eastwards to the sea."
"Montsant (Catalan pronunciation: [munˈsan]) is a Spanish Denominación de Origen Protegida (DOP) (Denominació d'Origen Protegida in Catalan) for wine located in the province of Tarragona (Catalonia, Spain) and covers 12 municipalities. It was previously known as the Falset subzone of Tarragona (DO), and was created as a separate DO in the early 2000s. Regional approval came in 2001, and from 2002 wines were sold as Montsant rather than Tarragona.Montsant takes its name from the Montsant mountains in the area. Under the auspices of the DOP Montsant, the region has seen rapid growth, starting with 28 official cellars in 2002 which grew to number 55 currently. Approximately 94% of the production is of red wine with 62% exportation outside Spain, 28% consumed in Catalonia, and 10% sold to the rest of Spain."
"Costers del Segre is a Spanish Denominación de Origen Protegida (DOP) (Denominació d'Origen Protegida in Catalan) for wines located in the province of Lleida (Catalonia, Spain) and is divided into several separate sub-zones. The four original subzones created in 1988 are Artesa, to the northeast of Lleida, to the east, Garrigues and Raïmat. In 1998 two other subzones were added: Pallars Jussà, next to the town of Tremp, 90 km north of Lleida and Segrià to the west and surrounded by the Raimat subzone."
"Conca de Barberà is a Spanish Denominación de Origen Protegida (DOP) (Denominació d'Origen Protegida in Catalan) for wines located in central Catalonia in the northern portion of the Tarragona Province. Situated within the river valleys of the Francolí and Anguera, it has historically been known for its white wines, but has been gaining more attention for its reds, especially those from the native Trepat grape. Today, the Conca de Barberà DOP mainly produces red wines, along with whites, and minor amounts of rosés and sparkling wines."
"Tierra del Vino (literally, ""the Land of Wine"") is a Denominación de Origen of wine, designating wines from the provinces of Zamora and Salamanca. ""Tierra del Vino"" has held a Denomination of Origin since 28 April 2007, when Order AYG/782/07, dated 24, came into effect. The region known as Tierra del Vino lies on both banks of the Duero River as it winds its way through the province of Zamora, and is crossed from North to South by the Roman Silver Road, the Vía de la Plata. It covers a total surface area of 1,799 square kilometres, which extend throughout a total of 56 boroughs; 46 in the province of Zamora and a further ten in the province of Salamanca."
"Pozohondo was a Spanish geographical indication for Vino de la Tierra wines located in the autonomous region of Castilla–La Mancha. Vino de la Tierra is one step below the mainstream Denominación de Origen indication on the Spanish wine quality ladder. The area covered by this geographical indication comprises the municipalities of Alcadozo, Peñas de San Pedro and Pozohondo, located in the province of Albacete, in Castilla–La Mancha, Spain. It acquired its Vino de la Tierra status in 2000, but it is no longer listed."

It acquired its Vino de la Tierra status in 2000,, but it is no longer listed."
"The mainstream quality wine regions in Spain are referred to as denominaciones de origen protegidas (DOP) (similar to the French Appellations) and the wine they produce is regulated for quality according to specific laws, and in compliance with European Commission Regulation (CE) 753/2002. In 2016, the use of the term Denominación de Origen (DO) was updated to Denominación de Origen Protegida (DOP) by the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPA – Ministerio de Agricultura, Pesca y Alimentación); the traditional term of DO can still be used legally on labels, but it will eventually be replaced by DOP. The wine region classification in Spain takes a quite complex hierarchical form in which the denominación de origen protegida is a mainstream grading, equivalent to the French AOC and the Italian DOC. As of 2019, Spain has 138 identifiable wine regions under some form of geographical classification (2 DOCa/DOQ, 68 DO, 7 VC, 19 VP, and 42 VT). The Spanish DO is actually a subset of the EU-sponsored QWPSR (Quality Wine Produced in Specific Regions) regulatory code (vino de calidad producido en región determinada (VCPRD) in Spanish) which Spain formally adopted in 1986, upon accession to the (then) EEC. The Spanish appellation hierarchy was most recently updated in 2016, and is as follows: DOP – denominación de origen protegida ('protected denomination of origin'), is the mainstay of Spain's wine quality control system. Each region is governed by a consejo regulador, which decides on the boundaries of the region, permitted varietals, maximum yields, limits of alcoholic strength and other quality standards or production limitations pertaining to the zone. As of 2019 there are 96 DOPs that are subdivided into DOCa, DO, VP, and VC. The sub-categories can be called DOP, or they can use the traditional terms of DOCa, DO, VP, and VC. DOCa – denominación de origen calificada ('denomination of qualified origin'), is the highest category in Spanish wine regulations, reserved for regions with above-average grape prices and particularly stringent quality controls. Rioja was the first Spanish region to be awarded DOCa status in 1991, followed by Priorat in 2003. Priorat uses the Catalan language DOQ, for denominació d'origen qualificada. These are the only two regions considered ""above"" DO status. DO – denominación de origin, the mainstay of Spain's wine quality control system. Each region is governed by a consejo regulador, which decides on the boundaries of the region, permitted varietals, maximum yields, limits of alcoholic strength and other quality standards or production limitations pertaining to the zone. VP – vino de pago ('estate wine'), a special term for high-quality, single-estate wines (pago is a Spanish term for a vineyard estate) which in some cases also have DO or VC or IGP appellations. This category was formed in 2003. VC – vino de Calidad con indicación geográfica ('quality wine with geographic indication'), a category formed in 2003 along with VP. The VC category is used for wines that do not fully meet the stringent standards of the DO category, but are above the standards of the IGP category. IGP – indicación geográfica protegida ('protected geographic indication'). This is below the DOP level, and is wine originating from a specific place, a region or a country, which has a certain quality, reputation or other characteristic - including production phases - that can be essentially attributed to its geographical origin, at least one of which takes place in the defined geographical area. These can use the traditional term Vino de la Tierra (VT). VdM – vino de mesa ('table wine'), the catch-all at the bottom of the pyramid, for all wine from unclassified vineyards, and wine that has been declassified by blending. This includes both inexpensive jug wines and some expensive wines that are not yet classified due to innovation outside traditional lines. In 2006 a new Vino de la Tierra ""super-region"" was created called Viñedos de España. This was never ratified by the EU, and it was abolished in 2011. Although almost all wine regions are confined to specific centres of production, some of the top denominaciones (Cava and Rioja in particular) are the product of more than one Autonomous Community. This is in contrast to Vinos de Pago, where the location criteria are very strict indeed, often centering on specific plots of land and admitting only those wines produced in their immediate vicinity."
"The Canton of Geneva, officially the Republic and Canton of Geneva (French: République et canton de Genève; Arpitan: Rèpublica et canton de Geneva; German: Republik und Kanton Genf; Italian: Repubblica e Cantone di Ginevra; Romansh: Republica e chantun Genevra), is one of the 26 cantons forming the Swiss Confederation. It is composed of forty-five municipalities and the seat of the government and parliament is in the City of Geneva. Geneva is the French-speaking westernmost canton of Switzerland. It lies at the western end of Lake Geneva and on both sides of the Rhone, its main river. Within the country, the canton shares borders with Vaud to the east, the only adjacent canton. However, the borders of the canton are essentially international, with the French region of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes. As is the case in several other Swiss cantons (Ticino, Neuchâtel, and Jura), Geneva is referred to as a republic within the Swiss Confederation. One of the most populated cantons, Geneva is considered one of the most cosmopolitan regions of the country. As a center of the Calvinist Reformation, the city of Geneva has had a great influence on the canton, which essentially consists of the city and its suburbs. Notable institutions of international importance based in the canton are the University of Geneva, the United Nations and CERN."
"Valais (in French) (UK: /ˈvæleɪ/ VAL-ay, US: /væˈleɪ/ val-AY, French: [valɛ]; Arpitan: Valês), or Wallis (in German) (German: Wallis [ˈvalɪs]), more formally the Canton of Valais, is one of the 26 cantons forming the Swiss Confederation. It is composed of thirteen districts and its capital and largest city is Sion. The flag of the canton is made of thirteen stars representing the districts, on a white-red background. Valais is situated in the southwestern part of the country. It borders the cantons of Vaud and Bern to the north, the cantons of Uri and Ticino to the east, as well as Italy to the south and France to the west. It is one of the three large southern Alpine cantons, along with Ticino and the Grisons. It is a bilingual canton, French and German being its two official languages. Traditionally, the canton is divided into Lower, Central and Upper Valais, the latter region constituting the German-speaking minority. Valais essentially coincides with the valley of the Rhône from its headwaters to Lake Geneva, separating the Pennine Alps from the Bernese Alps. A major wine region, the canton is simultaneously one of the driest regions of Switzerland in its central Rhône valley and among the wettest, having large amounts of snow and rain up on the highest peaks found in Switzerland, such as Monte Rosa and the Finsteraarhorn. Although a major hydroelectricity producer, Valais is essentially renowned for its tourism industry and for its numerous Alpine resort towns, notably Crans-Montana, Saas Fee, Verbier and Zermatt. Overlooking the latter town, the Matterhorn has become an iconic landmark of the canton. In 1529, Valais became an associate member of the Swiss Confederation. After having resisted the Protestant Reformation and remained faithful to the Roman Catholic Church, it became a republic under the guidance of the prince-bishop of Sion in 1628. In 1815, Valais finally entered the Swiss Confederation as a canton."
"The Swiss wine region of Ticino started producing wine in the Roman era, but only after 1906, with the introduction of Merlot, did it begin to produce quality wine. Geographically the wine region is located in the south of Switzerland, and includes the canton Ticino and the neighbouring district of Moesa (Misox and Calanca valleys) in the canton of the Grisons, both areas being Italian-speaking. The terroir varies from acid soil in the northern part to limestone in the southern part. The top quality wines of the region have the appellation del Ticino DOC or ticinese DOC, sometimes linked with a VITI label, and the wines in the medium category use della Svizzera Italiana or nostrano."
"The sub-province Litoměřice (Czech: Litoměřická oblast) is one of two wine regions in Bohemia. It is situated on the Elbe river, with its center in the town of Litoměřice. This area contains 29 official wine municipalities. The history of winery in this north-Bohemian region is longer than 1,000 years."
"The sub-province Mělník (Czech: Mělnická podoblast) is one two wine regions in Bohemia and consists of 37 official wine municipalities. The sub-province is situated on the Elbe river. Although it is named after the town of Mělník in central Bohemia, it contains wineyards located in many parts of Bohemia - in Prague, around Čáslav, Roudnice nad Labem, even in Trutnov under the Giant Mountains. Simply said, all vineyards in Bohemia, that are not part of the sub-province Litoměřice, belong to the sub-province Mělník."
"Mikulovská is one of four Czech wine regions within southern Moravia, Czech Republic. The Mikulovská wine region, containing 30 wine villages, is famed for producing white wines grown in the limestone soils, particularly in and around the area of the Pálava Landscape Protected Area. Historically a centre of viticulture and winemaking in Moravia, Mikulovská is home to the historical town of Mikulov, and the Czech National Wine Centre (Czech: Národní Vinarské Centrum) and Wine Salon of the Czech Republic, located at Valtice Castle."
"Nebraska wine is wine made from grapes grown in the U.S. state of Nebraska. Nebraska's oldest winery was founded in 1994, and about thirty-five commercial wineries operate across the state. Wine quality varies across the state, however several wineries have won Best of Show titles during the States first 25 years of commercial wine production. Five of those titles were won with wines made of the states #1 wine produced from the Variety Edelweiss. Other wins were made with a dry Brianna, Vignole and a Marechel Foch Rose' wine. The vast majority of these wineries are small and sell most of their wine to tourists who visit the winery in person. The University of Nebraska–Lincoln has a program in viticulture. There are no designated American Viticultural Areas in Nebraska."
"Sonoma County wine is wine made in Sonoma County, California, in the United States. County names in the United States automatically qualify as legal appellations of origin for wine produced from grapes grown in that county and do not require registration with the United States Department of the Treasury, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. Sonoma County is one of California's largest producers of wine grapes, far outproducing the Napa Valley AVA."
"Nevada wine refers to wine made from grapes grown in the U.S. state of Nevada, where wine has been produced since 1990. There are currently no designated American Viticultural Areas in Nevada. Nevada has five commercial wineries: Basin and Range Cellars in Reno(opening in June 2018), Nevada Sunset Winery also in Reno,Churchill Vineyards in Fallon, Pahrump Valley Winery in Pahrump and Sanders Family Winery (also located in Pahrump). Locally high boron content of the soil, soil salinity, and hard water provide a few challenges to growing grapes, especially Vitis vinefera. Some environmental elements common to Nevada however are favorable for viticulture; these include the ample sunshine, low humidity (which decreases the risk for rot and mildew and thus the need for fungicides) University of Nevada, Reno professor Dr. Grant Cramer is currently studying the best varietals and techniques at UNR's Valley Road Vineyard. Wine grapes have been grown with success in both the northern and southern part of the state since 1991, and all five wineries have produced wines made from grapes grown in Nevada. Until recently, state law restricted commercial wineries so that they were illegal in counties with more than 100,000 people (Washoe and Clark Counties). This was due to lobbying by the liquor distributors in the State for fight to control the liquor supply. With the passage of Assembly Bill 4 (AB4)in November 2015 this law was changed. Since then three wineries have filed for licenses and began winemaking in Reno (Basin and Range Cellars, Nevada Sunset Winery and Great Basin Winery. The laws for winemaking in Nevada are still considered to be restrictive when compared to neighboring states that have successful wine industries. Additionally, instructional wine-making facilities (such as the Valley Road Vineyard) may operate in any county but must meet special license requirements and are restricted to selling or distributing no more than 60 gallons of wine in any 12-month period."
"Alaska wine refers to wine made in the state of Alaska. Alaskan wineries import juice from out of state to make Merlot, Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir and Riesling. Some wineries produce wine made with fruits other than grapes. Alaska's signature wines are made from honey and native Alaskan fruit such as raspberry, blueberry, strawberry, salmonberry, gooseberry and rhubarb. Some wineries also produce ice wine. There are no designated American Viticultural Areas in the state."
"Wyoming wine refers to wine made from grapes grown in the U.S. state of Wyoming. There are no designated American Viticultural Areas in Wyoming. The state has two commercial wineries, in Huntley and in Sheridan. Table Mountain Vineyards is Wyoming's largest with a 10-acre (40,000 m2) vineyard and produced 3,000 gallons in 2007 from 100% Wyoming grapes. The winery helped pave the way for the Wyoming Grape and Wine Association (WGWA) which focuses on expanding and developing the Wyoming grape industry. Table Mountain Vineyards has paired up with several wineries in western Nebraska to promote wineries along the historic emigration trails, including the Oregon Trail."
"Kansas wine refers to wine made from grapes grown in the U.S. state of Kansas. In the nineteenth century Kansas was a significant grape-growing state. Its latitude, long, sunny growing season and soils ranging from limestone-laced to sandy, can provide favorable conditions for growing grapes if the suitable varieties are planted."
"The wine industry in the U.S. state of Alabama received a boost in 2002 when agricultural reforms lifted restrictions on wineries. Most wineries in the state focus on French hybrid grape varieties and the Muscadine grape, rather than Vitis vinifera grapes, which are vulnerable to Pierce's disease. There are no designated American Viticultural Areas in the state of Alabama."
Florida wine refers to wine made from grapes and other fruit grown in the U.S. state of Florida. Wine grapes were grown in Florida earlier than anywhere else in the United States.
"Missouri wine refers to wine made from grapes grown in Missouri. German immigrants in the early-to-mid-19th century founded the wine industry in Missouri, resulting in its wine corridor being called the Missouri ""Rhineland"". Later Italian immigrants also entered wine production. In the mid-1880s, more wine was produced by volume in Missouri than in any other state. Before prohibition, Missouri was the second-largest wine-producing state in the nation. Missouri had the first area recognized as a federally designated American Viticultural Area with the Augusta AVA acknowledged on June 20, 1980. There are now four AVAs in Missouri. In 2017 there were 125 wineries operating in the state of Missouri, up from 92 in 2009."
"South Carolina wine refers to wine made from grapes grown in the U.S. state of South Carolina. The climate of South Carolina is challenging for the production of wine grapes. Hot and humid summers require viticulturists to adapt their canopy management to minimize direct sunlight on the grapes, which are often harvested early in the summer. There are twelve wineries in South Carolina and no designated American Viticulture Areas."
"Vermont wine refers to wine made from grapes grown in the U.S. state of Vermont. The first commercial winery in Vermont, , opened in 1997. Vermont is a very cold climate for viticulture. Vermont wineries have focused on using cold-hardy French hybrid grapes, but have been experimenting with some Vitis vinifera varieties. Some Vermont wineries produce wine made from grapes grown in other states, especially New York. Vermont is a center for natural wine and biodynamic wine production."
"Utah wine refers to wine made from grapes grown in the U.S. state of Utah. Wine production in Utah, from Utah grown grapes has been on a steady increase since 2018 despite a generally naive Legislative body which frequently changes the regulations pertaining to wine production from legislative session to session. There are no designated American Viticultural Areas in Utah."
"South Dakota wine refers to wine made from grapes grown in the U.S. state of South Dakota. Its region stretches between the latitudes of 42°N and 45°N sharing these latitudes with some of the most famous wine-producing areas in the world, including Bordeaux and Italy's Tuscany. South Dakota has a small wine industry, which must contend with extremes of heat in the summer and cold in the winter. The only grape species that naturally performs well in South Dakota is Vitis riparia, a species not generally used for wine production. The wineries in South Dakota have focused exclusively on cold-resistant French hybrid grapes. At present, there are no American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) in South Dakota, save for the state-level appellation."
"Montana wine refers to wine made from grapes grown in the U.S. state of Montana. There are eight wineries in Montana, with most producing wine from fruits other than grapes or from grapes grown in other states, such as California, Oregon, or Washington. The traditional grape varieties that appear to do best in the mountainous terroir of Montana are the grapes widely grown in the most northerly vineyards of France, with which Montana shares its latitudinal position of 42-49°N. There are no American Viticultural Areas in Montana. One of New Zealand's largest and oldest wineries, Montana Wines, renamed its range to Brancott Estate in 2010 in order to avoid confusion in the United States, New Zealand's largest wine export market."
"Delaware wine refers to wine made from grapes grown in the U.S. state of Delaware. Historically, the first Swedish settlers planted grapes and made wine in Delaware as early as 1638. Delaware has the fewest wineries of any state in the United States. The largest winery is Nassau Valley Vineyards near Lewes, which makes fruit wines in addition to grape wines. Two others are Pizzadili Winery near Felton, a small, family business which opened in 2007 and Harvest Ridge Winery near Marydel, which opened in 2013."
"Washington wine is a wine produced from grape varieties grown in the U.S. state of Washington. Washington ranks second in the United States (behind California) in the production of wine. By 2017, the state had over 55,000 acres (220 km2) of vineyards, a harvest of 229,000 short tons (208,000 t) of grapes, and exports going to over 40 countries around the world from the 940+ wineries located in the state. While there are some viticultural activities in the cooler, wetter western half of the state, the majority (99.9%) of wine grape production takes place in the shrub-steppe eastern half. The rain shadow of the Cascade Range leaves the Columbia River Basin with around 8 inches (200 mm) of annual rain fall, making irrigation and water rights of paramount interest to the Washington wine industry. Viticulture in the state is also influenced by long sunlight hours (on average, two more hours a day than in California during the growing season) and consistent temperatures. The early history of the Washington wine industry can be traced to the introduction of Cinsault grapes by Italian immigrants to the Walla Walla region. In the 1950s and 1960s, the precursors of the state's biggest wineries (Chateau Ste. Michelle and Columbia Winery) were founded. Throughout the rest of the 20th century, the wine world discovered a new aspect of Washington wines with each passing decade – starting with Rieslings and Chardonnays in the 1970s, the Merlot craze of the 1980s and the emergence of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah in the 1990s. Washington has fourteen federally defined American Viticultural Areas with all but one located in Eastern Washington. The largest AVA is the Columbia Valley AVA, which extends into a small portion of northern Oregon and encompasses most of the other Washington AVAs. These include the Lewis-Clark AVA, the Ancient Lakes AVA, Walla Walla Valley AVA, which encompasses The Rocks District of Milton-Freewater AVA, Horse Heaven Hills AVA, the Wahluke Slope AVA, Lake Chelan AVA, Naches Heights AVA, and the Yakima Valley AVA, which in turn also encompasses the Rattlesnake Hills AVA, Snipes Mountain AVA and the Red Mountain AVA. The Columbia Gorge AVA is west of the Columbia Valley AVA. Washington's only AVA located west of the Cascades is the Puget Sound AVA. The Rocks wine-growing region is the newest AVA in Washington state."
"The state of Oregon in the United States has established an international reputation for its production of wine, ranking fourth in the country behind California, Washington, and New York. Oregon has several different growing regions within the state's borders that are well-suited to the cultivation of grapes; additional regions straddle the border between Oregon and the states of Washington and Idaho. Wine making dates back to pioneer times in the 1840s, with commercial production beginning in the 1960s. American Viticultural Areas entirely within the state are the Willamette Valley AVA (with 9 nested AVAs) and the Southern Oregon AVA with (5 nested AVAs). Parts of the Columbia Gorge, Walla Walla Valley, and Snake River Valley AVAs lie within Oregon. Pinot noir and Pinot Gris are the top two grapes grown, with over 59,452 short tons (53,934 t) harvested in 2016. Oregon winemakers sold just under 3.4 million cases in 2016. With 908 wineries in Oregon, a tourism industry has developed around wine tasting. Much of the tourism focuses on the wineries and tasting rooms in and around the Yamhill Valley southwest of Portland. It is estimated that enotourism contributed USD $207.5 million to the state economy in 2013 excluding sales at wineries and tasting rooms."
"The Grampians is an Australian wine region located in the state of Victoria, west of Melbourne. It is located near the Grampians National Park and the Pyrenees hills. The area is dominated by red wine production, particularly Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon."
"The King Valley, or King River Valley is a wine-producing and agricultural region centred on the King River between Wangaratta and the Alpine National Park in the North East Victoria zone of the Australian state of Victoria. There are a number of small towns within the region including Cheshunt, Whitfield, , , , Moyhu, , Docker and Oxley. King Valley was recorded as an Australian Geographical Indication protected name on 12 October 2007."
"The Mornington Peninsula is an Australian wine region located south of Melbourne, Victoria. The region has a cool climate making wine growing ideal and focuses on Pinot noir production but has had success with other varietals including Chardonnay, Pinot gris and Tempranillo. The region is known for its medium bodied, dry wines and sparkling wines that show structure and complexity. The still wine versions of Chardonnay reflect a diversity of styles, all typically oaked, from more citrus to more tropical fruit flavors."
"The Yarra Valley is an Australian wine region located east of Melbourne, Victoria. It is a cool climate region that is best known for producing Chardonnay, sparkling wine and Pinot noir. Its proximity to the urban centre and high profile wineries have made it an important destination for enotourism, receiving over 3.1 million visitors in 2011."
"The Bellarine Peninsula (Wathawurrung: Balla-wein or Biteyong) is a peninsula located south-west of Melbourne in Victoria, Australia, surrounded by Port Phillip, Corio Bay and Bass Strait. The peninsula, together with the Mornington Peninsula, separates Port Phillip Bay from Bass Strait. The peninsula itself was originally occupied by Indigenous Australian clans of the Wathaurong nation, prior to European settlement in the early 19th century. Early European settlements were initially centred on wheat and grain agriculture, before the area became a popular tourist destination with most visitors arriving by paddle steamer on Port Phillip in the late 19th century. Today, approximately 55,000 people live on the peninsula and unlike its cousin, the Mornington Peninsula, this number increases only slightly during peak tourist months. However, the peninsula is a growing tourist region with a variety of beaches and seaside resorts and wineries; most of the peninsula is a part of the City of Greater Geelong."
"Western Australian wine refers to wine produced in Australia's largest state, Western Australia. Although the state extends across the western third of the continent, its wine regions are almost entirely situated in the cooler climate of its south-western tip. Western Australia produces less than 5% of the country's wine output, but in quality terms it is very much near the top - winning 30 percent of the countries' medals."
"Margaret River is the major geographical indication wine region in southwest Western Australia, with 5,017 hectares under vine and 215 wineries as at 2012. Margaret River wine region is made up predominantly of boutique size wine producers; although winery operations range from the smallest crushing 3.5 tonne per year to the largest around 7000 tonne. The climate of Margaret River is more strongly maritime-influenced than any other major Australian region. It has the lowest mean annual temperature range, of only 7.6 °C, and as well as the most marked Mediterranean climate in terms of rainfall, with only 2000 millimetres of the annual 1160 millimetres falling between October and April. The low diurnal and seasonal temperature range means an unusually even accumulation of warmth. Overall the climate is similar to that of Bordeaux in a dry vintage. Although the region produces just three percent of total Australian grape production, it produces over 20 percent of Australia's premium wine market. The principal grape varieties are fairly evenly split between red and white; Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc, Sémillon, Shiraz, Merlot, Chenin blanc and Verdelho."
"The Swan Valley is a region in the upper reaches of the Swan River between Guildford and Bells Rapids, Western Australia. It is bordered to the east by the Darling Scarp. Both Ellenbrook and Jane Brook lie within the region and discharge into the Swan River. There are seven suburbs within the region: Baskerville, Belhus, Caversham, Henley Brook, Herne Hill, Millendon and West Swan. It is part of the City of Swan local government area. The Swan Valley Australian Geographical Indication is a sub-region of the larger Swan District wine region. Swan Valley was registered on 6 January 2003 following Swan District being registered on 10 December 1998."
"The Great Southern wine region is in Western Australia's Great Southern region. It comprises an area 200 kilometres (120 mi) from east to west and over 100 kilometres (62 mi) from north to south, and is Australia's largest wine region. It has five nominated subregions for wine, the Porongurups, Mount Barker, Albany, Denmark and Frankland River under the geographical indications legislation as determined by the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. The vineyards spread throughout the area known for production of high quality vines have significant variations of terroir and climate dictated in part by the distance however the region is the coolest of Western Australia's viticultural areas, with a similar maritime influenced Mediterranean climate to Margaret River although with slightly less rainfall. This diverse region is known for Riesling, Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, pinot noir, Shiraz, and Malbec."
"Blackwood Valley is a wine region in the south-west of Western Australia, approximately 260 km (160 mi) south-south-east of Perth. The region was named after the Blackwood River, the longest continually flowing river in Western Australia. The river passes through the towns of Bridgetown, Greenbushes, Nannup, Balingup and Boyup Brook within the region."
"Barbera d'Asti is an Italian red wine made from the Barbera grape. It is produced in the hilly areas of the provinces of Asti (67 municipalities) and Alexandria (51 municipalities). Barbera d'Asti was accredited with DOC status in 1970, and DOCG status followed in 2008. Under the DOCG rules, a minimum of 90% Barbera grapes must be used; the balance may be made up with either Freisa, Grignolino or Dolcetto grapes. The wine must be made before the date of 1 March immediately following the harvest, and must reach an alcohol content of 11.5%. Since 2000, it has been possible to produce Barbera d'Asti Superiore, for which the wine must have an alcoholic strength of at least 12.5% by volume, and be aged for at least 14 months, 6 months of which stored in oak or chestnut barrels. Many superiore producers refine it in small oak barriques to obtain a rounder taste. The superiore has the following sub-zones indicated on the label: Nizza, Tinella, or Colli Astiani (Asti). The superiore wine has a strong additional aging potential; it can often be aged from ten to twenty years. The Nizza DOCG was added to Asti's Barbera portfolio in 2014. The Nizza production rules require the use of 100% Barbera grapes, a maximum yield of 7 tonnes per hectare, and minimum aging of 18 months, of which 6 months must be in oak barrels. The minimum alcoholic strength is 13%, or 13.5% if produced by a single, named vineyard."
"Maryland wine is wine made in the U.S. state of Maryland. The industry has grown rapidly since the first winery in Maryland, Boordy Vineyards, opened in 1945. It is estimated that the industry contributes $50 million annually to the Maryland economy."
"Clairette de Die AOC is a natural sparkling white wine from the Rhône Valley region in France. It is made from the Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains (75% minimum) and Clairette (25% maximum) grape varieties. It is characterized by its peach and apricot flavours and rose and honeysuckle aromas, and is usually drunk young at a maximum of two years, and served chilled at a temperature of 6°C to 8°C. Crémant de Die from the same area and same producers is a prestige dry, natural sparkling wine of apple and green fruit flavours and fragrance and is vinified by the traditional method of a first fermentation in the vat followed by a second fermentation in the bottle. Originally produced from 100% Clairette, Aligoté and Muscat are now included. It is usually drunk as an aperitif but it can equally accompany a meal. It contains less alcohol then most other sparkling wines : ca. 7 or 8 % where 12 is usual for some other sparkling wines."
"Dingač is a wine growing region on the Pelješac Peninsula in the Dalmatian region of Croatia that is part of the larger, Coastal (Primorska) Region. Situated on the southwestern facing slope of the Zabrada mountains between the small villages of Trstenik and Podobuče, it is a highly regarded area for growing the autochthonous Croatian red wine grape, Plavac Mali. Like the neighboring Postup region, the land is very rugged karst with little top soil. This attribute, in addition to the level of sunlight (2800 hours annually), 45 degree slope, and weather make for ideal red wines growing conditions which are planted from sea level up to 300 m. The wines derived from this area are eligible for a ""stamp of geographic origin"" if they meet a series of strict requirements and can reach upwards of 17.6% alcohol. The wine region was established in 1961 and was the first protected Croatian wine region. The area is not very accessible but a small, rural road runs the length of the region. Also, at Potomje is the entrance to a one lane tunnel through the mountain that winemakers paid to build in 1973 in order to transport grapes directly. This replaced the old system of using donkeys to carry harvested grapes over the 400 m high pass of the mountain. Notable producers of Dingač region wines include: Matuško, Vinarija Dingač, Bura-Mokalo, Miloš, Kiridžija, Benmosché, Indijan and Bartulović among others."
"Postup is wine growing region on Croatia's Pelješac peninsula just to the east of Orebić. It takes its name from the small village that sits at the center of it. The main grape harvested in Postup is Plavac Mali and, like the grapes from the region of nearby Dingač, the grapes grown here are held in high regard. Postup was the second Croatian wine region, after Dingač, to be registered for state protection (today Protected Geographical Status) in 1967. Postup straddles the Adriatic Sea with views across the Pelješac Channel to the islands of Korčula and Badija as well as across the Mljet Channel to the islands of Mljet and Lastovo. The region can be accessed via the road leading from Orebić to Ston (the D414) on a smaller route leading to the villages of Borje and Podubuče. The wines grown in Postup are typically crushed, bottled, and aged in nearby Potomje where most of the main wineries for Pelješac are located. While they don't approach the robust character typical of Plavac Mali-based wines from Dingač, they are still able to develop a fuller body than those grown in the interior due to the slope of the vineyards as well as the sunlight reflected from the Adriatic Sea. The grapes are also considerably easier to harvest than those of Dingač due to a more established infrastructure. Notable producers of Postup region wines include: Vinarija Dingač, Bura-Mokalo, Indijan and Bartulović among others."
"Cornas is a French wine Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) in the northern Rhône wine region of France based in Cornas, south of Lyon. It is one of the smallest appellations in the Rhône valley and produces only red wine, from the Syrah grape."
"Hermitage is a French wine Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) in the northern Rhône wine region of France south of Lyon. It produces mostly red wine from the Syrah grape; however, small quantities of white wine are also produced from Roussane and Marsanne grapes. The hill is seen by some as the spiritual home of the Syrah grape variety."
"Iowa wine refers to wine manufactured in the U.S. state of Iowa. Iowa presents many challenges to viticulture including very warm summer days that can promote fungal vine diseases, and extremely cold winter nights that can kill many varieties of grapevines. Most commercial viticulture in Iowa focuses on French hybrid and native American grape varieties, with relatively few plantings of Vitis vinifera grapes. Many Iowa wineries also import grapes and juice from other states and countries in order to produce wine varietals otherwise not possible due to Iowa's harsh winter months that will not permit such grapes to survive. Iowa is home to 100 commercial wineries and more than 300 vineyards covering 1,200+ acres. Northeastern Iowa is included in the Upper Mississippi Valley AVA while the western part of the state is in the new AVA designation named Loess Hills."
"Arizona wine refers to wine made from grapes grown in the U.S. state of Arizona. There are three major regions of vineyards and wineries in Arizona: 
* Verde Valley – north of Phoenix on SR-260 and SR-89A near Sedona 
* Sonoita – south of Tucson on SR-83 
* Willcox – east of Tucson on the I-10 Most vineyards in Arizona are located in the southeastern portion of the state south and east of Tucson, which is also the location of Arizona's two designated AVA's (American Viticultural Area), the Sonoita AVA (established in 1985) and the Willcox AVA (established in 2016). Arizona has enjoyed recent success with wine made from the grape varieties native to Italy and the Rhône valley of southern France. It is not clear when viticulture and winemaking first began in Arizona. In 1703, the famous Jesuit missionary and explorer Eusebio Francisco Kino reported growing grapes and making wine for Mass at his mission of Dolores in nearby Sonora. However historic records suggest there was very little winemaking in Arizona itself during the Spanish period since many of the missions and settlements were not in good winegrowing locations. During the territorial period, farmers in the Salt River Valley around Phoenix began making wine in the mid-1870s and a small winemaking industry eventually emerged in nearby Mesa during the 1880s. In northern Arizona, Henry Schuerman established a farm and orchard along Oak Creek in the Verde Valley and later planted a large vineyard to make wine for the nearby mining camp of Jerome. In the fall of 1914, Arizonans voted to go dry and banned the sale and consumption of alcohol, effectively ending Arizona's budding wine industry. Starting in the mid-1970s, Dr. Gordon Dutt, a soil scientist at the University of Arizona, conducted experiments that demonstrated that parts of Arizona could produce quality wine grapes. Dutt went on to found Vina Sonoita Vineyards – the first modern commercial wine vineyard in Arizona. In 1980, Navy veteran Robert Webb opened the R. W. Webb Winery in Tucson and later established a vineyard south of Willcox. Other pioneering Arizona winemakers during the 1980s and 1990s included William Staltari, Tino Ocheltree, Al Buhl, and Kent Callaghan. There now are over 110 wineries, vineyards and cellars throughout Arizona, including in the cities of Phoenix and Tucson. The wineries, vineyards and cellars are supported by three state and regional organizations: the Arizona Wine Growers Association, a non-profit NGO representing, educating and promoting the state's wine industry, Willcox Wine Country , a non-profit dedicated to increasing viability of wineries and vineyards in the southeast portion of Arizona, and by the Arizona Vignerons Alliance(AZVA), a non-profit organization collecting data on all Arizona wine-growing regions, ensuring authenticity of Arizona wine and working to promote Arizona wine as recognized, respected and sought-after in Arizona, the U.S., and globally. AWGA supports the wine industry through promotional events, state awards to the best wines in Arizona and industry lobbying efforts at the local, state and national level. AZVA establishes parameters for growing grapes and producing wines in Arizona; verifies, certifies and promotes 100% Arizona wine; collects, evaluates and shares Arizona viniculture data; holds the annual AZVA Symposium and Wine tasting and participates in existing regional and international events to raise national and global awareness of Arizona wine; and promotes truth in labeling by giving the consumer and wine professional accurate information based on a data-driven and fact-based approach to wine labeling. The Southwest Wine Center, established in 2009, is part of Yavapai College's Verde Valley Campus. SWC provides education and training for the AZ wine industry through Yavapai College's Viticulture and Enology Program. Students at YC can earn an AA in Viticulture and Enology or a certificate in Viticulture or Enology."
"Arkansas wine refers to wine made from grapes grown in the U.S. state of Arkansas. Many of these wines are grown from traditional European wine grapes of the Vitis vinifera group such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, and Riesling but Arkansas also makes wine from its native grapes, the Cynthiana and Muscadine."
"Colorado wine refers to wine made from grapes grown in the U.S. state of Colorado. Most of Colorado's vineyards are located on the western slope of the Rocky Mountains, though an increasing number of wineries are located along the Front Range."
"Connecticut wine refers to wine made from grapes and other fruit grown in the U.S. state of Connecticut. The modern wine industry in Connecticut began with the passage of the Connecticut Winery Act in 1978. The wineries in Connecticut are located throughout the state, including in the three designated American Viticultural Areas in the state. The climate in the coastal region near Long Island Sound and the Connecticut River valley tends to be warmer than the highlands in the eastern and western sides of the state."
"Hawaii wine refers to wine made from the U.S. state of Hawaii. The island of Maui is where the bulk of the state's wine is produced though there is some production on the island of Hawaii. The state mainly produces fruit wine such as a pineapple sparkling wine. In July 2021, the was designated on Maui, the first American Viticultural Area in Hawaii and the only outside of the contiguous United States."
"Idaho wine refers to wine made from the U.S. state of Idaho. Idaho has a long history of wine production with the first vineyards in the Pacific Northwest being planted here in the 1860s. Like in other areas Prohibition in the United States virtually wiped out the Idaho wine industry in the early twentieth century, only to be resurrected in the 1970s. Today Idaho's wine industry is its fastest growing agricultural industry."
"Illinois wine refers to any wine that is made from grapes grown in the U.S. state of Illinois. In 2006, Shawnee Hills, in southern Illinois, was named the state's first American Viticultural Area. As of 2008, there were 79 wineries in Illinois, utilizing approximately 1,100 acres (4.5 km2) of vines."
"Indiana wine refers to wine made from grapes grown in the U.S. state of Indiana. Wine has been produced in the area since the early days of European colonization in the 18th century. In the mid-19th century, Indiana was the tenth-largest winegrape producing state in the country. There are two American Viticultural Areas (AVA) in Indiana: the Ohio River Valley AVA which also contains portions of Kentucky and Ohio, and the Indiana Uplands AVA which is wholly located in south-central Indiana and includes the oldest and most prolific winery in Indiana, Oliver Winery."
"Kentucky wine refers to wine made from grapes grown in the U.S. commonwealth of Kentucky. About 65 wineries operate commercially in Kentucky, with most recent plantings focusing on Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, and Cabernet Franc. Kentucky produced over two million gallons of wine in 2011 and is the largest wine-producing state by volume in the American South. Kentucky passed legislation in 1976 allowing wineries to operate, and tobacco settlement funds have provided Kentucky farmers the opportunity to once again explore grapes as a cash crop."
"Louisiana wine refers to wine made from grapes grown in the U.S. state of Louisiana. Growing grapes in Louisiana is challenging which has hindered its wine industry. The climate of Louisiana is extremely hot and humid, and viticulturists in the state face Pierce's disease, powdery mildew, and other grapevine diseases. There are four commercial wineries in Louisiana that collectively produce about 20,000 gallons (75,000 liters) of wine per year. One of those commercial wineries is Landry Vineyards which is the largest vineyard and winery in Northeast Louisiana however it produces most of its wine by importing grapes from the west coast. To ensure that the Louisiana wine you are getting is actually made from Louisiana grapes or fruit look for ""Louisiana"" on the label. Another Louisiana vineyard is Pontchartrain Vineyards. Louisiana wine industry is small but growing."
"Maine wine is made from fruit grown in the U.S. state of Maine. Most is made from fruit other than grapes, including apple, cranberry, and blueberry wines. A few wineries in Maine produce limited quantities of wine made from locally grown French hybrid grape varieties. Maine's climate is too cold for viticulture."
"Massachusetts wine refers to wine made from grapes grown in the U.S. state of Massachusetts. Most of the wine grape vineyards and wineries in Massachusetts are located in the southern half of the state, within the boundaries of the Southeastern New England AVA. Although the coastal conditions moderate the cold climate, many wineries rely upon cold-hardy French hybrid varietals like Seyval, Vidal, and Marechal Foch. There are over 55 wineries in Massachusetts, and one designated American Viticultural Area, the Martha's Vineyard AVA, located entirely within the boundaries of the state."
"Michigan wine refers to any wine that is made in the state of Michigan in the United States. As of 2018, there were 3,050 acres (1,230 ha) under wine-grape cultivation and 148 commercial wineries in Michigan, producing 3 million US gallons (11,000,000 L) of wine. According to another count there were 112 operating wineries in Michigan in 2007. Wine and enotourism were estimated in 2007 to be a $300 million industry. Most of the quality bottled wine of Michigan is produced in the five American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) of Fennville AVA, Lake Michigan Shore AVA, Leelanau Peninsula AVA, Old Mission Peninsula AVA, and the Tip of the Mitt AVA. There are also a few disjunct wineries in every region of the state, including some in the Upper Peninsula that have opened over the past several years.In addition to grape wine, Michigan is a leader in the production of fruit wines such as cherry wine."
"Minnesota wine refers to wine made from grapes grown in the U.S. state of Minnesota. Minnesota is part of the largest American Viticultural Area (AVA), the Upper Mississippi River Valley AVA, which includes southwest Wisconsin, southeast Minnesota, northeast Iowa, and northwest Illinois. The state also has a smaller designated American Viticultural Areas, the Alexandria Lakes AVA. Minnesota is a very cold climate for viticulture and many grape varieties require protection from the winter weather by being buried under soil for the season. Minnesota is home to extensive research on cold-hardy French hybrid and other grape varieties. The Minnesota Grape Growers Association (MGGA) is a statewide organization that promotes grape growing and wine making in the state and also in cold-hardy climates. Minnesota is home to the (ICCWC) hosted annually in partnership between MGGA and University of Minnesota. This is the only wine competition solely dedicated to the promotion of quality wines made mainly from cold-hardy grape varieties. In 2014, the 6th annual competition saw 284 wines entered from 59 commercial wineries in 11 states. Awards were based on blind tastings by 21 expert judges, who include enologists, wine writers, restaurateurs, retailers, and wine educators."
"Mississippi wine refers to wine made from grapes grown in the U.S. state of Mississippi. The hot and humid climate of Mississippi makes it very difficult to cultivate vitis vinifera or French hybrid grapes. The three commercial wineries in Mississippi focus almost entirely on the Muscadine grape, a variety also used for non-alcoholic grape juices, jams, and jellies. Most of the Mississippi Delta AVA, a designated American Viticultural Area, lies within the state boundaries of Mississippi."
"New Hampshire wine refers to wine made from grapes grown in the U.S. state of New Hampshire. The wine industry in New Hampshire began in 1994 when two wineries, Jewell Towne Vineyards and Flag Hill Winery, each produced their first vintages from locally grown grapes. Candia Vineyards started their test plantings in 1992, and full planting in 1998. New Hampshire continues to be growing wine-producing state, with new commercial wineries opening. The state currently has no American Viticultural Areas."
"New Mexico has a long history of wine production, within American wine, especially along the Rio Grande, from its capital Santa Fe, the city of Albuquerque with its surrounding metropolitan area, and in valleys like the Mesilla and the Mimbres River valleys. In 1629, Franciscan friar García de Zúñiga and a Capuchín monk named Antonio de Arteaga planted the first wine grapes in Santa Fe de Nuevo México, in what would become the modern Middle Rio Grande Valley AVA. Today, wineries exist in the aforementioned Middle Rio Grande Valley, as well as the Mesilla Valley AVA and the Mimbres Valley AVA. Viticulture took hold since its 1629 introduction, in the middle Rio Grande and the surrounding area, and by the year 1880 grapes were grown on over 3,000 acres (12 km2), and wineries produced over 1,000,000 US gallons (3,800,000 L) of wine. The editor of the Socorro bulletin predicted in 1880 that ""We see in the present attention given to grape culture, an important and growing industry which, in a few years, will assume proportions of no ordinary nature."" The wine industry in New Mexico declined in the latter decades of the nineteenth century in part due to flooding of the Río Grande. Prohibition in the United States also forced many wineries to close, while others remained operational providing sacramental wine to primarily Catholic as well as other Christian churches. The modern New Mexico wine industry received significant support in 1978 when a government-sponsored study encouraged winegrowers to grow New Mexican heritage grapes, and to work in collaboration with Italian, Spanish and French wineries to make hybrid grape varieties. New Mexico now has more than 60 wineries producing 900,000 US gallons (3,400,000 L) of wine annually."
New York wine refers to wine made from grapes grown in the U.S. state of New York. New York ranks third in grape production by volume after California and Washington. Eighty-three percent of New York's grape area is Vitis labrusca varieties (mostly Concord). The rest is split almost equally between Vitis vinifera and French hybrids.
"North Carolina wine refers to wine made from grapes grown in the U.S. state of North Carolina. Wine has been produced in the area since the early days of European colonization in the 17th century. Wine growers in North Carolina were the first to cultivate a Native American grape variety, the Scuppernong, which produces a sweet wine, examples of which are still being made in the state. Most wine produced in North Carolina since the year 2000 is made from Vitis vinifera grape varieties, although French hybrid and Vitis labrusca varieties remain common."
"North Dakota wine refers to wine made from grapes grown in the U.S. state of North Dakota. North Dakota was the last state in the United States since Prohibition to license a commercial winery. The first bonded commercial winery in North Dakota, Pointe of View Winery, was established on April 17, 2002. Pointe of View Winery has since been joined by a second winery, , but both wineries focus on wine made from fruits other than grapes. Red Trail Vineyard, North Dakota's largest, makes wines exclusively from its grapes."
"Ohio wine (or ""Ohioan wine"") refers to wine made from grapes grown in the U.S. state of Ohio. Historically, this has been wine grown from native American species of grapes (such as Vitis labrusca), not European wine grapes, although hybrid and Vitis vinifera grapes are now common in Ohio. As of 2018 there were 280 commercial wineries operating in Ohio, and there are five designated American Viticultural Areas partially or completely located within the state."
"Oklahoma wine refers to wine made from grapes grown in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. Wine production was a significant component of the Oklahoma agricultural economy in the 1920s. The industry was destroyed by the Dust Bowl of the 1930s and the introduction of Prohibition in the United States. Oklahoma currently has about 52 wineries. Most of the wineries are located in Green Country (Northeast Oklahoma), Lincoln county and surrounding areas in east central Oklahoma, Central Oklahoma and Southwest Oklahoma. There is currently one designated American Viticultural Area in Oklahoma, the Ozark Mountain AVA."
"Pennsylvania wine refers to wine made from grapes grown in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. The climate in Pennsylvania is mild compared to surrounding states, with the moderating effects of Lake Erie to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the east. 119 wineries are located in all parts of the state, including five designated American Viticultural Areas. Pennsylvania is the eighth-largest wine producing state in the country. The commercial wine industry had important roots in Pennsylvania. Around 1740, the first hybrid of vitis vinifera European grapes and vitis labrusca North American grapes was discovered near Philadelphia. It was initially named Alexander, after the gardener who discovered it. In 1786, Frenchman Pierre 'Peter' Legaux founded the Pennsylvania Vine Company, also just outside of Philadelphia, which would become the nation's first commercial vineyard."
"Banyuls is a French appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) for a fortified apéritif or dessert wine made from old vines cultivated in terraces on the slopes of the Catalan Pyrenees in the Roussillon county of France, bordering, to the south, the Empordà wine region in Catalonia in Spain. The AOC production area is limited to four communes of the Côte Vermeille: Banyuls (from which the AOC takes its name), Cerbère, Collioure and Port-Vendres. The boundaries of the AOC are identical with the Collioure AOC. Banyuls Grand Cru is an AOC for superior wines that would otherwise be classified as simply Banyuls. They must be matured for 30 months. The grapes permitted are the same."
"Saint-Julien is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) for red wine in the Bordeaux region, located in the Médoc subregion. It takes its name from the commune Saint-Julien-Beychevelle and is one of the six communal appellations in Médoc. A number of classified (Grand Cru Classé) Bordeaux estates are located within the appellation."
"Saint-Estèphe is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) for red wine in the Bordeaux region, located in the Médoc subregion. It takes its name from the commune of Saint-Estèphe and is the northernmost of the six communal appellations in Médoc. Five classified growths of 1855 (Bordeaux Grands Crus Classés en 1855) are located within the appellation area. Saint-Estèphe has held AOC recognition since 1936."
"Cadillac is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) for sweet white wine from the Bordeaux wine region in France. It is located within the Entre-Deux-Mers subregion of Bordeaux. It takes its name from the town of Cadillac. In 2008, the area under cultivation was 128 hectares (320 acres), producing 6,000 hectolitres of wine."
"Médoc is an AOC for wine in the Bordeaux wine region of southwestern France, on the Left Bank of the Gironde estuary that covers the northern section of the viticultural strip along the Médoc peninsula. The zone is sometimes called Bas-Médoc (English: Low-Médoc), though this term is not permitted on any label. With few exceptions there is produced only red wine, and no white wine has the right to be called Médoc. The term Médoc is often used in a geographical sense to refer to the whole Left Bank region, and as defined by the original Institut National des Appellations d'Origine (INAO) decree of November 14, 1936, the appellation may be applied to all wine produced in the prescribed zone in the peninsula, but this is rare practice by estates within Médoc's sub-appellations as it carries lesser perceived prestige. Effectively it covers the northern third of the Médoc peninsula, defined by a border that runs from Saint-Yzans and Saint-Germain-d'Esteuil (at the northern edges of Haut-Médoc AOC and Saint-Estèphe AOC) in the south, to Soulac-sur-Mer in the north, although viticultural activity ends near Vensac. In all sixteen wine-producing communes are exclusive to Médoc, and Bégadan, Saint-Christoly, Ordonnac, Saint-Yzans and Saint-Germain-d'Esteuil have historically enjoyed a reputation level to communes of the northern Haut-Médoc. Predominantly an area of cooperatives today, none of the estates were included in the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855, although several have been included in the (eventually discontinued) classification Cru Bourgeois."
"Puligny-Montrachet wine is produced in the commune of Puligny-Montrachet in Côte de Beaune of Burgundy. The Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) Puligny-Montrachet may be used for white wine and red with respectively Chardonnay and Pinot noir as the main grape variety. However, almost only white Puligny-Montrachet is produced, at around 99.5 per cent of the total production. There are four Grand Cru vineyards within Puligny-Montrachet, with Montrachet the most well-known, and 17 Premier Cru vineyards. In 2008, there were 207.98 hectares (513.9 acres) of vineyard surface was in production for Puligny-Montrachet wine at village and Premier Cru level, and 10,844 hectoliters of wine was produced, of which 10,792 hectoliters white wine and 52 hectoliters red wine. Some 3.67 hectares (9.1 acres) of this area was used for the red wines in 2007. The amount produced corresponds to slightly less than 1.5 million bottles of which slightly less than 7,000 bottles were red wine. For white wines, the AOC regulations allow both Chardonnay and Pinot blanc to be used, but most wines are 100% Chardonnay. The AOC regulations also allow up to 15 per cent total of Chardonnay, Pinot blanc and Pinot gris as accessory grapes in the rare red wines, but this not very often practiced. The allowed base yield is 45 hectoliters per hectare for white wine (40 for red wine). The grapes must reach a maturity of at least 11.0 per cent potential alcohol for village-level white wine (10.5 for red) and 11.5 per cent for Premier Cru white wine (11.0 for red). The style of white Puligny-Montrachet is often very mineral, with a more restrained oak character compared to the white wines of some of the other Côte de Beaune villages, and tends to be described as ""elegant"" rather than fruit-driven, although some aspects of the style (such as the level of fruitiness) varies somewhat between producers and specific vineyards."
"Pouilly-Fuissé (French pronunciation: ​[pu.ji fɥi.se]) is an appellation (AOC) for white wine in the Mâconnais subregion of Burgundy in central France, located in the communes of Fuissé, Solutré-Pouilly, Vergisson and Chaintré. Pouilly-Fuissé has Chardonnay as the only grape variety. Pouilly-Fuissé is the best-known part of Mâconnais. The AOC was created on 11 September 1936. It was granted premier cru designation in September 2020. There are currently 22 premier cru climats. The area used to be known simply as ""Pouilly"", but when the AOC laws were introduced, it was split into three: Pouilly-Fuissé, Pouilly-Loché and Pouilly-Vinzelles."
"Pouilly-sur-Loire is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) for white wine in the Loire Valley region of France. It is specifically produced around Pouilly-sur-Loire in the Nièvre department and was awarded AOC status by a decree issued on July 31, 1937"
Orléans is an Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) for wine in the Loire Valley wine region of France situated around the city of Orléans.
"Châteauneuf-du-Pape is a French wine, an Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) located around the village of Châteauneuf-du-Pape in the Rhône wine region in southeastern France. It is one of the most renowned appellations of the southern part in the Rhône Valley, and its vineyards are located around Châteauneuf-du-Pape and in neighboring villages, Bédarrides, Courthézon and Sorgues, between Avignon and Orange. They cover slightly more than 3,200 hectares or 7,900 acres (32 km2) and produce over 110,000 hectolitres of wine a year, more wine made in this one area of the southern Rhône than in all of the northern Rhône."
"Beaumes de Venise is an appellation of wines from the eastern central region of the southern half of the Rhône Valley. It produces wines of two distinctly different types: 1. A sweet fortified wine of the type vin doux naturel (VDN), under the designation Muscat de Beaumes de Venise. 2. A red Côtes du Rhône Villages from the classification of named villages, which typifies the quality wines of the Côtes du Rhône region. The vines are grown on the slopes around the foot of the Dentelles de Montmirail, a vertical comb of rock jutting out of the plain between the Rhône river and the Luberon-Ventoux mountains. Beaumes is famed for its natural fortified wine made from the Muscat grape, and records of its use go back almost two millennia. More recently it is also the producer of a high quality red wine. In 1943 the natural Sweet Beaumes de Venise Muscat was accorded its appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC), to be followed in 1956 by an AOC for its Côtes du Rhône. The red, white and rosé wines were elevated to the appellation of Côtes-du-Rhône Villages AOC (named villages) in 1978, and in 2005 the greatest honor of all was bestowed on the region when Beaumes de Venise rouge and the sweet fortified wine Muscat de Beaumes de Venise became a cru - the highest order of the wines in the Rhône Valley.

"Azerbaijani wine is produced in several regions throughout Azerbaijan. Prior to 20th century communist rule, Azerbaijan had a thriving wine industry that dated back to the second millennium BC. Azerbaijan's long history of wine production was rediscovered at archaeological digs of settlements in Kültəpə, Qarabağlar and Galajig where archaeologists discovered stone fermentation and storage vessels that included residue and grape seeds dating back to the second millennium BC. The Ancient Greeks were well aware of wine production in the area by at least the 7th century BC according to Herodotus. Later Strabo would comment in the 1st century BC about an Azerbaijani wine known as Albania. Arabic historians and geographers—most notably Abu'l-Fida, Al-Masudi, Ibn Hawqal and Al-Muqaddasi - described the extensive viticulture around Ganja and Barda that was taking place even after Islamic conquest of the area. Since the fall of Communism and the restoration of Azerbaijani independence, ardent attempts have been made to revive and modernize the Azerbaijani wine industry. Today vineyards are found in the foothills of Caucasus Mountains as well and the Kur-Araz lowlands near the Kura River. In the 21st century, Ganja, Nagorno-Karabakh and Nakhchivan have emerged as centers of wine production in the region. Among the grape varieties used to produce Azerbaijani wine include Pinot noir, Rkatsiteli, Pinot blanc, Aligote, Matrassa, , , , , Viorica and . Local grape varieties indigenous to Azerbaijan include White Shani, , , Bayanshire, , , , Madrasa, , , Zeynabi, , , , , and Marandi."
"Virginia wine refers to wine made primarily from grapes grown in the commonwealth of Virginia. Wine has been produced in the area since the early days of European colonization in the 17th century. Virginia has hot humid summers that can be challenging to viticulture, and only within the last twenty years has the industry developed beyond novelty status. By tonnage, Vitis vinifera varieties represents 75% of total production. French hybrids varieties account for nearly 20% of total wine grape production in the commonwealth, while American varietals make up only about 5% of the total. As of 2012, the top 5 varietals produced are Chardonnay, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Vidal blanc and Viognier. As of 2016, the commonwealth has approximately 2,600 acres (11 km2) under cultivation, with a total harvest of over 6500 tons. The commonwealth ranks fifth in the nation for both bearing acreage and grape production. The central and northern Virginia counties, in particular those located just east of the Blue Ridge Mountains, account for the significant majority of the commonwealth's production."
"Rhode Island wine refers to wine made from grapes grown in the U.S. state of Rhode Island. Viticulture in Rhode Island began in 1663 when King Charles II of England included wine production among the land uses approved in the royal charter establishing Rhode Island as an English colony.

Located near the Atlantic Ocean, Rhode Island has one of the most moderate climates of the U.S. northeast."
"Tennessee wine refers to wine made from grapes grown in the U.S. state of Tennessee. The state was home to a wine industry in the 19th century that was greatly impacted when Prohibition was introduced in the early 20th century. The modern Tennessee wine industry focuses on French hybrid and native grapes, which are more resistant to the fungal grapevine diseases that thrive in Tennessee's humid climate. Most of the wineries in the state are located in Middle and East Tennessee. A small portion of the Mississippi Delta AVA, a designated American Viticultural Area extends into the southwestern part of the state."
"Texas has a long history of wine production. The sunny and dry climate of the major winemaking regions in the state have drawn comparison to Portuguese wines, in addition to other regions in Europe like Spain, France, and Italy. Some of the earliest recorded Texas wines were produced by Spanish missionaries in the 1650s near El Paso. Texas ranked as the fifth largest wine producing state by 2019. The state is home to over 42 members of the Vitis grape vine family with fifteen being native to the state, more than any other region on earth. As of 2017, the state had over 4,550 acres (1,840 ha) planted with Vitis vinifera. Despite being the largest of conterminous states, this relatively small amount of planted land is dwarfed by the production of even the smallest French AOCs like Sancerre. The Texan wine industry is continuing its steady pace of expansion and has gained a reputation as an established wine growing region in the United States."
"West Virginia wine refers to wine made from grapes grown in the U.S. state of West Virginia. West Virginia has 11 wineries located throughout the state, including three designated American Viticultural Areas.

"The Australian wine industry is one of the world's largest exporters of wine, with approximately 800 million out of the 1.2 to 1.3 billion litres produced annually exported to overseas markets. The wine industry is a significant contributor to the Australian economy through production, employment, export and tourism. There is a $3.5 billion domestic market for Australian wines, with Australians consuming approximately 500 million litres annually. Norfolk Islanders are the second biggest per capita wine consumers in the world with 54 litres. Only 16.6% of wine sold domestically is imported. Wine is produced in every state, with more than 60 designated wine regions totalling approximately 160,000 hectares; however Australia's wine regions are mainly in the southern, cooler parts of the country, with vineyards located in South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, Tasmania and Queensland. The wine regions in each of these states produce different wine varieties and styles that take advantage of the particular Terroir such as: climatic differences, topography and soil types. The major varieties are predominantly Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Merlot, Semillon, Pinot noir, Riesling, and Sauvignon blanc. Wines are often labelled with the name of their grape variety, which must constitute at least 85 percent of the wine."

"The Sopron–Kőszeg railway line, also known as Burgerlandbahn, is a railway line formerly connecting Sopron and Kőszeg, two towns in western Hungary, through Burgenland. It is a single-track partly electrified line, operated by ÖBB (passenger trains) and GySEV (goods trains). Its only connection to the rest of the ÖBB network currently is through Sopron. Operations on most of the track (between Deutschkreutz and Kőszeg) have been ceased in a few stages. As the Iron Curtain has cut off Hungary from Austria, passenger traffic between Rattersdorf-Liebing and Kőszeg had to be stopped on 6 October 1951, with goods trains no longer operating since 1 September 1960 on, with only corridor traffic being allowed.

"Bermet (Бермет in Serbian Cyrillic) is a dessert wine that is a specialty of northern Serbia's Fruška Gora wine region, in the Vojvodina province. It was originally intended for medicinal purposes (similar to the original digestifs), but later it was produced for regular consumption. It contains between 16 and 18% of alcohol and it is usually served as a dessert wine, but can also be served as an aperitif, much like Vermouth. However, Bermet is produced in a different manner than Vermouth, through maceration of 20 different herbs and spices. It can be made of red or white grapes, but the exact recipe is secret and held by only a handful of families in the town of Sremski Karlovci. According to some documents, Bermet was served on the Titanic, as well as in the Vienna royal palace. It is best served at a temperature of 18-20 C. Bermet is registered as a protected indication of geographical origin in the Intellectual Property Office of the Republic of Serbia."
"Red wine is a type of wine made from dark-colored grape varieties. The actual color of the wine can range from intense violet, typical of young wines, through to brick red for mature wines and brown for older red wines. The juice from most purple grapes is greenish-white, the red color coming from anthocyan pigments (also called anthocyanins) present in the skin of the grape; exceptions are the relatively uncommon teinturier varieties, which produce a red-colored juice. Much of the red-wine production process therefore involves extraction of color and flavor components from the grape skin. Red wine is a delicacy around the world."
"White wine is a wine that is fermented without skin contact. The colour can be straw-yellow, yellow-green, or yellow-gold. It is produced by the alcoholic fermentation of the non-coloured pulp of grapes, which may have a skin of any colour. White wine has existed for at least 4000 years. The wide variety of white wines comes from the large number of varieties, methods of winemaking, and ratios of residual sugar. White wine is mainly from ""white"" grapes, which are green or yellow in colour, such as the Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc, and Riesling. Some white wine is also made from grapes with coloured skin, provided that the obtained wort is not stained. Pinot noir, for example, is commonly used to produce champagne. Among the many types of white wine, dry white wine is the most common. More or less aromatic and tangy, it is derived from the complete fermentation of the wort. Sweet wines, on the other hand, are produced by interrupting the fermentation before all the grape sugars are converted into alcohol; this is called Mutage or fortification. The methods of enriching wort with sugar are multiple: on-ripening on the vine, passerillage (straining), or the use of noble rot. Sparkling wines, which are mostly white, are wines where the carbon dioxide from the fermentation is kept dissolved in the wine and becomes gas when the bottle is opened. White wines are often used as an apéritif before a meal, with dessert, or as a refreshing drink between meals. White wines are often considered more refreshing, and lighter in both style and taste than the majority of their red wine counterparts. In addition, due to their acidity, aroma, and ability to soften meat and deglaze cooking juices, white wines are often used in cooking."
"Wine is an alcoholic drink typically made from fermented grapes. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol, carbon dioxide and heat. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts are major factors in different styles of wine. These differences result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the grape's growing environment (terroir), and the wine production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production. Wines not made from grapes involve fermentation of additional crops, including rice wine and other fruit wines such as plum, cherry, pomegranate, currant and elderberry. Wine has been produced for thousands of years. The earliest evidence of wine is from ancient China (c. 7000 BC), Georgia (6000 BC), Persia (5000 BC), and Italy (4000 BC). New World wine has some connection to alcoholic beverages made by the indigenous peoples of the Americas, but is mainly connected to later Viking area of Vinland and Spanish traditions in New Spain. Later, as Old World wine further developed viticulture techniques, Europe would encompass three of the largest wine-producing regions. Today, the five countries with the largest wine-producing regions are in Italy, Spain, France, the United States, and China. Wine has long played an important role in religion. Red wine was associated with blood by the ancient Egyptians and was used by both the Greek cult of Dionysus and the Romans in their Bacchanalia; Judaism also incorporates it in the Kiddush, and Christianity in the Eucharist. Egyptian, Greek, Roman, and Israeli wine cultures are still connected to these ancient roots. Similarly the largest wine regions in Italy, Spain, and France have heritages in connection to sacramental wine, likewise, viticulture traditions in the Southwestern United States started within New Spain as Catholic friars and monks first produced wines in New Mexico and California."
"A winery is a building or property that produces wine, or a business involved in the production of wine, such as a wine company. Some wine companies own many wineries. Besides wine making equipment, larger wineries may also feature warehouses, bottling lines, laboratories, and large expanses of tanks known as tank farms. Wineries may have existed as long as 8,000 years ago."

"Fragolino is an Italian red wine produced in Veneto with grape, or uva fragola (literally, ""strawberry-grape""). This kind of grape does not belong to the Vitis vinifera family, but to the , and it was introduced to fight a plague of a parasite named phylloxera, which was destroying the European grapevine and wine production. This American grapevine was more resistant to the parasites. Venetian winemakers had the idea to make wine directly with this new grape, and this wine was delicious. Sweet and refreshing, the fragolino is a summer wine, with a delicate aftertaste of strawberry. Fragolino, as fragola means strawberry. Moreover, it was inexpensive and became popular around the Venetian area, where it was produced. However, Fragolino is considered a very low quality wine among connoisseursToday, it is almost impossible to find the real fragolino because its commerce was banned by the EU and the Italian government. Many stories have been told about the fragolino ban. The more official one is that it was banned because it is difficult to control methanol levels during wine production and methanol can be poisonous. Some science revisionists argue that the Vitis labrusca was actually responsible, due to its resistance, to the spread of the phylloxera plague in Europe, and it was banned for this reason: but this confusing version of the story ignores the historical fact of its importation in Europe, France first, was made in the 19th century for the exact opposite reason, when the phylloxera was already destroying the Vitis vinifera cultivations."
"Mustang wine is a type of red wine made with mustang grapes, Vitis mustangensis, in Texas."
"The United Kingdom is a major consumer but only a very minor producer of wine, with English and Welsh wine sales combined accounting for just 1% of the domestic market. Wine production in the UK has historically been perceived as less than ideal due to the cold climate. The current market, however, is growing. Recent warmer summers have played a role in increasing investment and sale of wines. Most of the wine produced is of a white and sparkling variety, with the majority of vineyards in existence across Southern England and Wales where the climate is warmer than that of northern areas. Vineyards are becoming more commonplace in counties such as Essex, Sussex and Kent, where more varieties of wine can be produced due to the drier and warmer climate."
"Nova Scotia wine is Canadian wine produced in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia.

It lies within the North Coast AVA and takes its name from the nearby Eagle Peak summit covering the mountainous area situated in the California Coastal Range just west of the Redwood Valley AVA and east of the V-shaped Mendocino AVA. It was first proposed in June 2013, designating roughly 26,260 acres (10,627 ha) and straddles U.S. Highway 101 between the towns of Ukiah and Willits. The new boundaries reduced about 1,500 and 1,900 acres (607 and 769 ha) from each bordering AVA to eliminate overlap with Eagle Peak Mendocino County."
"Pauillac ([po.jak]) is a wine growing commune (municipality) and appellation d'origine contrôlée within Haut-Médoc in Bordeaux, centred on the small town of Pauillac.

"Pomerol is a French wine-growing commune and Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) within the Libournais (""Right Bank"") in Bordeaux. The wine produced here is predominately from Merlot with Cabernet Franc playing a supporting role. Unlike most other Bordeaux communes, there is no real village of Pomerol, although there is a church. The houses are set among the vineyards. The region was recognized as a distinct wine region apart from Saint-Émilion and the greater Libournais region by the French government in 1923 and was granted AOC status in 1936 as part of the first wave of AOC establishments by the Institut national de l'origine et de la qualité (INAO). While it is now one of the most prestigious of the Bordeaux AOCs, this situation is relatively recent, dating to the second half of the twentieth century, which is often given as one of the reasons why Pomerol is not included in any of the Bordeaux classifications. Pomerol is the smallest of the major fine wine regions in Bordeaux, covering an area that is roughly three kilometers wide by 4 kilometers long. It is roughly one-seventh of the size of its much larger Right Bank neighbor Saint-Émilion AOC and is on par with the smallest Left Bank commune of Saint-Julien AOC in the Médoc. In 1998, there were 784 hectares of grape vines planted within the AOC boundaries producing 36,066 hectoliters (≈ 952,763 gallons or 400,733 cases) of wine. In 2003 there were 150 declared producers in Pomerol harvesting 780 ha and producing a year average of 32,250 hl (around 358,333 cases) of wine. Almost all the wine is estate-bottled. Unlike other French wine regions, such as Burgundy and the Rhône Valley, there are no co-operatives currently operating in Pomerol. By 2007, the number of planted hectares had risen slightly to 800 ha (1980 acres). In 2009, there were 140 declared producers in Pomerol, have an average surface area of six hectares and the vineyard of the ""Pomerol"" appellation covers 800 hectares for an average production of 35,000 hectoliters per year. While many Pomerol wines now fetch very high prices at wine auctions and in the private market on a par with the most highly rated classified growths of Bordeaux, there is no official classification of Pomerol wine. However, the region does contain one property widely held to be equivalent to premier cru: Château Pétrus."
"A varietal wine is a wine made primarily from a single named grape variety, and which typically displays the name of that variety on the wine label. Examples of grape varieties commonly used in varietal wines are Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay and Merlot. Wines that display the name of two or more varieties on their label, such as a Chardonnay-Viognier, are blends and not varietal wines. The term is frequently misused in place of vine variety; the term variety refers to the vine or grape while varietal refers to the wine produced by a variety. As vintners and consumers have become aware of the characteristics of individual varieties of wine grapes, wines have also come to be identified by varietal names. The term was popularized in the US by Maynard Amerine at the University of California, Davis after Prohibition seeking to encourage growers to choose optimal vine varieties, and later promoted by Frank Schoonmaker in the 1950s and 1960s, ultimately becoming widespread during the California wine boom of the 1970s. Varietal wines are commonly associated with New World wines in general, but there is also a long-standing tradition of varietal labelling in Germany and other German-influenced wine regions including Austria, Alsace, and the Czech Republic."
"Sparkling wine is a wine with significant levels of carbon dioxide in it, making it fizzy. While the phrase commonly refers to champagne, EU countries legally reserve that term for products exclusively produced in the Champagne region of France. Sparkling wine is usually either white or rosé, but there are examples of red sparkling wines such as the Italian Brachetto, Bonarda and Lambrusco, and the Australian sparkling Shiraz. The sweetness of sparkling wine can range from very dry brut styles to sweeter doux varieties (French for 'hard' and 'soft', respectively). The sparkling quality of these wines comes from its carbon dioxide content and may be the result of natural fermentation, either in a bottle, as with the traditional method, in a large tank designed to withstand the pressures involved (as in the Charmat process), or as a result of simple carbon dioxide injection in some cheaper sparkling wines. In EU countries, the word ""champagne"" is reserved by law only for sparkling wine from the Champagne region of France. The French terms Mousseux and Crémant refer to sparkling wine not made in the Champagne region, such as Blanquette de Limoux produced in Southern France. Sparkling wines are produced around the world, and are often referred to by their local name or region, such as Prosecco, Franciacorta, Trento DOC, Oltrepò Pavese Metodo Classico and Asti from Italy (the generic Italian term for sparkling wine being ), Espumante from Portugal, Cava from Spain, and Cap Classique from South Africa. Sparkling wines have been produced in Central and Eastern Europe since the early 19th-century. ""Champagne"" was further popularised in the region, late in the century, when József Törley started production in Hungary using French methods, learned as an apprentice in Reims. Törley has since become one of the largest European producers of sparkling wine. The United States is a significant producer of sparkling wine today, with producers in numerous states. Recently, production of sparkling wine has restarted in the United Kingdom after a long hiatus."
"Vino cotto (literally 'cooked wine’, also vi'cotto or vi'cuotte), is a type of wine from the Marche and Abruzzo in Central Italy, made primarily in the hills of the Province of Ascoli Piceno and the Province of Macerata. It is a strong ruby-colored wine, usually semi-sweet, and traditionally drunk in small glasses with puddings and cheese. It is produced from the must of any of the local varieties of grapes, heated in a copper vessel until reduced to a half or third of its original volume, and then fermented. It can be aged for years, barrels being topped up with each harvest. It is mostly made by private individuals for their own use as, under EU rules, it cannot be sold as wine. A few wineries produce and sell it commercially as a foodstuff. This vino cotto should not be confused with the naturally sweet syrup obtained by cooking the grape must, not fermenting it. Although southern Italian regions such as Calabria call the syrup vino cotto or vincotto, the Marche regions and Puglia/Apulia call it sapa. It's known throughout the Mediterranean by various other names as well."
"Kazakh wine is wine made in Kazakhstan. The roots of the Kazakh wine industry can be traced to the 7th century AD when grapevines were brought to the region from neighboring Uzbekistan and China. While only around 4% of the land in Kazakhstan is ideally situated for viticulture, the country does manage to produce over 6.2 million gallons (236,000 hl) of wine annually from 32,120 acres (13,000 ha). Buoyed by its mineral wealth, the country is an enthusiastic consumer of wine but must import 80% of the 30 m bottles it drinks."
"Slovenian wine is wine from Slovenia. Viticulture and winemaking has existed in this region since the time of the Celts and Illyrians tribes, long before the Romans would introduce winemaking to the lands of France, Spain and Germany. Today Slovenia has more than 28,000 wineries making between 80 and 90 million litres annually from the country's 22,300 ha of vineyards. About 75% of the country's production is white wine. Almost all of the wine is consumed domestically with only 6.1 million L a year being exported—mostly to the United States, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and lately the Czech Republic. Most of the country's wine production falls under the classification of premium (vrhunsko) wine with less than 30% classified as basic table wine (namizno vino). Slovenia has three principal wine regions: the , the , and the . In 2016, a research study based on DNA profiling and historical ampelographic sources showed that two international varieties of red grape, the Blaufränkisch and the Blauer Portugieser, likely originate from the Styria region of modern Slovenia."
"Turkish wine is wine made in the transcontinental Eurasian country Turkey. The Caucasus region, where Georgia and Iran are located, played a pivotal role in the early history of wine and is likely to have been one of the earliest wine-producing regions of the world. Ampelographers estimate that Turkey is home to between 600 and 1200 indigenous varieties of Vitis vinifera (the European grapevine), though less than 60 of these are grown commercially. With over 8,120 square kilometres (2,010,000 acres) planted under vine, Turkey is the world's fourth-leading producer of grapes for wine production. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, Turkey's first president, established the country's first commercial winery in 1925. According to the OIV, the total wine production in 2005 was 287,000 hl. In the first half of 2009, wine consumption in Turkey reached 20,906,762 litres."
"Algerian wine is wine made in Algeria. While not a significant force on the world's wine market today, Algeria has played an important role in the history of wine. Algeria's viticultural history dates back to its settlement by the Phoenicians and continued under Algeria's rule by the Roman empire. Just prior to the Algerian War of Independence (1954-1962), Algerian wine (along with the production of Morocco and Tunisia) accounted for nearly two-thirds of the total international wine trade. With as much land under vine as the countries of Germany and South Africa, Algeria continues to maintain a wine industry with over 70 wineries in operation."
"Chilean wine has a long history for a New World wine region, as it was the 16th century when the Spanish conquistadors brought Vitis vinifera vines with them as they colonized the region. In the mid-19th century, French wine varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Carmenère and Franc were introduced. In the early 1980s, a renaissance began with the introduction of stainless steel fermentation tanks and the use of oak barrels for aging. Wine exports grew very quickly as quality wine production increased. The number of wineries grew from 12 in 1995 to over 70 in 2005. A large number of French people immigrated to Chile during the late 20th century, bringing more vinicultural knowledge to the country. Chile is now the fifth largest exporter of wines in the world, and the seventh largest producer. The climate has been described as midway between that of California and France. The most common grapes are Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Carmenère. So far Chile has remained free of the phylloxera louse, which means that the country's grapevines do not need to be grafted with phylloxera-resistant rootstocks."
"Clairet (French: [klɛ.ʁɛ]) is a wine that is dark pink in style and may be described as a full-bodied and deep-coloured type of rosé. It is considered a specialty of the Bordeaux region and is thought to have originated in Quinsac in Premieres Côtes de Bordeaux.Similar to the light wine of the Middle Ages that was exported to England, also called ""vinum clarum"" and ""vin clar"" or ""bin clar"", the name is the source of the English term claret, although that term does not refer to a clairet but to a red wine. The wine is bottled under the AOC of Bordeaux clairet."
"German wine is primarily produced in the west of Germany, along the river Rhine and its tributaries, with the oldest plantations going back to the Roman era. Approximately 60 percent of German wine is produced in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, where 6 of the 13 regions (Anbaugebiete) for quality wine are situated. Germany has about 103,000 hectares (252,000 acres or 1,030 square kilometers) of vineyard, which is around one tenth of the vineyard surface in Spain, France or Italy. The total wine production is usually around 10 million hectoliters annually, corresponding to 1.3 billion bottles, which places Germany as the eighth-largest wine-producing country in the world. White wine accounts for almost two thirds of the total production. As a wine country, Germany has a mixed reputation internationally, with some consumers on the export markets associating Germany with the world's most elegant and aromatically pure white wines while other see the country mainly as the source of cheap, mass-market semi-sweet wines such as Liebfraumilch. Among enthusiasts, Germany's reputation is primarily based on wines made from the Riesling grape variety, which at its best is used for aromatic, fruity and elegant white wines that range from very crisp and dry to well-balanced, sweet and of enormous aromatic concentration. While primarily a white wine country, red wine production surged in the 1990s and early 2000s, primarily fuelled by domestic demand, and the proportion of the German vineyards devoted to the cultivation of dark-skinned grape varieties has now stabilized at slightly more than a third of the total surface. For the red wines, Spätburgunder, the domestic name for Pinot noir, is in the lead."
Uva di Puglia PGI is a variety of grape grown in the southern Italian region of Apulia (Puglia).
"Solera is a process for aging liquids such as wine, beer, vinegar, and brandy, by fractional blending in such a way that the finished product is a mixture of ages, with the average age gradually increasing as the process continues over many years. The purpose of this labor-intensive process is the maintenance of a reliable style and quality of the beverage over time. Solera means ""on the ground"" in Spanish, and it refers to the lower level of the set of barrels or other containers used in the process; the liquid is traditionally transferred from barrel to barrel, top to bottom, the oldest mixtures being in the barrel right ""on the ground"", although the containers in today's process are not necessarily stacked physically in the way that this implies but merely carefully labeled. Products which are often solera aged include Sherry, Madeira, Lillet, Port wine, Marsala, Mavrodafni, Muscat, and Muscadelle wines; Balsamic, Commandaria, some Vins doux naturels, and Sherry vinegars; Brandy de Jerez; beer; rums; and whiskies. Since the origin of this process is out of the Iberian peninsula, most of the traditional terminology is in Spanish and Portuguese."
"Vitis rotundifolia, or muscadine, is a grapevine species native to the southeastern and south-central United States. The growth range extends from Florida to New Jersey coast, and west to eastern Texas and Oklahoma. It has been extensively cultivated since the 16th century. The plants are well-adapted to their native warm and humid climate; they need fewer chilling hours than better known varieties, and thrive in summer heat. Muscadine berries may be bronze or dark purple or black when ripe. Wild varieties may stay green through maturity. Muscadines are typically used in making artisan wines, juice, and jelly. They are rich sources of polyphenols. In a natural setting, muscadine provides wildlife habitat as shelter, browse, and food for many birds and animals. It is also a larval host for the Nessus Sphinx Moth (Amphion floridensis) and the Mournful Sphinx Moth (Enyo lugubris)."
"Enoteca (plural: Enoteche) is an Italian word that is derived from the Greek word Οινοθήκη, which literally means ""wine repository"" (from Oeno/Eno- Οινός ""wine"", and teca Θήκη, ""receptacle, case, box""), but it is used to describe a special type of local or regional wine shop that originated in Italy. The concept of an enoteca has also spread to some other countries. A genuine enoteca is primarily directed at giving visitors or tourists the possibility to taste these wines at a reasonable price and possibly to buy them. An enoteca is often run in collaboration with growers or growers' or tourism organisations in the village or region. The reason such establishments were named to connote ”wine libraries” was that they were intended as a hands-on source of information on local wines rather than as regular outlets for larger quantities of each wine, or primarily intended for established customers. Often, an enoteca stocks rather small amounts of each wine, and customers who wish to purchase large quantities after tasting are referred directly to the producers. In some cases, an enoteca will also sell other local foodstuff and/or serve small snacks to go with the wines. A long-standing tradition that precedes the new coinage, is the wine shop in Palazzo Antinori, Florence, where Antinori wines have been available by the glass for more than a century. Enoteche have spread north of the Alps to Austria under the German name Vinothek and from Austria to Germany. Being associated with an enoteca is likely more beneficial to smaller, not too well-known producers than to large or well-established ones. Casual visitors will have an easier time discovering an enoteca, and the producer will not have to keep an outlet open in his winery just in case someone passes by to purchase a few bottles. On the other hand, having many wines are available side-by-side for tasting, comparison and competition, will be better for well-performing wineries."
"North Macedonia produces wine on some 22,400 hectares (55,000 acres) of vineyards, and the production was 108,100 tonnes in 2008. There are also some additional 30,000 hectares (74,000 acres) of vineyards dedicated to table grapes. Red wine dominates the Macedonian wine production, with around 80 per cent. In contrast, within the European Union, ""Macedonia"" is a protected geographical indication (PGI) for wines produced in the Greek viticulture region of Macedonia."

This happened due to the desire to, among other things, secure the border with Austria."
"Tokaj wine region (Slovak: Vinohradnícka oblasť Tokaj) is a wine-growing region located in south-eastern Slovakia and north-eastern Hungary. The two vine-growing areas were once part of greater Tokaj wine region (also Tokaj-Hegyalja wine region or Tokaj-Hegyalja) of the Kingdom of Hungary. Following the Treaty of Trianon a smaller part (3 villages and about 175 hectares of vineyards) became part of Czechoslovakia, and after 1993 Slovakia. The majority of the region (around 28 communities and some 5,500 hectares of vineyards) remained part of Hungary. Nowadays, the Slovak part of Tokaj wine region comprises 7 communities and approximately 908 hectares of vineyards. Under current EU legislation, the vintners in the Slovak wine region of Tokaj may use the Tokaj label (or Tokajský/-á/-é which means “of Tokaj” in Slovak)."

"The Hawke's Bay wine region is New Zealand's oldest and second-largest wine-production region, on the east coast of the North Island. Production reached 41,000 tonnes in 2018 from 4,681 hectares (11,570 acres) of planted vines, representing 10.2% of total national production. Although some of the oldest wineries still operating in New Zealand, including Te Mata Estate, Church Road, and Mission Estate, were established in the Hawke's Bay area in the late 19th century, it was only established as a geographical indication (GI) in 2018. The GI protects any wine produced within the boundaries of the entire Hawke's Bay Region, but in practice the vineyards are chiefly concentrated in the plains and low hills surrounding the cities of Napier and Hastings."
"New Zealand wine is produced in several of its distinct winegrowing regions. As an island country in the South Pacific Ocean, New Zealand has a largely maritime climate, although its elongated geography produces considerable regional variation from north to south. Like many other New World wines, New Zealand wine is usually produced and labelled as single varietal wines, or if blended, winemakers list the varietal components on the label. New Zealand is best known for its Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, and more recently its dense, concentrated Pinot Noir from Marlborough, Martinborough and Central Otago. While New Zealand wine traces its history to the early 19th century, the modern wine industry in New Zealand began in the mid-20th century and expanded rapidly in the early 21st century, growing by 17% a year from 2000 to 2020. In 2020, New Zealand produced 329 million litres (87,000,000 US gal) from 39,935 hectares (98,680 acres) of vineyard area, of which 25,160 ha (about two-thirds) is dedicated to Sauvignon Blanc.

"Big Valley District-Lake County AVA is an American Viticultural Area located in Lake County, California. There was 6 wineries within the viticultural area, as well as 43 commercially-producing vineyards covering approximately 1,800 acres (728 ha) when officially established by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) in October 2013 alongside the adjacent Kelsey Bench AVA. Big Valley District is in a large valley near Clear Lake, the Mayacamas mountain range, and the dormant Mount Konocti volcano. The AVA is in the less hilly area near Kelseyville; the hillier areas are part of the . Big Valley is a structural basin that is part of the larger Clear Lake basin. Sauvignon Blanc grape variety makes up the majority of the region's plantings in addition to producing Zinfandels and Cabernet Francs."
"Kelsey Bench-Lake County AVA is an American Viticultural Area located in Lake County, California. The area is home to some 900 acres (364 hectares) of vines in 27 vineyards, and was officially established as an AVA by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) in October 2013. Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Viognier and Riesling are the principal white grape varieties within Kelsey Bench and its neighbor the Big Valley District AVA. The Zinfandel, Merlot and Cabernet Franc varieties make up the majority of red grape plantings in the area. The name “Kelsey Bench” is a combination of “Kelsey,” the surname of several early settlers in the area, and “bench,” a term used to describe the terraces that rise above the lower elevations of the valley to the north. The AVA boundaries cover a series of tectonically-uplifted terraces in the southern half of a valley on the banks of Clear Lake. The Mayacamas mountains in the south and west separate the area from the southern end of Mendocino County, and the dormant Mount Konocti volcano lies to the east. The Red Hills Lake County AVA is on the south-eastern border of Kelsey Bench and when the appellation was formalized, the Red Hills boundaries were modified slightly to meet the Kelsey Bench boundaries. Kelsey Bench shares both the valley and the TTB's AVA ruling with the Big Valley District AVA to the north. The region's growers submitted the two petitions together, drawing a line between the valley floor and the higher elevations in the south. The higher elevations of Kelsey Bench mean that the climate here is warmer than in Big Valley District, although not so warm as Red Hills Lake County in the east. Cold air from the mountains drains off the benches into the valley below, extending the growing season by lessening the risk of frost in the early spring and fall. Vines are stressed by the strong winds that buffet the area, and photosynthesis, therefore ripening, is slowed as a result. This gives the grapes ample time to develop rich fruit complexity alongside vital acidity, leading to well-balanced wines. Kelsey Bench has predominantly rich, red, volcanic soils. Rosa d'Oro is the only winery located within the boundaries of the AVA."
"Lamorinda AVA is an American Viticultural Area in the San Francisco Bay Area located due east of the Berkeley Hills in Contra Costa County encompassing the region around the cities of Lafayette, Moraga and Orinda.

The AVA is a sub-region within the existing San Francisco Bay AVA and the larger, multicounty Central Coast AVA stretching approximately 30,000 acres (47 sq mi) with 46 commercially-producing vineyards that cover approximately 139 acres (56 ha). The USDA plant hardiness zone for the AVA is 9b. The AVA was proposed as the growers in the area found the wider San Francisco Bay and Central Coast AVA titles too generic and not indicative of its terroir. The Lamorinda AVA was officially established in February 2016 by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB)."
"Moon Mountain District Sonoma County is an American Viticultural Area (AVA) within Sonoma Valley and North Coast viticultural areas, just north of the city of Sonoma. This mountainous region on the very eastern edge of Sonoma County has a historic reputation for producing rich, intensely-flavored wines from Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah varietals since the 1880s. The District was established on November 1, 2013 by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB). Its designation covers 17,663 acres (28 sq mi) of land stretching north-south along the western slopes of the Mayacamas mountains between Sugarloaf Ridge State Park and Los Carneros viticultural area with the Napa Valley’s Mount Veeder viticultural area outlining the eastern slopes.

The AVA lies entirely within the North Coast AVA and partially in the Sonoma Coast AVA with eighty commercially-producing vineyards cultivating 4,000 acres (1,619 ha) and nine bonded wineries. The wind gap in its coastal mountain range funnels cooling breezes and fog east from the Pacific Ocean through the city of Petaluma to San Pablo Bay. A persistent afternoon breeze causes lower grape yields and longer hang time contributes to the AVA vintages' unique flavors and fruit characteristics which defines their character and distinction."
"Squaw Valley-Miramonte is an American Viticultural Area (AVA) and a unique grape-growing region in Fresno County, California surrounding the towns of Squaw Valley and Miramonte approximately 40 miles (64 km) east of the city of Fresno.

First Growth (French: Premier Cru) status is a classification of wines primarily from the Bordeaux region of France.
"The Liv-ex Bordeaux Classification was created in 2009 by the London International Vintners Exchange, the global marketplace for the wine trade. The classification of 2009 was inspired by the historical Bordeaux Classification and ranked the wines of the Bordeaux Left Bank solely on the price that each wine was worth at the time. Since then, the classification has expanded to reflect the changing conditions of the market for fine wine, and has been updated in 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2017.

"Port wine (also known as vinho do Porto, Portuguese pronunciation: [ˌviɲu duˈpoɾtu], or simply port) is a Portuguese fortified wine produced in the Douro Valley of northern Portugal. It is typically a sweet red wine, often served as a dessert wine, although it also comes in dry, semi-dry, and white varieties.

"French wine is produced all throughout France, in quantities between 50 and 60 million hectolitres per year, or 7–8 billion bottles. France is one of the largest wine producers in the world, along with Italian, Spanish, and American wine-producing regions. French wine traces its history to the 6th century BC, with many of France's regions dating their wine-making history to Roman times. The wines produced range from expensive wines sold internationally to modest wines usually only seen within France such as the Margnat wines were during the post war period. Two concepts central to the better French wines are the notion of terroir, which links the style of the wines to the locations where the grapes are grown and the wine is made, and the Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) system, replaced by the Appellation d'Origine Protégée (AOP) system in 2012. Appellation rules closely define which grape varieties and winemaking practices are approved for classification in each of France's several hundred geographically defined appellations, which can cover regions, villages or vineyards. France is the source of many grape varieties (such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Sauvignon blanc, Syrah) that are now planted throughout the world, as well as wine-making practices and styles of wine that have been adopted in other producing countries. Although some producers have benefited in recent years from rising prices and increased demand for some of the prestige wines from Burgundy and Bordeaux, the French wine industry has seen a decline in domestic consumption and internationally, it has had to compete with many New World wines."
"Canadian wine is wine produced in Canada. Ontario and British Columbia are the two largest wine-producing provinces in Canada, with two-thirds of the Canada's vineyard acreage situated in Ontario. However, wine producing regions are also present in other provinces, including Alberta, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. In 2015, Canada produced 56.2 million litres of wine, with 62 per cent of that total originating from Ontario. The second largest wine-producing province, British Columbia, constitutes 33 per cent of Canada's wine production. Between 2006 and 2011, 68 per cent of Canadian wine exports came from Ontario-based wineries; with 14 per cent of exports originating from British Columbia, 12 per cent from Quebec, and six per cent from Alberta. Icewine can be produced reliably in most Canadian wine-producing regions. As a result, Canada is the world's leading icewine producer, with more icewine produced in Canada than all other countries combined. More than 90 per cent of Canadian icewines originates from Ontario, although the product is also produced in British Columbia, Quebec, and Nova Scotia. In addition to standard grape wines, and icewines, the country is also home to several fruit wineries and meaderies, found in provinces such as in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, provinces whose local climate is not favourable for grape production."

"Red Willow Vineyard is a grape-growing estate located in the far western end of Yakima Valley AVA, within the Yakama Indian Reservation. Beginning with their relationship with Columbia Winery and Master of Wine David Lake, grapes from Red Willow have been used to produce some of the most critically acclaimed Washington wines with the vineyard's name regularly being featured on vineyard designated wines. Paul Gregutt, wine writer for the Seattle Times and Wine Enthusiast, list Red Willow as one of the ""top ten"" vineyards in the entire state. First planted in the 1920s to potatoes and alfalfa by the Stephenson family, Red Willow switched to viticulture in the 1970s when Mike Sauer married into the family and planted 30 acres of Concord. With the urging of Dr. Walter Clore of Washington State University, Sauer began planting experimental blocks of Vitis vinifera. In 1973, Sauer planted 3 acres of Cabernet Sauvignon which, after in the lower Rattlesnake Hills and in the Snipes Mountain AVA, is one of the oldest plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon still being used for wine production. From the WSU experimental plantings also came Washington's first commercial planting of Cabernet Franc and through a 30+ year relationship with David Lake and Columbia Winery, Red Willow would pioneer the plantings of many new varieties including Barbera, Malbec, Mourvedre, Nebbiolo, Sangiovese, Tempranillo and Viognier."

This AOC may be used for red and rosé wines with Pinot noir as the main grape variety, as well as white wines with Chardonnay as the main grape variety, and was created in 1961. The AOC extends into two departments: 
* In the Côte-d'Or department: 12 communes situated above the escarpment (the actual Hautes Côtes), and the top parts of 10 communes that are mainly situated in Côte de Beaune. 
* In the Saône-et-Loire department: four communes situated above the escarpment, and the top parts of three communes that are mainly situated in Côte de Beaune. The border between Hautes-Côtes de Beaune and Hautes-Côtes de Nuits to the north passes through Magny-lès-Villers."
"Hautes-Côtes de Nuits is a subregion of the Burgundy wine region located to the west of the Côte de Nuits subregion. While Côte de Nuits consists of vineyards located on or close to the main Côte d'Or escarpment, Hautes-Côtes de Nuits covers the area on top of the escarpment, and the adjacent area of various valleys and slopes. Only one appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC), Bourgogne Hautes-Côtes de Nuits, covers the entire subregion; there are no specific AOCs named after villages in this subregion, and also no Premier Cru vineyards. This AOC may be used for red and rosé wines with Pinot noir as the main grape variety, as well as white wines with Chardonnay as the main grape variety, and was created in 1961. The AOC covers a number of communes in the Côte-d'Or department: 16 communes situated above the escarpment (the actual Hautes Côtes), and the top parts of four communes that are mainly situated in Côte de Nuits. The border between Hautes-Côtes de Nuits and Hautes-Côtes de Beaune to the south passes through Magny-lès-Villers."
"Cinque Terre is a small DOC white wine region in Liguria, North Italy. The DOC was granted in 1973 and production is limited to the coastal areas of the Cinque Terre in the Province of La Spezia, and specifically to the territories of the communes of Riomaggiore (including Manarola), Vernazza (which includes the village of Corniglia, whose wine has been known since Roman times) and Monterosso al Mare, together with two adjacent areas within the commune of La Spezia: Tramonti di Biassa and Tramonti di Campiglia. The wine is produced from a must containing at least 40% of the Bosco grape, but may also contain up to 40% of Albarola and/or Vermentino and up to 20% of other white-berried grapes approved and/or recommended for the Province of La Spezia. The wines tend to be dry, with straw yellow colour, and a delicate aroma."
"Cagnina di Romagna was an Italian wine-producing zone in Emilia-Romagna region, in northeastern Italy. In 2011 it was incorporated into the Romagna Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) alongside the denominations of Pagadebit di Romagna, Romagna Albana Spumante, Sangiovese di Romagna, and Trebbiano di Romagna. The local name of the Terrano, a grape of the Refosco family, is Cagnina. The term can still be found on wine labels from Romagna DOC provided a minimum of 85% of Terrano/Cagnina is used in the wine. It makes a purple and red, fruit-scented, soft, slightly sweet red wine that is low in alcohol, low in acidity, and easy to sip. Cagnina di Romagna is often served with Ciambella and roast chestnuts."
"IGP Charentais, formerly known as vin de pays charentais up until 2009, is a French wine region and protected geographical indication (indication géographique protégée). It covers the French départements of Charente and Charente-Maritime in south-west France."
"The Überetsch (German: Überetsch; Italian: Oltradige) is a hilly section of the Etschtal in South Tyrol, northern Italy. It lies south-west of Bolzano and is a known tourist destination, famous for its wines, castles and lakes (Kalterer See, Montiggler Seen). The municipalities of the Überetsch are Kaltern and Eppan."
"Georgia is one of the oldest wine regions in the world. The fertile valleys and protective slopes of the Transcaucasia were home to grapevine cultivation and neolithic wine production (Georgian: ღვინო, ɣvino) for at least 8000 years. Due to the many millennia of wine in Georgian history and its prominent economic role, the traditions of wine are considered entwined with and inseparable from the national identity. Among the best-known Georgian wine regions are Kakheti (further divided into the micro-regions of Telavi and Kvareli), Kartli, Imereti, Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti, Adjara and Abkhazia. In 2013, UNESCO added the ancient traditional Georgian winemaking method using the Kvevri clay jars to the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists."
"Petzles is a hamlet in the village of Sankt Nikolai im Sausal in the district of Leibnitz in Styria, Austria. The hamlet has a population of 146 (2011).

There are visitors from Graz and further afield in the warmer months coming to sample wine and cold meats in the traditional Buschenschenke vineyard tavernas."
"The Petaluma Gap is a geographical region in Sonoma County, California which extends in a band from the Pacific Ocean to San Pablo Bay. It is an area of low land 22 to 31 miles (35 to 50 kilometers) wide in the coast ranges of the northern San Francisco Bay Area. The western edge of the gap is located in the coastal lowlands between Bodega Bay and Tomales Bay. The eastern edge of the gap is located at San Pablo Bay around the mouth of the Petaluma River. The city of Petaluma is near the center of the gap. The Petaluma Gap affects wind patterns (and thus microclimates and air quality) in the San Francisco Bay Area. Fresh marine air generally blows eastward through the gap, branching into southward and northward streams which blow toward the Carquinez Strait and Santa Rosa respectively. The southward stream brings marine air overland into the central Bay Area from the northwest. Warm air rises from the land and allows cold, moist air, plus winds and fog to move into the area."
"Crémant d'Alsace (French pronunciation: ​[kʁe.mɑ̃ dal.zas]) is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée for sparkling wines made in the Alsace wine region of France. Produced since 1900, the Crémant d'Alsace AOC was recognized in 1976 by the INAO and the designation Crémant regulated by the European Parliament in 1996. Crémant d'Alsace is usually made of some blend among pinot blanc, pinot gris, pinot noir, riesling, auxerrois and chardonnay. Crémant d'Alsace rosé, while rare, is made of pinot noir. The method of production is identical with that of champagne. In comparison to champagne, crémant d'Alsace is usually at a lower price levels; crémant d'Alsace cannot age in cellar as long as champagne (5 years maximum). In 2009, 31 million bottles were produced."
"Alsace Grand Cru is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée for wines made in specific parcels of the Alsace wine region of France. The Grand Cru AOC was recognized in 1975 by the INAO with subsequent expansion in 1983, 1992 and 2007. The wines come from selected sites in the Alsace AOC region, located at altitudes between 200 m and 300 m. To qualify for Grand Cru status, a wine must first meet the Alsace AOC rules and then other strict requirements. For example, the yield of the vineyards has to be 55 hectoliters per hectare or less, the wine has to come from a single named vineyard (called a lieu-dit in Alsace) of Grand Cru status, and the name of the vineyard must be on the label. As of 2018, 51 lieux-dits are listed as Grand Cru, the latest addition being Kaefferkopf of Ammerschwihr in January 2007."
"Lalande-de-Pomerol is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) for red wine situated in the Bordeaux wine region. The appellation is located on the right bank of the Garonne and Dordogne rivers.

"Côtes de Bourg is an Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) for Bordeaux wine situated around the small town of Bourg-sur-Gironde near Bordeaux, France. The first vineyards in the area were founded by the Romans. In the Middle Ages, Bourg was a major port for wine and the vineyards developed at the same tempo as the estuary traffic. The Côtes de Bourg appellation, in the north of the patchwork of Bordeaux wines, took its first steps on the east bank of the Gironde. At the time, the inhabitants of Bourg were fishermen, sailors or winemakers and the latter benefited from the perfect combination of a commercially minded town and a soil made for the vine."
"Saint-Émilion is an appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) for wine in the Bordeaux wine region of France, where it is situated in the Libourne subregion on the right bank of the Dordogne. Saint-Émilion is registered as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Its 5,400 hectares (13,000 acres) represent 67.5% of the total area of wine-producing communes (Saint-Émilion, Saint-Christophe-des-Bardes, Saint-Hippolyte, Saint-Étienne-de-Lisse, Saint-Laurent-des-Combes, Saint-Pey-d’Armens, Saint-Sulpice-de-Faleyrens, Vignonet, and a part of the Libourne commune) and 6% of the total Bordeaux vineyard. The wines of Saint-Émilion are typically blended from different grape varieties, the three main ones being Merlot (60% of the blend), Cabernet Franc (nearly 30%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (around 10%)."
"Pouilly-Vinzelles is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) for white wine in the Mâconnais subregion Burgundy in central France, located in the communes of Vinzelles and Loché, the latter an associated commune of Mâcon. Pouilly-Vinzelles has Chardonnay as the only allowed grape variety. There are no Premier Cru vineyards within the AOC, as the local growers at the time the regulations were being drawn up never applied for this. The AOC was created in 1940. Pouilly-Vinzelles is located adjacent to the appellation Pouilly-Fuissé, which is considerably larger than Pouilly-Vinzelles, and just south of Pouilly-Loché. These three neighbouring appellations all produce white wines of a similar style."
"Mazoyères-Chambertin is an Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) and Grand Cru vineyard for red wine in the Côte de Nuits subregion of Burgundy, with Pinot noir as the main grape variety. Mazoyères-Chambertin is located within the commune of Gevrey-Chambertin. It is situated below (to the east of) the Route des Grands Crus. It borders on Latricières-Chambertin and the Gevrey-Chambertin Premier Cru aux Combottes in the west, Charmes-Chambertin in the north, Gevrey-Chambertin village level vineyards in the east, and Morey-Saint-Denis Premier Cru vineyards in the south. The AOC was created in 1937. A peculiarity of Mazoyères-Chambertin is that the appellations Charmes-Chambertin (of the neighbouring Grand Cru vineyard) may be used interchangeably with that of Mazoyères-Chambertin. As Charmes-Chambertin is the more popular to use, relatively little wine is bottled as Mazoyères-Chambertin, which is only around 10 per cent of the production. Another grand cru vineyard in Gevrey Chambertin with a similar name, but no other connection is Mazis-Chambertin which is also known as Mazy-Chambertin."
"Saint-Bris is an Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) for white wine in the Burgundy wine region of France. This AOC is located around the village Saint-Bris-le-Vineux in the Yonne department, a few kilometers southwest of the Chablis AOC area, and southeast of the city of Auxerre, which places it roughly halfway between Paris and Burgundy's heartland in Côte d'Or. The approximately 100 hectares (250 acres) of vineyard in the appellation are situated in the communes Chitry, Irancy, Quenne, Saint-Bris-le-Vineux and Vincelottes. What makes Saint-Bris something of an oddity for Burgundy is that it is made from Sauvignon grapes, with the varieties Sauvignon blanc and Sauvignon gris both being allowed, rather than the Chardonnay of Chablis and the notable white Burgundies, or the Aligoté of many simpler, easy-drinking whites of the region. It is the only Burgundy AOC that allows Sauvignon in the wines. Wines from vineyards around Saint-Bris-le-Vineux planted with Chardonnay or Pinot noir are not included in the Saint-Bris AOC, but are allowed the appellation . While showing typical Sauvignon aromas, the wines have been characterised as less concentrated than the Sauvignon blanc-based AOC wines of the upper Loire valley, notably Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé."
"Viré-Clessé is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) for white wine in the Mâconnais subregion in Burgundy in central France, located in the communes of Clessé, Laizé, Montbellet and Viré. Viré-Clessé has Chardonnay as the only allowed grape variety. There are no Premier Cru vineyards within the AOC. The AOC was created in 1999, when this area was upgraded to be a communal-level appellation of its own (""a separate Mâconnais cru"" similar to e.g. Pouilly-Fuissé) rather than being part of the subregional Mâcon AOC, which covers a much larger area. Before the Viré-Clessé AOC was created, the wines could be labelled Mâcon-Vire or Mâcon-Clessé. The Viré-Clessé AOC is located in the northern part of the Mâconnais subregion, north of the town of Mâcon, in the direction of the Côte Chalonnaise subregion."
"Blagny is an appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) for red wine from Pinot noir produced in the communes of Meursault and Puligny-Montrachet in Côte de Beaune of Burgundy. The appellation only covers seven Premier Cru-classed climats in the two communes, and takes its name from a small village in Puligny-Montrachet situated just on the commune border to Meursault. The AOC was created in 1970. In 2008, there were 4.66 hectares (11.5 acres) of vineyard surface in production for Blagny AOC, and 164 hectoliter of wine was produced, corresponding to just under 22,000 bottles. The AOC regulations allow up to 15 per cent total of Chardonnay, Pinot blanc and Pinot gris as accessory grapes in the red wines, but this not very often practiced. The allowed base yield is 40 hectoliter per hectare and the grapes must reach a maturity of at least 10.5 per cent potential alcohol for village-level wine and 11.0 per cent Premier Cru wine. The seven climats of Blagny AOC are: 
* In Meursault: La Jeunelotte, La Pièce sous le Bois, Sous le Dos d’Ane, Sous Blagny. 
* In Puligny-Montrachet: Sous le Puits, La Garenne (or Sur la Garenne), Hameau de Blagny. White wines from these vineyards are entitled to the Meursault Premier Cru or Puligny-Montrachet Premier Cru designation, depending on in which commune they are situated, while red wines from these vineyards may only be designated Blagny Premier Cru. While all vineyards within Blagny are entitled to the Blagny Premier Cru designation, it is also possible to produce village-level Blagny."
"Pouilly-Loché is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) for white wine in the Mâconnais subregion Burgundy in central France, located in the commune of Loché, an associated commune of Mâcon. Pouilly-Loché has Chardonnay as the only allowed grape variety. There are no Premier Cru vineyards within the AOC, as the local growers at the time the regulations were being drawn up never applied for this. The AOC was created in 1940. Pouilly-Loché is located adjacent to the appellations Pouilly-Fuissé, which is considerably larger than Pouilly-Loché, and Pouilly-Vinzelles, but is located slightly closer to Mâcon. These three neighbouring appellations all produce white wines of a similar style."
"Coteaux Champenois is a wine Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) in the Champagne province of France. It covers the same area as sparkling Champagne production, but covers only still wines. The grapes are the same as those allowed for sparkling Champagne: Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier for red wines, and Chardonnay for whites. Rosé wines are made very rarely, but there is also a rosé AOC in the Champagne region, Rosé des Riceys. Production is small, especially in vintages where yields are low, given the high demand for Champagne and the higher profit of producing sparkling wine."
"Terrasses du Larzac is an Appellation d’origine contrôlée (AOC) within the in Southern France ( French Occitania ) created in 2005 for red wines made from Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre grapes, with the acceptable additions of Cinsaut and Carignan, and grown in some of the highest vineyards of the Côteaux du Languedoc on the slopes of the Cevennes. The appellation includes St-Saturnin (cited by Jancis Robinson as, ""one of the more exciting of the named crus within the Côteaux du Languedoc appellation including parts of St-Guiraud, Jonquières, and Arboras"", and Montpeyroux (cited by Robinson as, ""the highest named cru within the Côteaux du Languedoc in southern France and, with nearby Pic-St-Loup, the most exciting""). The Terrasses du Larzac region encompasses the villages of Aniane and Jonquières, Hérault - respective homes of Mas de Daumas Gassac (1974) and Mas Jullien (1985) and site of the renaissance in Languedoc wine. One of France’s most recent appellations (2005) it overlaps in parts with that of Roquefort, France’s oldest and the world’s first appellation (1925) in the villages of Pégairolles-de-l'Escalette and Octon. Here the grazing of Lacaune, Manech, and Basco-Béarnaise for the production of Roquefort occurs alongside the growing of Grenache, Syrah, and Mouvedre for Terrasses du Larzac wine."

They lie on sloping hillsides on the left bank of the River Cher, in south-east Touraine. A range of grape varieties are grown here, but Sauvignon blanc is the main white variety, while Gamay is the main red variety."
"Touraine is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) in the Loire Valley wine region in France that produce dry, white wines and red wines rich in tannins. The AOC status was awarded by a decree of December 24, 1939 (modified by the decree of August 29, 2002). The wine-growing area extends over 5,300 hectares (13,000 acres) departments of Indre-et-Loire, Indre and Loir-et-Cher and comprises a total of 70 communes and it is thus a ""subregional"" appellation covering the same area as a number of local AOCs."
"Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil is a French wine Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) in the Loire valley on the right bank of the River Loire. The AOC was created by a decree on July 31, 1937, covering about 800 hectares in the commune of Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil in the département of Indre-et-Loire. Saint Nicolas de Bourgueil produces both red wine and rosé wines though rosés usually account for only about 2% of the production. The main variety of the AOC is Cabernet Franc (locally called Breton), which is allowed to be supplemented with up to 10% Cabernet Sauvignon.

"Château-Grillet is a wine-growing AOC in the northern Rhône wine region of France, near Vienne, which produces white wine from Viognier grapes. The whole appellation, which is only 3.8 hectares (9.4 acres) in size, is owned by a single winery, Château-Grillet. The appellation was officially created in 1936. Château-Grillet AOC is effectively an enclave of the Condrieu appellation, which also produces Viognier-only white wines. These appellations are located just south of Vienne in the northern part of the Rhône valley. The production of white wine in the Rhône region is relatively small compared to the red wines. Condrieu and Château-Grillet are the only appellations in northern Rhône that are exclusively white wine appellations. The situation of an AOC (or other official wine designation) owned by a single estate is a situation known as a monopole. There are several other monopole estates in France including Romanée-Conti, La Tâche, La Romanée, Clos de Tart, and Clos de la Coulée de Serrant. The family acquired the Château-Grillet estate in 1830, and the family retained ownership until the estate was purchased by French billionaire François Pinault in 2011. Today, Isabelle Baratin manages the production and sale of the estate's single wine: Vin Blanc de Château-Grillet. Only 10,000 bottles are produced each year. The estate also produces two Brandies: Fine du Château-Grillet and Marc du Château-Grillet. The former is distilled from the Château-Grillet wine while the latter is a pomace brandy. The vineyards stretch over two communes: Saint-Michel-sur-Rhône and Vérin. The vines are situated in terraces on steep granite cliffs surrounding the estate where the soil is lighter and more fragmented than in the Condrieu AOC. The slopes are shaped in the form of a natural amphitheater with south-southeastern sun exposure. The estate's vines average 40 years of age, and as a result produce very low yields. The slim brown bottles of Château-Grillet are easily recognised and are used by no other French winery. Until 1987, 70 centiliter bottles were used, but 75 cl bottles have been used since."
"Saint-Péray is a French wine Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) in the northern Rhône wine region of France. Located in the southernmost part of Northern Rhône, the appellation is very small and not widely known. The production is mainly white sparkling wine, somewhat like Champagne. However, some still wine is also made. All Saint-Péray wine is white."
"Vin de Savoie is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) for red and white wines in the Savoy wine region of France, which is located in the foothills of the Alps. The region is divided roughly into three distinct parts: the glacially sculpted terrain along the South shore of Lake Geneva, the hilly country near the northern end of Lac de Bourget, and the area bordering the Massif de Bauges South of Chambéry. The wines are mostly white, made from grape varieties Chasselas, Jacquère, Altesse (also known as Roussette), Verdesse, Chardonnay and Roussanne grapes, although there are also some (relatively light) reds made from Mondeuse, Gamay noir and occasionally Pinot noir, and rosés made from Gamay, and some sparkling wines."
"Seyssel is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) for white wine in the Savoy wine region of France. The wines are exclusively white, made from the regional grape varieties Altesse and Molette. They are considered to be most suitable to be consumed young."
"Roussette de Savoie is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) for white wine in the Savoy wine region of France. The AOC covers much of the Western part of the Savoie AOC for wines made at least in part from the regional grape variety known as Altesse, also called Roussette. Roussette de Savoie is the second-largest appellation in Savoie and is responsible (as of 2012) for approximately 10% of the region's production. The late-ripening grape Altesse is the only permitted variety in the appellation. Formerly, wines that were designated merely as Roussette de Savoie AOC (rather than with some specific Cru) were blended with up to 50% Chardonnay, although blending with Chardonnay is no longer permitted. Roussette de Savoie's high acidity give it the potential to age. These dry white wines typically have a nose of violet and mountain herbs with flavors of minerals, bergamot, honey and hazelnut."
"Pécharmant is a wine appellation (Appellation d'origine contrôlée, AOC) for certain wines produced in the hills to the North-East of the market town of Bergerac, France. With a surface area of 400 hectares the communes of Bergerac, Creysse and Lembras produce nearly 15 000 hectolitres of the red wine.

Nearly all the national production is drunk within the national boundaries; less than 2% of the wine is exported (mainly to Germany). For example, in 2019, only 13,193 hectolitres were exported. Switzerland ranks in the top 10 of per capita consumption of wine, and as of 1983 imported two thirds of it, including more Beaujolais than the United States. In 2019, 1,784,371 hectolitres of wine consumed was imported, compared to 945,585 hectolitres of domestic wine consumed."
"Vazisubani (Georgian: ვაზისუბანი) is an appellation for wines produced in a 62-square-kilometer zone around Vazisubani village in eastern Georgia. Vazisubani is a dry, still white wine made of two grape varieties: Rkatsiteli and Mtsvane."

It contains 10.5–12% alcohol, 3–5% sugar and has 5–7% titrated acidity. The wine has been manufactured since 1958."
"Dessert wines, sometimes called pudding wines in the United Kingdom, are sweet wines typically served with dessert. There is no simple definition of a dessert wine. In the UK, a dessert wine is considered to be any sweet wine drunk with a meal, as opposed to the white fortified wines (fino and amontillado sherry) drunk before the meal and the red fortified wines (port and madeira) drunk after it. Thus, most fortified wines are regarded as distinct from dessert wines, but some of the less-strong fortified white wines, such as Pedro Ximénez sherry and Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise, are regarded as honorary dessert wines. In the United States, by contrast, a dessert wine is legally defined as any wine over 14% alcohol by volume, which includes all fortified wines—and is taxed more highly as a result. This dates back to when the US wine industry only made dessert wines by fortification, but such a classification is outdated now that modern yeast and viticulture can produce dry wines over 15% without fortification (and German dessert wines can contain half that amount of alcohol)."
"Côtes de Toul is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) for French wine produced in the département of Meurthe-et-Moselle in the Lorraine région. The Côtes de Toul vineyards cover 110 hectares (270 acres) in an area close to Toul, to the west of the city of Nancy. The area of production includes the following communes: Blénod-lès-Toul, Bruley, Bulligny, Charmes-la-Côte, Domgermain, Lucey, Mont-le-Vignoble and Pagney-derrière-Barine. Annual production is 4,500 hectoliter, corresponding to 600,000 bottles. Côtes de Toul has been classified as an AOC since 1998, when it was promoted from its previous VDQS status. Together with the other Lorraine wine designations, AOC Moselle and Vin de Pays de la Meuse, the produce of the 200 hectares (490 acres) of Lorraine vineyards is often referred to in French as Vins de l'est, ""wines of the east"". Most Côtes de Toul and other Lorraine wines are consumed in Lorraine itself, with only a small proportion reaching the rest of France and nearby export markets."
"Spanish wine (Spanish: vinos españoles) includes red, white, and sparkling wines produced throughout the country. Located on the Iberian Peninsula, Spain has over 1.2 million hectares (2.9 million acres) planted in wine grapes, making it the most widely planted wine-producing nation, but the second largest producer of wine in the world, behind Italy and ahead of France and the United States. This is due, in part, to the very low yields and wide spacing of the old vines planted on the dry, infertile soil found in some of the Spanish wine regions. The country is ninth in worldwide consumption with Spaniards drinking, on average, 21.6 litres (5.7 US gal) per person a year. The country has an abundance of native grape varieties, with over 400 varieties planted throughout Spain, though 88 percent of the country's wine production is from only 20 grapes — including the reds Tempranillo, Bobal, Garnacha, and Monastrell; the whites Albariño, Airén, Verdejo, Palomino, and Macabeo; and the three Cava grapes Parellada, Xarel·lo, and Macabeo. Major Spanish wine regions include the Rioja and Ribera del Duero, which are known for their Tempranillo production; Jumilla, known for its Monastrell production; Jerez de la Frontera, the home of the fortified wine Sherry; Rías Baixas in the northwest region of Galicia that is known for its white wines made from Albariño and Catalonia which includes the Cava and still wine-producing regions of the Penedès as well the Priorat region."

Red, rosé and a few white wines are produced-the reds from Grenache noir, Mourvèdre, Syrah, Carignan and Cinsaut grapes; the white are made from a blend of Grenache blanc and Grenache gris. The boundaries of the AOC are identical with the Banyuls AOC as many of the grapes grown in Collioure are destined for use in the fortified Vins doux naturels of the region. The grapes that do not get used for Banyuls are then produced as non-fortified still wines under the Collioure AOC."
"Chambertin is an Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) and Grand Cru vineyard for red wine in the Côte de Nuits subregion of Burgundy, with Pinot noir as the main grape variety. Chambertin is located within the commune of Gevrey-Chambertin, and it is situated approximately in the centre of a group of nine Grand Cru vineyards all having ""Chambertin"" as part of their name. The other eight vineyards, which all are separate AOCs, have hyphenated names where Chambertin appears together with something else, such as Chapelle-Chambertin. Chambertin itself is situated above (to the west of) the Route des Grands Crus. It borders on Chambertin-Clos de Bèze in the north, Griotte-Chambertin and Charmes-Chambertin in the east (across the road) and the Latricières-Chambertin in the south. The AOC was created in 1937. Of the surrounding vineyards, wines from Chambertin-Clos de Bèze may also be sold under the Chambertin AOC. However, Chambertin-Clos de Bèze has a very good reputation on its own, so this is not widely practiced. The other seven ""hyphenated Chambertin"" Grand Cru vineyards do not have this right to use the Chambertin AOC."
"Musigny, sometimes referred to as Le Musigny, is an Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) and Grand Cru vineyard for red and white wine in Côte de Nuits of Burgundy. It is located within the commune of Chambolle-Musigny, to the south of the village itself. It borders on the Grand Cru Clos de Vougeot in the southeast, the Grand Cru Échezeaux in the south, and the Premier Cru Les Amoureuses in the northeast. The name is derived from a family de Musigny which is now extinct, but which held offices in the court of the Dukes of Burgundy from the 14th century. The AOC was created in 1936, but the borders of Musigny were previously set down legally in 1929. Musigny is the only Grand Cru vineyard in Côte de Nuits that produces both white and red wines, although the production of red wine dominates by over 90 per cent. All other Burgundy Grand Crus for white wine are located in the Côte de Beaune."
"Corton is an Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) and Grand Cru vineyard for red and white wine in Côte de Beaune subregion of Burgundy. It is located on a hill shared between the three villages of Aloxe-Corton, Pernand-Vergelesses and Ladoix in the Côte de Beaune, Burgundy. The appellation covers the lower parts of the Corton hill and includes several subordinate vineyard names, or climats, within the AOC. Because of the size of the AOC and the variability of these climats, it is the rule rather than the exception that the name of the climat is indicated together with that of the Corton AOC, leading to designations such as Corton Clos du Roi and Corton Les Bressandes. Corton is rare in this aspect, as the 'climat' is seldom used for other Grand Cru appellations in Côte d'Or. The AOC was created in 1937. Corton wines are mostly red (around 95 per cent of the total production in the AOC) and made from the Pinot noir grape, however a smaller quantity of white Corton from Chardonnay is also produced. Around 500,000 bottles a year are produced from the vines. The Corton appellation itself is the Côte de Beaune's only Grand Cru appellation for red wine, and is the largest Grand Cru of Burgundy."
"Grands Échezeaux is an Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) and Grand Cru vineyard for red wine in the Côte de Nuits subregion of Burgundy, with Pinot noir as the main grape variety.

"La Grande Rue is an Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) and Grand Cru vineyard for red wine in the Côte de Nuits subregion of Burgundy, with Pinot Noir as the main grape variety."
"Clos des Lambrays is an Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) and Grand Cru vineyard for red wine in the Côte de Nuits subregion of Burgundy, with Pinot noir as the main grape variety. It is situated in the commune of Morey-Saint-Denis in the Côte-d'Or département, and is located immediately to the southwest of the village Morey-Saint-Denis. The Clos part of its name refers to a wall-enclosed vineyard. Clos des Lambrays was elevated from premier cru to grand cru status in 1981, which meant that it was created as a separate AOC. Clos de Lambrays totals 8.84 hectares (21.8 acres) and most of it (8.66 hectares (21.4 acres)) is owned by the winery . However, Domaine Taupenot-Merme also has a small holding in this vineyard, so Domaine des Lambrays is unable to put a ""Monopole"" label on its bottles."
"Corton-Charlemagne is an Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) and Grand Cru vineyard for white wine in Côte de Beaune subregion of Burgundy. It is located in the communes of Aloxe-Corton, Pernand-Vergelesses and Ladoix-Serrigny with Chardonnay being the only permitted grape variety. Around 300,000 bottles of white wine are produced each year in the appellation. Corton-Charlemagne is named after the Holy Roman Emperor Charlemagne, who once owned the hill of Corton on which the vineyards now rest. The first mention of a Clos de Charlemagne dates to 1375, in a lease of the 'Clos le Charlemagne' by the Chapitre de Saint-Androche-de- Saulieu. According to later legend, the vineyards are dedicated to white grape varieties because the emperor's wife preferred white wines as they did not stain his beard. The AOC was created in 1937. The vines are located on the higher ground of a hilltop that stretches between the Burgundian villages of Ladoix-Serrigny and Pernand-Vergelesses. The slopes planted with the most valuable vineyards face south-east on the hilltop, with the land gradually sloping downwards towards the major French highway Route 74. The red wine appellation of Corton covers the lower part of the hill with the areas for Corton and Corton-Charlemagne partially overlapping. Furthermore, there is a third Grand Cru appellation on the Corton hill, Charlemagne, that may be used for white wine produced from the En Charlemagne lieu-dit. However, as En Charlemagne is only 0.28 hectares in size, production is limited and usually blended with grapes from the other lieu-dits of Corton-Charlemagne. As of 2012, the Corton-Charlemagne AOC was producing an average of 2,280 hectoliters of wine a year (around 304,000 bottles of wine) representing more than 2 out of every 3 bottles of all the Grand Cru class white wine produced throughout the Côte de Nuits and Côte de Beaune. Bonneau du Martray is the largest single owner of vines within the Corton-Charlemagne vineyard with 9.5 hectares."
"Montrachet (pronounced Mon-rashay; French pronunciation: ​[mɔ̃ʁaʃɛ]) is an Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) and Grand Cru vineyard for white wine made of Chardonnay in the Côte de Beaune subregion of Burgundy. It straddles the border between the two communes of Chassagne-Montrachet and Puligny-Montrachet and produces what many consider to be the greatest dry white wine in the world. It is surrounded by four other Grand Cru vineyards all having ""Montrachet"" as part of their names. Montrachet itself is generally considered superior to its four Grand Cru neighbours, and this is reflected in its higher price. Montrachet is located in the south of the Côte de Beaune, which is the southern half of the Côte d'Or, which in turn is the most important of the several wine producing subregions of Burgundy. The Montrachet vineyard is almost equally divided between Puligny-Montrachet and Chassagne-Montrachet. Both of these appellations have, as is customary, appended the name of their most famous vineyard (in this case a shared one) to the name of their main village. The wine from the Chassagne side is usually known as Le Montrachet while the wine from the Puligny side is known as Montrachet."

"Kremstal is an Austrian wine region. Downstream of the Wachau, it is centred on the town of Krems. The climate is a little warmer because the valley opens out a little, allowing more red wine to be produced, but otherwise Kremstal is quite similar to the Wachau."
"Kamptal is an Austrian wine, tourismus, culture and health region located in Waldviertel, Lower Austria. It is named by the river Kamp. To the north of Krems lies Langenlois, which is the main vine-town of Kamptal, the valley of the river Kamp. The sandstone slopes are so steep that only a thin layer of soil is retained. Exposure to the sun is high. Riesling thrives on these steep slopes; closer to the Danube the valley broadens and more red grapes are grown. Another prominent town in the Kamptal is Gars am Kamp."
"Chianti (Italian pronunciation: [ˈkjanti]), in Italy also referred to as Monti del Chianti (""Chianti Mountains"") or Colline del Chianti (""Chianti Hills""), is a mountainous area of Tuscany in the provinces of Florence, Siena and Arezzo, composed mainly of hills and mountains. It is known for the wine produced in and named for the region, Chianti."
"Late harvest wine is wine made from grapes left on the vine longer than usual. Late harvest is usually an indication of a sweet dessert wine, such as late harvest Riesling. Late harvest grapes are often more similar to raisins, but have been naturally dehydrated while on the vine. Botrytis cinerea, or noble rot, is a mold that causes grapes to lose nearly all of their water content. Wines made from botrytis-affected grapes are generally very sweet."
"Croatian wine (vino, pl. vina) has a history dating back to the Ancient Greek settlers, and their wine production on the southern Dalmatian islands of Vis, Hvar and Korčula some 2,500 years ago. Like other old world wine producers, many traditional grape varieties still survive in Croatia, perfectly suited to their local wine hills. Modern wine-production methods have taken over in the larger wineries and EU-style wine regulations have been adopted, guaranteeing the quality of the wine. There are currently over 300 geographically defined wine regions and a strict classification system to ensure quality and origin. The majority of Croatian wine is white, with most of the remainder being red and only a small percentage being rosé wines. In 2014, Croatia ranked 32nd in wine production by country with an estimated 45,272 tonnes. Wine is a popular drink in Croatia, and locals traditionally like to drink wine with their meals. Quite often, the wine is diluted with either still or sparkling water—producing a drinks known as gemišt (a combination of white wine and carbonated water) and bevanda (a combination of red wine and still water)."
"Hungarian wine has a history dating back to the Kingdom of Hungary. Outside Hungary, the best-known wines are the white dessert wine Tokaji aszú (particularly in the Czech Republic, Poland, and Slovakia) and the red wine Bull's Blood of Eger (Egri Bikavér)."
"Rimon is a brand of pomegranate wine produced in Israel. In recent years, Pomegranate wine was industrialized by Rimon Winery in the Galilee and branded as Rimon. Rimon is made from a special variety of pomegranates that were developed in Israel that contain high levels of Sugar."
"Israeli wine is produced by hundreds of wineries, ranging in size from small boutique enterprises to large companies producing over ten million bottles per year. Wine has been produced in the Land of Israel since biblical times. Wine was exported to Rome during the Roman period, but under the Muslim rulers the production was virtually wiped out. Under the Crusaders, winemaking was temporarily revived. The modern Israeli wine industry was founded by Baron Edmond James de Rothschild, owner of the Bordeaux estate Château Lafite-Rothschild. Today, Israeli winemaking takes place in five vine-growing regions: Galil (Galilee, including the Golan Heights), the region most suited for viticulture due to its high elevation, cool breezes, marked day and night temperature changes and rich, well-drained soils; the Judean Hills, surrounding the city of Jerusalem; Shimshon (Samson), located between the Judean Hills and the Coastal Plain; the Negev, a semi-arid desert region, where drip irrigation has made grape growing possible; and the Sharon plain near the Mediterranean coast and just south of Haifa, surrounding the towns of Zichron Ya'akov and Binyamina, which is the largest grape growing area in Israel. In 2011, Israeli wine exports totaled over $26.7 million. As of 2012, Israel had 12,355 acres of vineyards."
"Lebanon is among the oldest sites of wine production in the world. The Israelite prophet Hosea (780–725 BC) is said to have urged his followers to return to God so that ""they will blossom as the vine and fame be like the wine of Lebanon, [and] their fragrance will be like that of Lebanon"". The Phoenicians of the coastal strip were instrumental in spreading wine and viticulture throughout the Mediterranean in ancient times. Despite the many conflicts of the region, the country has an annual production of about 8,500,000 bottles of wine."
"South African wine has a history dating back to 1659, with the first bottle produced in Cape Town by its founder Jan van Riebeeck. Access to international markets led to new investment in the South African wine market. Production is concentrated around Cape Town, with major vineyard and production centres at Constantia, Paarl, Stellenbosch and Worcester. There are about 60 appellations within the Wine of Origin (WO) system, which was implemented in 1973 with a hierarchy of designated production regions, districts and wards. WO wines must only contain grapes from the specific area of origin. ""Single vineyard"" wines must come from a defined area of less than 6 hectares. An ""Estate Wine"" can come from adjacent farms if they are farmed together and wine is produced on site. A ward is an area with a distinctive soil type or climate and is roughly equivalent to a European appellation."
"Tunisian wine has a long history dating back to the Antiquity like most Mediterranean countries with the Phoenicians and Carthage . The agronomist Mago that lived in the city of Carthage, wrote a treaty about agronomy and viticulture, from which its techniques are still used until this day. Despite the arrival of a Muslim power since the 7th century AD, viticulture and wine production never quite disappeared from Tunisia. Rosé wine accounts for a large proportion of the Tunisian production."
"Albanian wine (Albanian: Vera Shqiptare) is produced in several regions throughout Albania within the Mediterranean Basin. The country has one of the oldest wine making traditions, dating back at least 3000 years ago to the Bronze Age Illyrians. It belongs chronologically to the old world of wine producing countries. Albania is a mountainous Mediterranean country with the Mediterranean Sea to the west. The country experiences a distinctly Mediterranean climate, which means that the winters are mild and summers usually hot and dry. The favourable climate and fertile soil of the mountainous areas of the country are well suited to viticulture. Albania produced an estimated 17,500 tonnes of wine in 2009."
"Wine has been produced in the United States since the 1500s, with the first widespread production beginning in New Mexico in 1628. Today, wine production is undertaken in all fifty states, with California producing 84 percent of all US wine. The North American continent is home to several native species of grape, including Vitis labrusca, Vitis riparia, Vitis rotundifolia, and Vitis vulpina, but the wine-making industry is based almost entirely on the cultivation of the European Vitis vinifera, which was introduced by European settlers. With more than 1,100,000 acres (4,500 km2) under vine, the United States is the fourth-largest wine producing country in the world, after Italy, Spain, and France."
"Fondillón is a special style of wine produced in the Alicante D.O. in Spain. Fondillón is a red wine produced in an oxidised (rancio) style from overripe Monastrell grapes, and is typically semi-sweet. Its alcohol level is similar to many fortified wines, although Fondillón is not fortified. Fondillón is typically bottled and sold after an extended period of aging in barrel (minimum 10 years). It can either be vintage-dated or come from a solera. Common pairings include cheese, in particular blue cheese, as well as chocolate and chocolate-based desserts."
"Winemaking has a long tradition in Egypt dating back to the 3rd millennium BC. The modern wine industry is relatively small scale but there have been significant strides towards reviving the industry. In the late nineties the industry invited international expertise in a bid to improve the quality of Egyptian wine, which used to be known for its poor quality. In recent years Egyptian wines have received some recognition, having won several international awards. In 2013 Egypt produced 4,500 tonnes of wine, ranking 54th globally, ahead of Belgium and the United Kingdom."
"Vin cuit or cooked wine is an artisanal dessert wine produced in Provence, France. It is made by heating grape juice without boiling it so that the grape juice becomes concentrated and syrupy. It is then fermented in barrels. The alcohol content is around 14%. Vin cuit is not a fortified wine. Its Italian counterpart is the vino cotto. Production of this wine style is limited. It is regularly served on Christmas Eve."
"English sparkling wine is sparkling wine from England, typically produced to the traditional method and mostly using the same varieties of grapes as used in Champagne – Chardonnay, Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier. English sparkling wine producers often employ Champagne terminology to describe the styles of their wine, such as ""Classic Cuvée"", ""Blanc de Blancs"" or ""Demi-Sec"". The terms ""English"" and ""English Regional"" as applied to sparkling wine are protected terms under the respective PDO and PGI classifications, although not all producers of sparkling wine in England choose to participate in these schemes.The PDO permits six varietals for English sparkling wine (Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier, Pinot Noir Précoce, Pinot Blanc and Pinot Gris) whereas the PGI is much more flexible, with around 90 permitted varietals. The majority of wine produced in England is now sparkling: in 2017 sparkling wine accounted for 68% of wine produced in England and Wales, or four million bottles, and the three Champagne varieties account for 71.2% of grape varieties planted. There are over 100 wineries in England producing sparkling wines with Nyetimber, Ridgeview, Gusbourne, Chapel Down and Bolney Wine Estate being some of the largest producers. Early figures for 2018 suggest in excess of 10 million bottles of English sparkling wine were produced."
"Vallée de la Marne is a sub-region of the Champagne wine region.It is south of Champagne and Montagne de Reims, and north of Côte de Sézanne and Côte des Blancs.The sub-region is located on the riverbanks of the Marne.Its soils are more variable than in other Champagne sub-regions, and it contains only two Grands Crus villages: Ay and Tours-sur-Marne. Pinot Meunier is the main grape variety."
"Cru is a wine term used to indicate a high-quality vineyard or group of vineyards. It is a French word which is traditionally translated as ""growth"", as it was originally the past participle of the verb ""croître"" (to grow). The term is often used within classifications of French wine. By implication, a wine that displays (or is allowed to display) the name of its cru on its wine label is supposed to exhibit the typical characteristics of this cru. The terms Premier Cru and Grand Cru designate levels of presumed quality that are variously defined in different wine regions."
"Vino de Calidad con indicación geográfica (VC) ('quality wine with geographic indication'), is classification for Spanish wine. The category was formed in 2003 along with Vino de Pago. The VC category is used for wines that do not fully meet the stringent standards of the DO category, but are above the standards of the Indicación Geográfica Protegida (IGP) category. As of 2019, there were 7 VCs. The category of VC is within the denominación de origen protegida DOP ('protected denomination of origin') category, the mainstay of Spain's wine quality control system. As of 2019 there were 96 DOPs that are subdivided into DOCa (Denominación de origen Calificada), DO (Denominación de origen), Vino de Pago (VP), and VC. The sub-categories can be called DOP, or they can use the traditional terms of DOCa, DO, VP, and VC."
"Liebfraumilch or Liebfrauenmilch (German for 'Beloved lady's milk', GRAPE in reference to the Virgin Mary) is a style of semi-sweet white German wine which may be produced, mostly for export, in the regions Rheinhessen, Palatinate, Rheingau, and Nahe. The original German spelling of the word is Liebfrauenmilch, given to the wine produced from the vineyards of the or ""Church of Our Lady"" in the Rhineland-Palatinate city of Worms since the eighteenth century. The spelling Liebfraumilch is more common on labels of exported wine."
"Le Conseil Interprofessionnel du Vin de Bordeaux, or CIVB, the Bordeaux wine Bureau, created in 1948, is a French interest group that represents nearly 10,000 Bordeaux wine producers and growers, and 400 négociants. It is by some estimated to be the most important wine industry body in France. A private association under the responsibility of the Ministère de l'Agriculture (Ministry of Agricultural Affairs), CIVB seeks to promote the interests of its members via national and international communications channels, conduct research into market trends in both production to distribution, and address viticulturally technical issues of quality, environmental and heritage concerns. Presidents of the organisation are elected for two-year terms by the membership, chosen alternately from growers and négociants. The position, in charge of a €22m budget, is considered one of the most powerful positions in Bordeaux. The current president of CIVB is Alain Vironneau, and past presidents include Henri Martin, Eric Dulong, Jean-Louis Trocard and Christian Delpeuch. Jean-Paul Jauffret, a former president, is the honorary president of CIVB."

"The History of Alsace begins when the area was inhabited by nomadic hunters in antiquity, and includes several changes in political control of the area between Germany and France."
"The Champagne wine region is a wine region within the historical province of Champagne in the northeast of France. The area is best known for the production of the sparkling white wine that bears the region's name. EU law and the laws of most countries reserve the term ""Champagne"" exclusively for wines that come from this region located about 160 kilometres (100 miles) east of Paris. The viticultural boundaries of Champagne are legally defined and split into five wine-producing districts within the historical province: Aube, Côte des Blancs, Côte de Sézanne, Montagne de Reims, and Vallée de la Marne. The towns of Reims and Épernay are the commercial centers of the area. Reims is famous for its cathedral, the venue of the coronation of the French Kings and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Located at the northern edges of France, the history of the Champagne wine region has had a significant role in the development of this unique terroir. The area's proximity to Paris promoted the region's economic success in its wine trade but also put the villages and vineyards in the path of marching armies on their way to the French capital. Despite the frequency of these military conflicts, the region developed a reputation for quality wine production in the early Middle Ages and was able to continue that reputation as the region's producers began making sparkling wine with the advent of the great Champagne houses in the 17th and 18th centuries. The principal grapes grown in the region include Chardonnay, Pinot noir, and Pinot Meunier. Pinot noir is the most widely planted grape in the Aube region and grows very well in Montagne de Reims. Pinot Meunier is the dominant grape in the Vallée de la Marne region. The Côte des Blancs is dedicated almost exclusively to Chardonnay."
"Saint-Aubin wine is produced in the commune of Saint-Aubin in Côte de Beaune of Burgundy. Rather than being situated on the main Côte d'Or escarpment, as most of the other Côte de Beaune wine villages, the vineyards of Saint-Aubin are mainly located in a side valley to the west of Chassagne-Montrachet. The Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) Saint-Aubin may be used for white and red wine with respectively Chardonnay and Pinot noir as the main grape variety. The production consists of around 75% white wine, and 25% red wine. There are no Grand Cru vineyards within the Saint-Aubin AOC. In 2008, there was 162.81 hectares (402.3 acres) of vineyard surface in production for Saint-Aubin wine at village and Premier Cru level, and 8,264 hectoliter of wine was produced, of which 6,247 hectoliter white wine and 2,017 hectoliter red wine. Some 49.38 hectares (122.0 acres) of this area was used for the red wines in 2007. The total amount produced corresponds to around 1.1 million bottles, of which just over 800,000 bottles of white wine and just over 300,000 bottles of red wine. For white wines, the AOC regulations allow both Chardonnay and Pinot blanc to be used, but most wines are 100% Chardonnay. The AOC regulations also allow up to 15 per cent total of Chardonnay, Pinot blanc and Pinot gris as accessory grapes in the red wines, but this not very often practiced. The allowed base yield is 40 hectoliter per hectare of red wine and 45 hectoliter per hectare for white wine. The grapes must reach a maturity of at least 10.5 per cent potential alcohol for village-level red wine, 11.0 per cent for village-level white wine and Premier Cru red wine, and 11.5 per cent for Premier Cru white wine."
"The Sherry Triangle, is an area in the province of Cádiz in southwestern Spain. It is noted for the production of sherry, a type of fortified wine. The cities of Jerez de la Frontera, Sanlúcar de Barrameda, and El Puerto de Santa María are at the vertices of the triangle. The bodegas where the wine is blended and stored are all located within the cities. The Denominación de Origen (Designation of Origin) for sherry was established in 1933. The Sherry Triangle is the aging area of ""El Marco de Jerez"" (the Sherry Setting). All the grapes must come from this wider production area, which includes Trebujena, Chiclana, Puerto Real, Rota, Chipiona and Lebrija. Exports of sherry fell considerably during the period 2002–2014, with Spain itself becoming the largest consumer, moving ahead of the UK and Holland. Exports fell from 700,000hl in 2002 to 370,000hl in 2011. Between 2007 and 2011, 35% of the region's vineyards were taken out of production under an EU grubbing up initiative."
"The Haus der Deutschen Weinstraße (""House of the German Wine Route"") has since 1995 marked the northern end of the German Wine Route at Bockenheim. In this respect it is a belated balancing feature for the German Wine Gate, 85 kilometers (53 miles) to the south which has marked the southern end of the German Wine Route at Schweigen since 1936. Apart from its unusual architecture and its position at the end of the German Wine Route, its most obvious feature is a large restaurant, much of which is built out over the road that previously divided Großbockenheim from Kleinbockenheim."
"Gibbston is a community in the Wakatipu Basin in the Otago region of the South Island, New Zealand. Through the valley runs the Kawarau River which forms the Kawarau Gorge. The most visible aspect of the area are the vineyards and wineries next to SH 6 which form part of the Central Otago wine region. The Gibbston region is the coolest and highest of the Central Otago regions with the majority of land gently sloping to the north. This northerly aspect greatly assists vineyards to grow grapes because of increased sunlight and with a reduced possibility of frost, although this still poses a significant threat. It was voted community of the year in 2011 due to the work on the Gibbston River Trail. The Gibbston River Trail and the Gibbston Highway Trail are walking/running and cycling trails that give good access to the wineries in the area but also connect to The Queenstown Trail at the Kawarau Gorge Suspension Bridge. Often Gibbston is incorrectly called Gibbston Valley or Gibbston Flats due to the land being the only flat usable land in the Kawarau Gorge."
"Te Koko-o-Kupe / Cloudy Bay or simply Cloudy Bay is located at the northeast of New Zealand's South Island, to the south of the Marlborough Sounds and north of Clifford Bay. In August 2014, the name Cloudy Bay, given by Captain Cook in 1770, was officially altered to Te Koko-o-Kupe / Cloudy Bay, with the Māori name recalling the early explorer Kupe scooping up oysters from the bay.The area lends its name to one of the best known New World white wines (Cloudy Bay Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc) although the grapes used in production of that wine are grown in the Marlborough wine region further inland."
"Hipping is a 23-hectare-sized (57-acre) vineyard of the red slope in the municipality Nierstein in Germany. Located at the Rhenish Hessian Rhineterrace (Rhineland-Palatinate), wines of this vineyard can be marketed as ""Großes Gewächs"" or ""Erste Lage"", provided that other quality characteristics are fulfilled."
"Niersteiner Glöck is a 2.1 hectares (5.2 acres) wall-enclosed vineyard (a Clos, using French terminology) in Nierstein in Rheinhessen, Germany. It is the oldest named vineyard site in Germany. Glöck is one of handful single vineyard sites in Germany which for reasons of historical significance have dispensation from having to include a village name together with the vineyard's name, so the wines from the Glöck vineyard site are simply labelled Glöck. Since 1925, the vineyard belongs exclusively to the Staatliche Weinbaudomäne Oppenheim (State Domain Oppenheim Winery), which is owned by the government of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, and is part of the Dienstleistungszentrum Ländlicher Raum Rheinhessen-Nahe-Hunsrück (Service Centre Rural Zone Rheinhessen-Nahe-Hunsrück). The vineyard is currently planted with Riesling and Pinot noir vines."
"Château de l'Hospital is a Bordeaux winery in the Graves AOC. It is a 12-acre domaine. The red wine is made of cabernet franc, cabernet sauvignon, and a small amount of malbec. Madame de Lacaussade took over as winemaker in 1964 following her husband's accidental fall in a vinifying vat and later death, as her sons were not keen to become winemakers.

"Domaine Laroche is a family business winery in the Chablis AOC.The vineyards of Domaine Laroche are spread across Chablis, and are currently undergoing conversion to organic viticulture. Grégory Viennois, a graduate of the University of Burgundy, is the winemaker. Chablis AOC wines are produced exclusively from the Chardonnay grape. Domaine Laroche decided to bottle its offering under screw caps to keep wines fresh and prevent cork taint, but later switched back to using corks."
"Domaine Montrose is a Côtes de Thongue appellation French wine estate founded in the South of France in 1701.It is named for its location on a volcano (mont) and the pink (rose) almond tree flowers that surround the vineyards.The vineyard is 100 hectares (1 km2). Family owned since its founding in 1701, Bernard Coste represents the 11th family generation at the Domaine; his son Olivier joined him in 2009. The Domaine's typical rosé wine blend is 65% grenache, 25% cabernet sauvignon, and 10% syrah.Its typical red wine blend is 35% merlot, 35% syrah, and 30% grenache. Its grand vin is Salamandre, of which only 7,000 bottles are produced per year; it is 60% cabernet sauvignon and 40% syrah."

"Tokaji (Hungarian: of Tokaj Hungarian pronunciation: [ˈtokɒji]) or Tokay is the name of the wines from the Tokaj wine region (also Tokaj-Hegyalja wine region or Tokaj-Hegyalja) in Hungary or the adjoining Tokaj wine region in Slovakia. This region is noted for its sweet wines made from grapes affected by noble rot, a style of wine which has a long history in this region. The ""nectar"" coming from the grapes of Tokaj is also mentioned in the national anthem of Hungary. The Slovak wine region of Tokaj may use the Tokajský/-á/-é label (""of Tokaj"" in Slovak) if they apply the Hungarian quality control regulation. This area used to be part of the greater Tokaj-Hegyalja region within the Kingdom of Hungary, but was divided between Hungary and Czechoslovakia after the Treaty of Trianon."
"Prosecco (/prəˈsɛkoʊ, proʊ-/; Italian: [proˈsekko]) is an Italian DOC or DOCG white wine produced in a large area spanning nine provinces in the Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia regions, and named after the village of Prosecco which is in the province of Trieste, Italy. It is made from the Prosecco grape (renamed Glera in 2009 within the European Union) but denomination rules allow up to 15% of the wine to be other permitted varieties. Prosecco is almost always made in sparkling or semi-sparkling style (spumante and frizzante, respectively), but a still wine (tranquillo) is also permitted. Within the larger designation are two small DOCG areas, Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco in the hills between the towns of Conegliano and Valdobbiadene, and Asolo Prosecco around the nearby town of Asolo. Prosecco Superiore is always spumante and comes only from these DOCG areas. In 2019, Le Colline del Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene became a UNESCO World Heritage Site, in large part due to the region's role in the production of Prosecco. Since 2020 the DOC rules allow a rosé variety of Prosecco designated spumante rosé, which must contain Glera blended with 10–15% Pinot Noir."
"Lambrusco (/læmˈbrʊskoʊ/; Italian: [lamˈbrusko]) is the name of both an Italian red wine grape and a wine made principally from said grape. The grapes and the wine originate from four zones in Emilia-Romagna and one in Lombardy―principally around the central provinces of Modena, Parma, Reggio-Emilia, and Mantua. The grape has a long winemaking history, with archaeological evidence indicating that the Etruscans cultivated the vine. In Roman times Lambrusco was highly valued for its productivity and high yields, with Cato the Elder stating that produce of two thirds of an acre could make enough wine to fill 300 amphoras. The most highly rated of its wines are the frizzante (slightly sparkling) red wines, designed to be drunk young, from one of the eight Lambrusco denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) regions: Colli di Parma Lambrusco, Lambrusco Grasparossa di Castelvetro, Lambrusco di Sorbara, Lambrusco Salamino di Santa Croce, Reggiano Lambrusco, Colli di Scandiano e Canossa Lambrusco, Modena Lambrusco, and Lambrusco Mantovano. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s sweet Lambrusco was the biggest selling import wine in the United States. During that time the wine was also produced in a white and rosé style made by limiting the skin contact with the must."
"Ribolla Gialla (also known as Ribolla, in Slovenian: Rumena rebula, in Croatian: Jarbola) is a white wine grape grown most prominently in the region of northeast Italy. The grape is also found in Slovenia where it is known as Rebula. In Friuli, the grape thrives in the region around Rosazzo and Gorizia. In Slovenia, the grape is grown prominently in the Brda region. The grape is not related to the Friuli red wine grape Schioppettino, which is also known as Ribolla Nera. The obscure, lower quality Ribola Verde grape is a mutated version that is not widely used."
"Sangiovese (/ˌsændʒoʊˈveɪzi/, also UK: /-dʒioʊˈ-, -dʒiəˈ-/, US: /ˌsɑːn-, ˌsɑːndʒoʊˈviːz, -ˈviːs/, Italian: [sandʒoˈveːze]) is a red Italian wine grape variety that derives its name from the Latin sanguis Jovis, ""the blood of Jupiter"". Though it is the grape of most of central Italy from Romagna down to Lazio (the most widespread grape in Tuscany), Campania and Sicily, outside Italy it is most famous as the only component of Brunello di Montalcino and Rosso di Montalcino and the main component of the blends Chianti, Carmignano, Vino Nobile di Montepulciano and Morellino di Scansano, although it can also be used to make varietal wines such as Sangiovese di Romagna and the modern ""Super Tuscan"" wines like Tignanello. Sangiovese was already well known by the 16th century. Recent DNA profiling by José Vouillamoz of the Istituto Agrario di San Michele all’Adige suggests that Sangiovese's ancestors are Ciliegiolo and Calabrese Montenuovo. The former is well known as an ancient variety in Tuscany, the latter is an almost-extinct relic from Calabria, the toe of Italy. At least fourteen Sangiovese clones exist, of which Brunello is one of the best regarded. An attempt to classify the clones into Sangiovese grosso (including Brunello) and Sangiovese piccolo families has gained little evidential support. Young Sangiovese has fresh fruity flavours of strawberry and a little spiciness, but it readily takes on oaky, even tarry, flavours when aged in barrels. While not as aromatic as other red wine varieties such as Pinot noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Syrah, Sangiovese often has a flavour profile of sour red cherries with earthy aromas and tea leaf notes. Wines made from Sangiovese usually have medium-plus tannins and high acidity."
"Muscat of Alexandria is a white wine grape that is a member of the Muscat family of Vitis vinifera. It is considered an ""ancient vine"", and wine experts believe it is one of the oldest genetically unmodified vines still in existence. The grape originated in North Africa, and the name is probably derived from its association with Ancient Egyptians who used the grape for wine making. It is also a table grape used for eating and raisins. Muscat of Alexandria is cultivated very heavily on the island of Lemnos in the North Eastern Aegean region of Greece, and reputedly Cleopatra drank muscat wine from there. In Italy wine is made from the grape on the island of Pantelleria, and it is grown in Calabria and Sicily where it is known as Zibibbo. In Spain, the grape is the sixth most planted white grape variety with 10,318 hectares (25,496 acres) grown in 2015, mainly in Málaga, Alicante, Valencia, and the Canary Islands. It is an important grape in the Australian and South African wine industry."
"Pinot gris, pinot grigio (US: /ˈpiːnoʊ ˈɡriːdʒioʊ, -dʒoʊ/, UK: /ˈɡrɪdʒioʊ/) or Grauburgunder is a white wine grape variety of the species Vitis vinifera. Thought to be a mutant clone of the pinot noir variety, it normally has a grayish-blue fruit, accounting for its name but the grapes can have a brownish pink to black and even white appearance. The word pinot could have been given to it because the grapes grow in small pine cone-shaped clusters. The wines produced from this grape also vary in color from a deep golden yellow to copper and even a light shade of pink, and it is one of the more popular grapes for skin-contact wine. Pinot gris is grown around the globe with the ""spicy"" full-bodied Alsatian and lighter-bodied, more acidic Italian styles being most widely recognized. The Alsatian style, often duplicated in New World wine regions such as Marlborough, Tasmania, South Australia, Washington, Oregon and South Africa tend to have moderate to low acidity, higher alcohol levels and an almost ""oily"" texture that contributes to the full-bodied nature of the wine. The flavors can range from ripe tropical fruit notes of melon and mango to some botrytis-influenced flavors. In Italy, Pinot grigio grapes are often harvested early to retain the refreshing acidity and minimize some of the overt-fruitiness of the variety, creating a more neutral flavor profile. This style is often imitated in other Old World wine regions, such as Germany where the grape is known as Ruländer or more commonly Grauburgunder."
Tintilia is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Molise region of east-central Italy. A red wine made from the grape was classified as Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) in 2011.
"Dolcetto (UK: /dɒlˈtʃɛtoʊ/ dol-CHET-oh, US: /doʊlˈ-/ dohl-, Italian: [dolˈtʃetto]) is a black Italian wine grape variety widely grown in the Piedmont region of northwest Italy. The Italian word dolcetto means ""little sweet one"", but it is not certain that the name originally carried any reference to the grape’s sugar levels: it is possible that it derives from the name of the hills where the vine is cultivated. In any case the wines produced are nearly always dry. They can be tannic and fruity with moderate, or decidedly low, levels of acidity and are typically meant to be consumed within a few years after release."
"Ruché (pronounced in English /ˈruːkeɪ/ ROO-kay, Italian: [ruˈke]) is a red Italian wine grape variety from the Piedmont region. It is largely used in making Ruché di Castagnole Monferrato, a small production red varietal wine which was granted Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) status by presidential decree on October 22, 1987, and was granted the more prestigious Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) status in 2010. The current DOC recognized area of production for the wine covers only about 100 acres (40 hectares) of vines around the villages of Castagnole Monferrato, Refrancore, Grana, Montemagno, Viarigi, Scurzolengo and Portacomaro. Ruché di Castagnole Monferrato is, therefore, one of the lowest production varietal wines in Italy. The grape is also grown to some extent in the neighboring province of Alessandria. There is some debate about the origins of the Ruché grape. One theory is that the variety is indigenous to the hills northeast of the town of Asti. Another theory is that the grape is a local variation on a French import. It has been grown in the area for at least one hundred years but has only recently been marketed and consumed outside of the immediate vicinity of its production. Ruché di Castagnole Monferrato tends to be medium bodied with notes of pepper and wild berries and floral aromas on the nose. The wine is often characterized by moderate acidity and soft tannins. In the Piedmont region it is often paired with slow-cooked beef, northern Italian cheeses and mushrooms."
"Trollinger, Schiava, or Vernatsch, is a red German/Italian wine grape variety that was likely first originally cultivated in the wine regions of South Tyrol and Trentino, but today is almost exclusively cultivated on steep, sunny locations in the Württemberg wine region of Baden-Württemberg. It is primarily known under the synonyms Trollinger in Germany, Vernatsch in South Tyrol and Schiava in other Italian regions. As a table grape the variety is sometimes known as Black Hamburg, which is commonly confused with the similar synonym for Black Muscat—a variety that is actually a cross of Trollinger and Muscat of Alexandria. According to wine expert Oz Clarke, Trollinger has moderate acidity and tends to produce light bodied wines with fruity strawberry and subtle smokey notes."
"Lagrein (pronounced lah-GRAH’EEN, lah-GRINE or lah-GRI’NE) is a red wine grape variety native to the valleys of South Tyrol, northern Italy. Along with Marzemino, it is a descendant of Teroldego, and related to Syrah, Pinot noir and Dureza. The name suggests its origins lie in the Lagarina valley of Trentino. It was mentioned as early as in the 17th century, in records of the Muri Abbey near Bolzano."
"Welschriesling is a white wine grape variety, unrelated to the Rhine Riesling, that is grown throughout Central Europe."
"Gewürztraminer (German: [ɡəˈvʏʁtstʁaˈmiːnɐ]) is an aromatic wine grape variety, used in white wines, and performs best in cooler climates. In English, it is sometimes referred to colloquially as Gewürz (/ɡəˈvʊərts, -ˈvɜːrts/; although this is never the case in German, because ""Gewürz"" means ""herb"" or ""spice""), and in English and French it is written Gewurztraminer (without the umlaut). Gewürztraminer is a variety with a pink to red skin colour, which makes it a ""white wine grape"" as opposed to the blue to black-skinned varieties commonly referred to as ""red wine grapes"". The variety has high natural sugar and the wines are white and usually off-dry, with a flamboyant bouquet of lychees. Indeed, Gewürztraminer and lychees share the same aroma compounds. Dry Gewürztraminers may also have aromas of roses, passion fruit and floral notes. It is not uncommon to notice some spritz (fine bubbles on the inside of the glass). Gewürztraminer's sweetness may offset the spice in Southeast Asian cuisine."
"Ramandolo is a sweet white Italian wine from the village of the same name which is situated in the hills near Nimis in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia wine region of northeast Italy. It is made from a local variety of the Verduzzo grape. Since 2001, Ramandolo has been produced as a DOCG wine. Prior to this it was a subzone of the Colli Orientali del Friuli DOC."
"Refosco is a very old family of dark-skinned grape varieties native to the Venetian zone and neighbouring areas of Friuli, Gavi, Trentino, Istria, and Karst Plateau. It is considered autochthonous in these regions. The wines this grape yields can be quite powerful and tannic, with a deep violet color and a slight bitterness. On the palate, there are strong currant, wild berry and plum flavors. The wine can stand some aging (depending on variety), and after a period of four-to-ten years, it achieves a floral quality as well. Refosco should be served at 16 °C (60.8 °F), or if it is particularly rich in tannin, at 18 °C (64.4 °F). It goes best with charcuterie, game, and grilled poultry."
"Lagarino bianco is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol wine region of northeast Italy. It was once thought that the grape was a white berry color mutation or offspring of South Tyrolean grape Lagrein with a weiss Lagrien grape variety reportedly growing near the commune of Bolzano in 1318 but DNA profiling conducted in the early 21st century has shown that the two grape varieties are distinct with no direct relationship to each other. Lagarino bianco was nearly extinct until viticulturists at the Istituto Agrario di San Michele all’Adige (IASMA) in San Michele all'Adige worked to revive the variety and since 2007 the grape has been listed in the official Italian registry of grape variety. While the grape is not widely cultivated, some producers in the Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol region are producing varietal examples of Lagarino bianco."
"A rosé (from French, rosé [ʁoze]) is a type of wine that incorporates some of the color from the grape skins, but not enough to qualify it as a red wine. It may be the oldest known type of wine, as it is the most straightforward to make with the skin contact method. The pink color can range from a pale ""onion-skin"" orange to a vivid near-purple, depending on the grape varieties used and winemaking techniques. Usually, the wine is labelled rosé in French, Portuguese, and English-speaking countries, rosado in Spanish, or rosato in Italian. There are three major ways to produce rosé wine: skin contact, saignée, and blending. Rosé wines can be made still, semi-sparkling or sparkling and with a wide range of sweetness levels from highly dry Provençal rosé to sweet White Zinfandels and blushes. Rosé wines are made from a wide variety of grapes and can be found all around the globe. When rosé wine is the primary product, it is produced with the skin contact method. Black-skinned grapes are crushed and the skins are allowed to remain in contact with the juice for a short period, typically two to twenty hours. The grape must is then pressed and the skins discarded, rather than left in contact throughout fermentation (as with red wine making). The longer the skins are left in contact with the juice, the more intense the color of the final wine. When a winemaker desires to impart more tannin and color to red wine, some of the pink juice from the must can be removed at an early stage in what is known as the Saignée (from French bleeding) method. The red wine remaining in the vats is intensified as a result of the bleeding, because the volume of juice in the must is reduced, and the must involved in the maceration becomes more concentrated. The pink juice that is removed can be fermented separately to produce rosé. The simple mixing of red wine into white wine to impart color is uncommon and is discouraged in most wine growing regions, especially in France, where it is forbidden by law, except for Champagne. Even in Champagne, several high-end producers do not use this method but rather the saignée method."
"Catawba is a red American grape variety used for wine as well as juice, jams and jellies. The grape can have a pronounced musky or ""foxy"" flavor. Grown predominantly on the East Coast of the United States, this purplish-red grape is a likely cross of the native American Vitis labrusca and the Vitis vinifera cultivar Semillon. Its exact origins are unclear but it seems to have originated somewhere on the East coast from the Carolinas to Maryland. Catawba played an important role in the early history of American wine. During the early to mid-19th century, it was the most widely planted grape variety in the country and was the grape behind Nicholas Longworth's acclaimed Ohio sparkling wines that were distributed as far away as California and Europe. Catawba is a late-ripening variety, ripening often weeks after many other labrusca varieties and, like many vinifera varieties, it can be susceptible to fungal grape diseases such as powdery mildew."
Dobričić is an ancient red wine grape variety from the island of Šolta off the Dalmatian coast in Croatia. Some areas still grow Dobričić – many vineyards were left to grow wild following World War II.
"Grenache (/ɡrəˈnæʃ/) or Garnacha (IPA: [ɡaɾˈnatʃa]) is one of the most widely planted red wine grape varieties in the world. It ripens late, so it needs hot, dry conditions such as those found in Spain, where the grape most likely originated. It is also grown in the Italian island of Sardinia, the south of France, Australia, and California's Monterey AVA and San Joaquin Valley. It is generally spicy, berry-flavored and soft on the palate and produces wine with a relatively high alcohol content, but it needs careful control of yields for best results. Characteristic flavor profiles on Grenache include red fruit flavors (raspberry and strawberry) with a subtle, white pepper spice note. Grenache wines are highly prone to oxidation, with even young examples having the potential to show browning (or ""bricking"") coloration that can be noticed around the rim when evaluating the wine at an angle in the glass. As Grenache ages the wines tend to take on more leather and tar flavors. Wines made from Grenache tend to lack acid, tannin and color, and it is often blended with other varieties such as Syrah, Carignan, Tempranillo, and Cinsaut. In Spain, there are monovarietal wines made of Garnacha tinta (red Grenache), notably in the southern Aragon wine regions of Calatayud, Carinena and Campo de Borja, but it is also used in blends, as in some Rioja wines with tempranillo. Grenache is the dominant variety in most Southern Rhône wines, especially in Châteauneuf-du-Pape, where it is typically over 80% of the blend. In Australia it is typically blended in ""GSM"" blends with Syrah (commonly known as Shiraz in that country) and Mourvèdre with old vine examples in McLaren Vale. In Italy, the Sardinian D.O.C. wine Cannonau di Sardegna is by law 90% local Grenache (Cannonau in Sardinian). Grenache is also used to make rosé wines in France and Spain, notably those of the Tavel district in the Côtes du Rhône and those of the Navarre region. And the high sugar levels of Grenache have led to extensive use in fortified wines, including the red vins doux naturels of Roussillon such as Banyuls, and as the basis of most Australian fortified wine."
"Zinfandel (also known as Primitivo) is a variety of black-skinned wine grape. The variety is grown in over 10 percent of California vineyards. DNA analysis has revealed that it is genetically equivalent to the Croatian grapes Crljenak Kaštelanski and Tribidrag, as well as to the Primitivo variety traditionally grown in Apulia (the ""heel"" of Italy), where it was introduced in the 18th century. The grape found its way to the United States in the mid-19th century, where it became known by variations of a name applied to a different grape, likely ""Zierfandler"" from Austria. The grapes typically produce a robust red wine, although in the United States a semi-sweet rosé (blush-style) wine called White Zinfandel has six times the sales of the red wine. The grape's high sugar content can be fermented into levels of alcohol exceeding 15 percent. The taste of the red wine depends on the ripeness of the grapes from which it is made. Red berry fruit flavors like raspberry predominate in wines from cooler areas, whereas blackberry, anise and pepper notes are more common in wines made in warmer areas and in wines made from the earlier-ripening Primitivo clone."
"Babić is a native Croatian red wine grape common to the Northern Dalmatia region. Typically grown in and around the towns of Šibenik and Primošten, it can also be found on some Croatian islands such as Korčula. While officially listed as a National Cultivar in Croatia (NN 159/04), the name of this grape is also a common Croatian family name."
"Plavac Mali (Croatian pronunciation: [plǎːʋat͡s mǎli]), a cross between Crljenak Kaštelanski (ancestral Zinfandel) and Dobričić grapes, is the primary red wine grape grown along the Dalmatian coast of Croatia. The name refers to the small blue grapes that the vines produce: in Croatian plavo means blue; mali means small. Plavac Mali is known for producing rich, flavorful wines that are high in both alcohol (typically 12% but up to 17%) and grape tannins. Common flavors and aromas include blackberries, dark cherries, pepper, and spices. Croatian wines from this grape include the reds from Dingač and Postup on the Pelješac peninsula, Hvar island, Brač island, and the rosé Opol (a vinification style). The wines can be created as dry, such as Dingač and Postup, as well as semi-dry."
"Drnekuša is an ancient red wine grape variety from the Dalmatian coast in Croatia. Rarely found, when it is grown, it is typically blended with Plavac Mali, giving a deep, ruby coloration typically to when Syrah is used as a blend. On the island of Hvar, one winery will sometimes release a wine that is 100% Drnekuša but only when the growing season is the most optimal. A bisexual flower, Drnekuša starts producing in its third year of growth. It prefers deep, fertile, permeable soils to grow in, such as those found in the Stari Grad Plain. Its resistance to mildew and mold is very weak and as such, the vines need to planted in a warm climate. This also results in the grape having a thin skin that breaks easily."
Debit is a white wine grape variety grown primarily along the Northern & Central Dalmatian Coast of Croatia. The fruit are medium-sized golden yellow color and in clusters of medium size or large.
"Pošip is an autochthonous white wine grape that is primarily grown in the Dalmatian region of Croatia on the island of Korčula, although small amounts are also being grown on the Pelješac Peninsula. While found in many areas around the Korčula, the primary and most productive growing regions are in and around the municipalities of Čara and Smokvica. Despite growing the same grapes, each region has their own distinct characteristics. There are limited amounts of red wines (primarily Plavac Mali) grown on Korčula, but the main focus of the entire island is on this grape as well the lesser-produced Grk. Pošip is generally light bodied, around 12-13% in alcohol and best had at the cool temperature of 14 °C. It is a natural companion for fish dishes as well as Pršut and the light-bodied cheeses that Croatia produces such as Paški sir."
"Bogdanuša is a white grape variety, which is grown on the Croatian island of Hvar, where it originated on the Stari Grad Plain. Wines from this grape tend to be dry with a green-yellow to golden color and from 12% alcohol on up. Premium quality Bogdanuša wines are produced by Dalmacijavino, and Plančić Winery."
"Grk Bijeli or Grk is a white grape variety used for wine. It is in particularly found in the village of Lumbarda on the island of Korčula in Croatia, where it is used to make Grk wine. The Croatian word grk means 'bitter', but the wine is dry, high in acidity, somewhat aromatic, with hints of pine. The Grk vine only has female flowers. To ensure pollination it must be co-planted with another grape variety with male flowers, ratio about 10-20 percent, usually Plavac Mali."
"Maraština (Rukatac, Maraškin, Mareština, Krizol, Višana) is an indigenous white grape variety from the Dalmatian coast, recommended for all Dalmatian sub-regions, and the Croatian Coast, except Istria. On the island of Cres, it is known as krizol, and in other parts of Dalmatia it is known as rukatac. As it is widely grown, other local names exist, for example đurđevina, kačebelić, kače-debić, kukuruz, mareština, and marinkuša. DNA analysis has shown that maraština is closely related to the Italian variety Malvasia del Chianti. Croatian dessert wine prošek also uses this grape."
"Vugava (also known as Bugava) is a white grape variety mostly cultivated on the Croatian island of Vis in central Dalmatia. The Vugava is often compared to the Viognier and might be its ancestor. It is a very old variety, believed to be over 2,000 years old and to have been cultivated by the ancient Greek colonists when the island was known as Issa, or introduced by the Roman army. There is even a debate on whether Agatharchides was referring to Vugava when he wrote: ""On the island of Vis is a wine produced that no other wine equals"". Vugava requires a lot of attention and needs to be harvested at the right time. Although recognized as a high quality grape variety, it is usually used for blending with other varieties such as Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, or Sauvignon Blanc. This is because in its traditional form, Vugava wine has a very high sugar content and overripe aromas. Vugava wines can best be described as having sweet and fruity flavors which may be lacking in terms of acidity levels. Wines produced from Vugava grapes are best paired with savory foods rich in flavor, such as fish and poultry dishes."
"Criolla is a term used in the name of several grape varieties, in particular varieties found in Argentina, the most common of which is Criolla Grande and another which is Criolla Chica. The term Criollas is also used collectively to refer to a group of presumably American-born cultivars the European grapevine Vitis vinifera, much in the same way as many other uses of the term Criollo. The Criollas group of grape varieties also include e.g. the three Argentine Torrontés varieties (Torrontés Mendocino, Torrontés Riojano, and Torrontés Sanjuanino) and (also known as Moscatel Amarillo). A common feature of the Criollas group is a better resistance to certain types of environmental stress, such as low water availability and high salt concentrations, than many traditional European grape varieties. Presumably, these varieties have been selected by pioneering viticulturists for these properties, which made them easier to grow in early South American vineyards."
"The Champanel grape is an American hybrid developed by Thomas Volney Munson of Texas. Champanel is a cross of the two grape varieties Vitis champinii X Worden, a Concord seedling. It grows vigorously, is resistant to root rot, Pierces disease and produces clusters of fruit resistant to rot and mildew. Although well adapted to a wide range of growing conditions, Champanel produces fruit with aroma characteristic of its Concord parentage and is not often seen commercially. Rather, Champanel is most often used as grafting material for Vitis vinifera (wine grapes), to provide disease resistant root stock. Jim Kamas writes, ""Although the cause of vine death from [Pierce disease] was not known to him, T.V. Munson realized that utilizing grape parents that survived local conditions was important in creating new, improved adapted grape varieties"" (Power). Munson not only developed a hybrid grape that is resistant to Pierce disease but that grows well in any soil type. The Champanel grapevine grows vigorously on any type of trellis it is placed under. The vine can be placed beside a fence so that the arms of the vine can run along it. Even though the vine grows vigorously, the Champanel grapevine is great for first time growers who want to add grapevines to their garden for the berries or for aesthetics. With the berries a grower can make jelly, juice or wine. This vine is excellent for growing up an arbor to provide shade in a growers back or front yard."
"Pinot (pronounced /ˈpiːnoʊ, piˈnoʊ/) is a Burgundian grape family."
The Pixie Grape is a new type of Vitis vinifera cultivar. The Pixie is a natural dwarf grapevine that is derived from the periclinal L1/L2 chimera Pinot Meunier. These dwarf grapevines tend to have short internodes and prefer to grow flowers instead of tendrils. They grow from 1 foot to 2 feet in height and produce clusters with a size on average of 4 inches. It is simple to cultivate in greenhouses and grows year round. Its purpose was to create an easy tool with which to conduct grapevine research. The grape was developed by grape rootstock breeder Dr. Peter Cousins of the USDA.
"Aramon or Aramon noir is a variety of red wine grape grown primarily in Languedoc-Roussillon in southern France. Between the late 19th century and the 1960s, it was France's most grown grape variety, but plantings of Aramon have been in continuous decline since the mid-20th century. Aramon has also been grown in Algeria, Argentina and Chile but nowhere else did it ever reach the popularity it used to have in the south of France. It is most noted for its very high productivity, and yields can reach levels as high as 400 hectolitres per hectare. The vine's resistance to oidium, phylloxera, and powdery mildew led to its reputation as workhorse grape that could be relied on by growers for dependable financial returns. However, when cropped at high yields, the resultant wines are very light red in color (but show a blue-black tinge), low in alcohol and extract and generally thin on character. Such Aramon wine is often blended with wine from grapes of darker color such as Alicante Bouschet and Grand Noir de la Calmette to darken the resulting wine. If planted on poor soils and pruned very severely to much smaller yields, it has been shown to be able to give concentrated wines with spicy, earthy, herbaceous, and somewhat rustic character. However, such Aramon wines are extremely rare, but some varietal wine is still produced in Languedoc. A viticultural drawback of Aramon is that it buds early and ripens late, which means that it only is suitable for growing in hotter regions, and that it is very sensitive to spring frost."
"Terret noir is a dark-skinned French wine grape variety grown primarily in the Rhône valley region of France. It is a mutation of the old Vitis vinifera vine Terret. It is a permitted blending grape for Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Like the related Terret gris and Terret blanc, the vine tends to bud late and grow vigorously. Terret noir produces a light color wine that is perfumed and tart. In 2007, there were 189 hectares (470 acres) of Terret noir in France. This was a steep decline from the 400 ha (1000 acres) plantings that the Institut national de l'origine et de la qualité (INAO) reported in 2000."
"Piquepoul, Picpoul, or Picapoll is a variety of wine grape grown primarily in the Rhone Valley and Languedoc regions of France as well as Catalonia, Spain. It exists both in dark-skinned (Piquepoul noir) and light-skinned (Piquepoul blanc) versions, as well as a very little grown Piquepoul gris. Piquepoul blanc is the most common of the Piquepouls, with 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres) cultivated in France in 2000, and an increasing trend. Piquepoul tends to bud late and has some sensitivity to powdery mildew."
"Bourboulenc is a white wine grape variety primarily grown in southern France. The variety is found in the regions Southern Rhône, Provence and Languedoc. Bourboulenc is a late-ripening grape variety with tight bunches of large grapes, that can be prone to rot in some years. Bourboulenc wine has a good acidity level, body, penetrating character, citrus aromas and a hint of smoke. However, if the grapes are picked too soon, the wines have a thin, neutral taste. In 2000, there were 800 hectares (2,000 acres) of Bourboulenc in France."
"Mavrodaphni, Mavrodaphne, or Mavrodafni (Greek: Μαυροδάφνη lit. 'black laurel') is both a black wine grape indigenous to the Achaea region in Northern Peloponnese, Greece, and the sweet, fortified wine first produced from it by Gustav Clauss in around 1850."
"Xinomavro (Greek: Ξινόμαυρο [ksiˈno̞mavro̞], lit. 'sour black') is the principal red wine grape of the uplands of Naousa in the regional unit of Imathia, and around Amyntaio, in Macedonia, Greece. This grape is primarily cultivated in Naousa, Goumenissa, Amyntaio, Rapsani, Trikomo, Siatista, Velventos, and, on a lesser scale, on Mount Athos, at Ossa, Ioannina, Magnesia, Kastoria and Trikala. In 2010, the total global cultivated area was 1,971 hectares (4,870 acres) and was entirely in Greece, but by 2013 this had grown to 2,239 hectares (5,530 acres) worldwide, with some initial plantings in Gansu, China."
"Agiorgitiko (Greek: Αγιωργίτικο; also known as Aghiorghitiko) is a red Greek wine grape variety that, as of 2012, was the most widely planted red grape variety in Greece, ahead of Xynomavro. The grape has traditionally been grown in the Nemea region of the Peloponnese but can be found throughout the country including Attikí (Attica) and Makedonía (Macedonia). One of the more commercially important indigenous Greek varieties, it can exhibit a wide range of characteristics, from soft to very tannic, depending on factors in the growing and winemaking processes. The grape is typically made as a varietal, though it is notably blended with Cabernet Sauvignon in the area around Metsovo to make the table wine traditionally called katoi. In the region of Nemea it is often made into rosés of oak-aged red wines. The wines are known for their high level of fruitiness but tend to lack some acidity and body. The red wine produced from the grape is characteristically spicy with notes of plum. It has low acidity but good fruitiness and coloring. Agiorgitiko is generally planted in dry, infertile soil to encourage the production of fewer but more concentrated grapes, ripening after mid-September."
"Aglianico (English: /ælˈjænɪkoʊ/ al-YAN-i-koh, Italian: [aʎˈʎaːniko]) is a black grape grown in the southern regions of Italy, mostly Basilicata and Campania. It is considered with Sangiovese and Nebbiolo to be one of the three greatest Italian varieties. Aglianico is sometimes called ""The Barolo of the South"" (il Barolo del Sud) due to its ability to produce highly refined, complex fine wines like the famous Piedmont wine, Barolo."
"Grechetto (Italian pronunciation: [greˈketto]) or Grechetto bianco is a white Italian wine grape variety of Greek origins. The grape is planted throughout central Italy, particularly in the Umbria region where it is used in the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) wine Orvieto and Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) wine Valdichiana Toscana. It is primarily a blending grape, though some varietal wine is also produced. Grechetto is commonly blended with Chardonnay, Malvasia, Trebbiano and Verdello. The grape's thick skin provides good resistance to downy mildew which can attack the grape late in the harvest season. This makes Grechetto a suitable blending grape in the production of Vin Santo."
"Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains is a white wine grape of Greek origin that is a member of the Muscat family of Vitis vinifera. Its name comes from its characteristic small berry size and tight clusters. It is known under a variety of local names such as Moscato bianco, Muscat blanc, Muscat Canelli, Muscat de Frontignan, Muscat de Lunel, Muscat d'Alsace, Muskateller, Moscatel de Grano Menudo, Moscatel rosé and Sárgamuskotály. While technically a white grape, there are strains of Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains vines that produce berries that are pink or reddish brown. The same vine could potentially produce berries of one color one year and a different color the next. These strains are more prevalent in Australia, where the grape is also known as Frontignac and Brown Muscat. South Africa's Muskadel strain tends to show the same darker characteristics. Variants where the differing grape colour is stable are typically classified as separate grape varieties Muscat Rouge à Petit Grains for red skin colour and Muscat Rose à Petit Grains for pink skin colour."
"Lagorthi is a white Greek wine grape, well known despite its fairly small planting. It produces a moderately aromatic wine with relatively low fruit and alcohol content. The variety is grown in only a few vineyards, mainly in northern Peloponnesus and on some Ionian islands. As it is sensitive to water stress, some plantings have been made further north, in Macedonia, to assess its suitability for cooler but wetter climates. It is however relatively vigorous and resistant to disease. The grapes, which mature late (around late September), have thick skins and a fairly low juice content, and have an unusual ability to mature fully even at low sugar levels. A handful of producers bottle well-regarded wines, including a few varietals. The pioneering producer in the quality wine market was , in the late 1980s."
"Vranac (pronounced [ʋrǎːnats]), Montenegrin and Serbian Cyrillic: Вранац) is a variety of grapes and a red wine from Montenegro, Dalmatia (in Croatia), Herzegovina, Kosovo and Macedonia. It is protected as intellectual property and Montenegrin geographical indication of origin since 1977. Vranac is considered the most important variety of grape in Montenegro and one of the most important in North Macedonia (where it is known as Vranec). Vranac berries are large and deeply colored, with its dark berries growing on moderately vigorous and very productive vines. The fruit is harvested by hand. Depending on the area, this harvest can begin from mid-September and continue into October. Young Vranac wines have a bright purple hue and a nose full of red berries and fruit jams. Its firm tannin structure provides crispness and richness, with medium to high levels of extraction and acidity. After a year or two of aging, the purple develops into an intense dark ruby and the nose develops a more complex aroma that can include hints of cinnamon, chocolate, liquorice, flowers, black fruits, herbs and even woods such as oak. The taste is subtle, round, and full. It loses its sharpness and develops a longer and smoother finish."
"Öküzgözü is a grape variety and a Turkish wine produced from this grape. The grape is one of the two native grape varieties of Elazığ province (the other one is Boğazkere), located on the Anatolian plateau at the north of the Taurus Mountains. The various sources of the Euphrates River in this region soften the normally harsh climate of Eastern Turkey. Öküzgözü has rounded, dark colored grapes, which are the largest among the grape varieties grown in Turkey. The Turkish word öküzgözü literally means ""ox eye""."
"Seibel grapes are a group of wine grape varieties which originated with the work of Albert Seibel crossing European grape with American grape species to increase disease resistance. They were planted widely in France during the 1950s but have seen decline in recent years because French wine law prohibits hybrid grapes in appellation wine. The grapes are still commonly used as blending grapes in table wine and mass commercial wines. New Zealand, England, and Canada also have plantings of Seibel grapes. Almost all of Albert Seibel’s hybrid grapes were descended from only four parent grapes: two European grapes (Vitis vinifera), Aramon and Alicante Bouchet; one wild American grape, Jaeger 70 (Vitis rupestris x Vitis lincecumii); and one rootstock, AxR1, which was created by crossing Aramon with a wild American V. rupestris. Although Seibel bred tens of thousands of grapes, he did so almost entirely by crossing and re-crossing his original varieties, all of which were descended from the original four vines, so the basic gene pool of his collection remained largely unchanged. Almost all later grapevine hybridizers, such as Bertille Seyve and his father-in-law Victor Villard, would simply breed one or two of Albert Seibel’s grapes together and name their creations after themselves, e.g., Seyve-Villard 5276 (“Seyval Blanc”)."
"Clinton is a red variety of hybrid grape. Its phylloxera resistance led to its being planted in small amounts in the eastern Alps, although it imparts a pronounced foxiness and dark red colour to wine made from its juice."
"Regent is a dark-skinned inter-specific hybrid grape variety, used for making wine. It has both European (Vitis vinifera) and American vine species in its pedigree and a broad resistance against the most significant fungal diseases which affect grapes, such as downy mildew."
"Rondo is a dark-skinned grape variety, used for making red wine. It is a hybrid grape or inter-specific crossing. It was created in 1964 by Professor Vilém Kraus in then-Czechoslovakia by crossing the varieties Zarya Severa (a hybrid which has Vitis amurensis in its pedigree) and St. Laurent. He offered it to Dr. Helmut Becker (1927-1990) of the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute who conducted further work on it, which explains why the grape is known under a Geisenheim designation. The variety was first planted for research and later in bigger scale in the mid 1980s by Thomas Walk Vineyard in Ireland under the name Amurensis Walk; it was named Rondo in 1997 (German Federal Office's Varieties Register). This very early maturing variety possesses high resistance against winter frost and downy mildew from its Asiatic Vitis amurensis parent. However annual treatments against powdery mildew may still be necessary in the vineyards. Rondo produces a ruby-red wine which is also used for blending. Rondo is cultivated in many locations in northern Europe where dark-skinned Vitis vinifera varieties are difficult to ripen properly, as it tends to yield good colour and aroma even in those locations. Rondo is cultivated in Rheinhessen and in many locations in northern Europe including Denmark, England, Ireland, Wales, the Netherlands and Sweden. In 2011 the British winery Denbies picked up a gold prize in the for their 2010 vintage Chalk Ridge Rose, a wine made entirely from Rondo grapes."
"Baco noir (pronounced BA-koh NWAHR) is a hybrid red wine grape variety produced by Francois Baco from a cross of Vitis vinifera var. Folle blanche, a French wine grape, and an unknown variety of Vitis riparia indigenous to North America."
"Chambourcin is a species of grapevines belonging to the Vitis genus in the flowering plant family Vitaceae. It is a French-American interspecific hybrid grape variety used for making wine. Its parentage is uncertain. The hybrid was produced by Joannes Seyve who often used Seibel hybrids produced in the 1860s. The grape has only been available since 1963; it has a good resistance to fungal disease, and is one of the parents of the new disease resistant variety, Regent, which is increasing in popularity among German grape growers.Chambourcin is considered a very productive grape with crop yields reported ranging from 11.1 tons per hectare to 17.3 tons per hectare in a study performed by Ohio State University."
"Norton, a grape cultivar believed to be largely derived from Vitis aestivalis, is grown in the Midwestern United States, Mid-Atlantic States, northeastern Georgia, and, most recently, in California. Norton was first cultivated in Richmond, Virginia, and is the official grape of the State of Missouri and is considered the cornerstone of the Missouri wine industry. Strong evidence indicates that Dr. Daniel Norton first purveyed the Norton cultivar during the early 19th century from his vineyards in Virginia, USA. Further evidence has been reported that Dr. Norton developed the cultivar from seeds from a now extinct variety with unconfirmed parentage, Bland, pollinated by a Vitis Aestivalis grapevine. In 2009, Riedel designed stemware specifically for wine made from the Norton grape. The glass was unveiled at Les Bourgeois Winery near Columbia, Missouri."
"Chelois (French: [ʃəlwa]) is a variety of hybrid grape used in the production of red wines. The fruit are small blue-black berries, which appear in compact, medium-sized clusters. Chelois is among the less hardy hybrids of red-wine grapes."
"Noiret is a hybrid grape variety for use in red wine production. It was developed and named by Cornell University researchers working at the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station, and was officially released on July 7, 2006."
"Corot noir is a Hybrid grape variety for use in red wine production. It was developed by grape breeder at the Cornell University New York State Agricultural Experiment Station and released on July 7, 2006. Corot noir is the result of a cross between hybrids and in 1970. It ripens mid-season to late-season, and according to Reisch, its wines ""are free of the hybrid aromas typical of many other red hybrid grapes, and can be used for varietal wine production or for blending. The distinctive red wine has a deep red color and attractive berry and cherry fruit aromas""."
"Couderc noir is a red wine hybrid grape that was formerly grown primarily in the South West France wine region and around the Gard département in the Languedoc-Roussillon region. The vine produces high yields and ripens late, creating a wine that is deeply colored with a distinct, earthy flavor. Couderc noir is normally used for mass commercial and table wines. The grape was planted throughout France following the devastation of the phylloxera epidemic in the late 19th century and until the 1970s there were more plantings of Couderc noir in France than Cabernet Sauvignon."
"De Chaunac is a French-American hybrid wine grape variety used to make red wines. It was developed by Albert Seibel c. 1860. It is also known as Seibel 9549 and is a cross of Seibel 5163 and possibly Seibel 793. The grape was named after Adhemar de Chaunac, a pioneer in the Ontario wine industry. De Chaunac is known to be early ripening, have a very vigorous growth habit and good resistance to powdery mildew and downy mildew. It is grown in varying amounts for wine production across the northeastern side of North America, especially in the winegrowing regions of New York, Pennsylvania, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Michigan, Ohio, and other northeastern winegrowing areas."
"Jaeger 70 (also known as Munson) is a hybrid of two American species of grape, Vitis lincecumii and Vitis rupestris developed by Hermann Jaeger (1844–1895), a Swiss-American who settled in Missouri. He named the successful hybrid for his friend and fellow grape breeder, T.V. Munson. However the grape has become better known by Jaeger's selection number, 70. The grape's primary importance is as the female progenitor of many French - American hybrid grapes in the breeding program run by viticulturist Albert Seibel."
"Lacrosse is a modern hybrid cultivar of wine grape, mostly grown in North America. It produces grapes suitable for making fruity white wines similar to Riesling or as a base for blended wines. The grapes also make a good seeded table grape for eating. It has the benefits of early ripening and when hardened properly in the fall it is winter hardy to at least -25° F. As such it best suited to growing in more northern climates and can be found grown in small regions of Ohio."
"Baco blanc or Baco 22A is a French-American hybrid grape variety. It is a cross of Folle blanche and the Noah grape, created in 1898 by the grape breeder . Folle blanche is its Vitis vinifera parent. Noah, its other parent, is itself a cross of Vitis labrusca and Vitis riparia. Baco blanc was developed to produce some of the same flavors as Folle blanche but without the susceptibility to American grape disease and phylloxera. In the 20th century it was widely planted in the Gascony region for uses in brandy production. Both Armagnac and Cognac (from the Charentes and Charente-Maritime districts north of Gascony) are brandies made from white grapes – Ugni blanc, Folle blanche and Colombard – but only Armagnac was permitted under French regulations to use Baco blanc and until the late 1970s, Baco blanc was the primary grape of Armagnac. Following the grape's decline in the late 20th century, there was some speculation about the future of the variety, especially after a 1992 Institut National des Appellations d'Origine (INAO) decree that all vines of Baco blanc were to be uprooted by 2010. However, advocates for the grape variety and its historical role in Armagnac were able to persuade French authorities to continue permitting its use in the distilled wines from the Armagnac region."
"Solaris is a variety of grape used for white wine. It was created in 1975 at the grape breeding institute in Freiburg, Germany by Norbert Becker."
"Vidal blanc (or simply Vidal) is a white hybrid grape variety produced from the Vitis vinifera variety Ugni blanc (also known as Trebbiano Toscano) and another hybrid variety, (Seibel 4986). It is a very winter-hardy variety that manages to produce high sugar levels in cold climates with moderate to high acidity. The grape was developed in the 1930s by French wine grape breeder ; his primary goal in developing the variety was for the production of Cognac in the Charente-Maritime region of western France. However, due to its winter hardiness this grape variety is cultivated most extensively in the Canadian wine regions of Ontario, British Columbia and Nova Scotia where it is often used for ice wine production as a permitted grape of the Vintners Quality Alliance. It is also grown widely throughout the United States where it is used to produce both dry and sweet wines in the Finger Lakes AVA of New York, , Outer Coastal Plain AVA of Southern New Jersey, Michigan, Virginia, Missouri and other states. The grape is also grown just 500 miles south of the Arctic Circle in Sweden where it is also used to make ice wine. The wine produced from Vidal blanc tends to be very fruity, with aroma notes of grapefruit and pineapple. Due to its high acidity and sugar potential, it is particularly suited to sweeter, dessert wines. In particular, because of the tough outer skin of the fruit, it is well adapted for the production of ice wine. It is somewhat resistant to downy mildew but is very susceptible to other viticultural hazards such as coulure and powdery mildew."
"Seyval blanc (or Seyve-Villard hybrid number 5276) is a hybrid wine grape variety used to make white wines. Its vines ripen early, are productive and are suited to fairly cool climates. Seyval blanc is grown mainly in England, the United States east coast (specifically the Finger Lakes region of upstate New York, regions in Ohio and Virginia), in the Pacific Northwest (Oregon), as well as to a lesser extent in Canada. Seyval blanc was created either by , or his son-in-law Villard, as a cross of Seibel 5656 and (Seibel 4986), and was used to create the hybrid grape St. Pepin. Seyve and Villard used the same Rayon d'Or x Seibel 5656 crossing to produce the red wine grape Seyval noir. Since it contains some non-vinifera genes, it is outlawed by the EU authorities for quality wine production, which was an issue of conflict with the English wine industry."
"Chardonel is a late ripening white wine hybrid grape which can produce a high quality wine with varietal character. It is a result of a cross made by the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station of the popular French American hybrid Seyval and the classic vitis vinifera Chardonnay. It is distinguished by its superior wine quality combined with high productivity and cold hardiness superior to its acclaimed parent Chardonnay. The vine is vigorous and productive, producing green grapes with large clusters."
"Vignoles is a complex hybrid wine grape variety that was developed by originally named Ravat 51. According to Ravat, ""Ravat 51"" was the result of a cross made in 1930 using the complex hybrid wine grape Seibel 6905 (also known as Le Subereux) and a clone of Pinot Noir known as . Originally named ""Vignoles"" by the Finger Lakes Wine Growers Association in 1970, genetic testing has recently proved that Vignoles does not share any major genetic markers in common with Seibel 6905 or Pinot Noir. Thus, Vignoles is unrelated to the ""Ravat 51"" grapevine that was imported into the US in 1949 and the parentage of Vignoles is currently unknown. Viticulturally, Vignoles is described as moderately vigorous with moderate yields, late season bud break, an upright and open growth habit, small very compact bunches that are highly susceptible to Botrytis bunch rot, an average of 105 days from bloom to harvest, high sugar with high acid at maturity, average overall disease resistance, and moderate winter hardiness (−10 to −15 °F (−23 to −26 °C)). Enologically, Vignoles is often prized for its ability to produce balanced and fruity late-harvest style sweet white wines, including ice wine, although Vignoles is also used to produce fruity dry and off-dry white wines as well. In the United States, Vignoles is most commonly grown in New York state's Finger Lakes region, and in the Midwest including Missouri, Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, Iowa and Kentucky."
"Valvin muscat is a hybrid grape variety for use in white wine production. It was developed by grape breeder at the Cornell University New York State Agricultural Experiment Station and released on July 7, 2006. Valvin muscat is the result of a cross between Muscat Ottonel (vitis vinifera) and hybrid (Couderc 299-35). It has distinct muscat grape characteristics."
"Cayuga White is a mid-season ripening wine grape developed from crosses of the Vitis labrusca hybrids Schuyler and Seyval Blanc at Cornell University's New York State Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, New York. It is a hardy vine with some bunch-rot disease resistance. In warmer climates it should be picked at lower sugars to avoid overripe, sometimes labrusca-like, flavors; however this has not been observed in cooler climates such as the Finger Lakes and Pacific Northwest, where desirable, Riesling-type flavors are tasted in fully ripe Cayuga fruit. Picked at the proper time, it can produce a very nice sparkling wine with good acid balance, structure, and pleasant aromas, or a fruity white wine similar to a Riesling or Viognier. One advantage of Cayuga is that, if harvested unripe (e.g., in a shorter summer in cool climates), it can still make a good wine, albeit one with more green apple flavors in that case. This grape, when grown on mature vines in fertile soil, can produce astonishing yields. If allowed to set fully on thirty-year-old vines in Aurora, Oregon, Cayuga's yield has been measured at over 13 tons per acre, though in that case a ""green harvest"" (removing much of the fruit before the final phase of the ripening cycle) is advised, so that the vine can more fully ripen the remaining fruit. Cayuga is relatively easy to make wine from. In cooler climates, it retains enough acid that a residual sugar level is advised, in order to achieve balance in the palate. Cayuga is grown in small regions in Ohio. In one informal survey of grape breeders who grow hybrid grapes and make wine from them, Cayuga was the most-popular answer to the question ""Which hybrid grape is the easiest to grow and make good wine from?"" It can also be seen in the vineyards in Rhode Island, such as Greenvale, a similar climate to the Finger Lakes for wine grape growing."
"St. Pepin is a modern hybrid variety of wine grape, mostly grown in North America. It produces grapes suitable for making fruity white wines similar to Riesling or as a base for blended wines. The grapes also make a good seeded table grape for eating. It has the benefits of early ripening and when hardened properly in the fall it is winter hardy to at least −25 °F (−32 °C). As such, it best suited to growing in more northern climates. St. Pepin was breed by Elmer Swenson c. 1970 and released in 1986. It is a hybrid of the male Seyval blanc crossed to a seedling of Minnesota 78 by Seibel 1000 (a.k.a. Rosette). Unlike most modern grapes, it is a pistillate female and so needs to be planted next to male vines from a close sibling variety to achieve pollination."
"Kay Gray was developed by the Wisconsin grape breeder Elmer Swenson c. 1980 and is named after a family friend. It is a seedling of Swenson's own ES 217 (a cross of MN 78 and ). Swenson collected open-pollinated seeds from this vine, and one seedling eventually became Kay Gray. Because of this, the male parent is unknown, though Swenson suspected it might be a nearby vine of Onaka, an old South Dakota cultivar. Kay Gray itself is female and requires a pollen source in order to set fruit. In some environments it can produce an odd flavored wine that is vastly improved by modest levels of blending. Had it not been for its exceptional disease resistance and winter hardiness it probably would not have been selected. In subsequent years Swenson used this grape as a parent for the more conventionally flavored cultivars '' and ''."
"Traminette is a cross of the French American hybrid Joannes Seyve 23.416 and the German Vitis vinifera cultivar Gewürztraminer made by Herb C. Barrett ca. 1965 at the University of Illinois, Urbana/Champaign. His intention was to produce a large clustered table grape with the flavor of Gewürztraminer. He sent the cross to the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station grape breeding program at Cornell for development when he departed from Illinois. Traminette was found to have excellent wine quality, combined with good productivity, partial resistance to several fungal diseases, and cold hardiness superior to its acclaimed parent, Gewürztraminer, while retaining a similar character. Traminette produces solid yields, ranging in studies from 12-22 lbs/vine average. Traminette wine has been chosen by the Indiana Wine Grape Council as the signature wine of the state. The wine is also produced in some regions of Ohio, the Yadkin Valley AVA of North Carolina, the Finger Lakes AVA of New York, and parts of Virginia, as well as in Pennsylvania and Southern New England."
"Beta is a winter-hardy variety of North American grape derived from a cross of the Vitis labrusca-based cultivar Concord and a selection of Vitis riparia, the wild riverbank grape, called . It is an extremely cold-hardy grape that is self-fertile. This variety is grown successfully in Finland and was widely planted in Minnesota in the early 20th century. It ripens in late September in New York State. It bears dark, blue-black fruit that is used for jellies, fruit juices, etc. but rarely for wine."
"Teinturier (French: to dye or to stain) grapes are grapes whose flesh and juice is red in colour due to anthocyanin pigments accumulating within the pulp of the grape berry itself. In most cases, anthocyanin pigments are confined to the outer skin tissue only, and the squeezed grape juice of most dark-skinned grape varieties is clear. The red color of red wine comes from anthocyanins extracted from the macerated (crushed) skins, over a period of days during the fermentation process."
"Black Muscat (or Muscat Hamburg) is a red Vitis vinifera grape variety derived from the crossing of the Schiava Grossa and Muscat of Alexandria by Seward Snow, Head Gardener to Earl de Grey at Wrest Park Bedfordshire England in 1850 according to the Vitis International Variety Catalogue. It is known under a variety of local names such as Golden Hamburg, and Black Hamburg in the US; Muscat de Hambourg (or Hamburgh) in France; Moscato di Amburgo in Italy; and Muscat Gamburgskiy in Russia and former Soviet Union countries. Confusingly, Black Hamburg is also used as a synonym for its maternal parent. It is commonly produced as table wine but in California's Central Valley it has been used in the production of dessert wine. As a dessert wine it can be highly aromatic with a rich coloring. In the US it is grown in wine appellations in California, Virginia, Oregon, Texas, and Washington. In Canada, it is also found on Vancouver Island. In France, the grape is used chiefly as dessert grape including AOC varieties such as Muscat du Ventoux. In Eastern Europe, the grape produces a light, dry red wine. It is also starting to gain popularity as a table wine component in China. Horticulturist Walter Clore has postulated that this grape might have been one of the first Vitis vinifera varieties planted in Washington State in the early 19th century."
"Incrocio Manzoni or Manzoni grapes is a family of grape varieties named after Professor Luigi Manzoni (1888-1968) of Italy's oldest school of oenology located in Conegliano, in the Veneto region. Manzoni created the new grape varieties by selecting, crossing and grafting vines from various vineyards during the 1920s and 1930s. The family includes both white and red grape varieties. Although most Manzonis are grown in northeastern Italy, they are mainly grown in the Piave area of Province of Treviso and are only now starting to be sold commercially in Europe and the United States."
"Carignan (also known as Mazuelo, Bovale Grande, Cariñena, Carinyena, Samsó, Carignane, and Carignano) is a red grape variety of Spanish origin that is more commonly found in French wine but is widely planted throughout the western Mediterranean and around the globe. Along with Aramon, it was considered one of the main grapes responsible for France's wine lake and was a substantial producer in jug wine production in California's Central Valley but in recent years, it has been reborn as a flagship wine for many cellars in the south of France as well as in Catalonia. Ampelographers believe that the grape likely originated in Cariñena, Aragon and was later transplanted to Sardinia, elsewhere in Italy, France, Algeria, and much of the New World. The variety was historically a component of Rioja's red wine blend. The grape's prominence in France hit a high point in 1988 when it accounted for 167,000 hectares (410,000 acres) and was France's most widely planted grape variety. That year, in a drive to increase the overall quality of European wine and to reduce the growing wine lake phenomenon, the European Union started an aggressive vine pull scheme where vineyard owners were offered cash subsidies in exchange for pulling up their vines. Out of all the French wine varieties, Carignan was the most widely affected dropping by 2000 to 95,700 ha (236,000 acres) and being surpassed by Merlot as the most widely planted grape. The popularity of Carignan was largely tied to its ability to produce very large yields in the range of 200 hl/ha (11 tons/acre). The vine does face significant viticultural hazards with significant sensitivity to several viticultural hazards including rot, powdery mildew, downy mildew, and grape worms. Carignan is a late budding and ripening grape which requires a warm climate in order to achieve full physiological ripeness. The vine also develops very thick stalk around the grape clusters which makes mechanical harvesting difficult. It has an upright growth habit and can be grown without a trellis. A white grape mutation known as Carignan blanc and a pink-berried Carignan gris also exists in Roussillon in small plantings of around 411 hectares (1,020 acres) and 1 hectare (2.5 acres), respectively, reported in 2008."
"Terret is an ancient Vitis vinifera vine that, like the parent Pinot vine of Pinot noir's history, mutated over the course of thousands of years into grape varieties of several color. Originating in the Languedoc-Roussillon wine of southern France, the descendants of Terret now include the red wine variety Terret noir, the white Terret blanc and the light-skinned Terret gris. For years, the light skin varieties of the Terrets were grown together as field blends and used in Vermouth production. The dark-skinned Terret noir was more highly valued as a permitted variety in the notable Rhône wine of Châteauneuf-du-Pape as well as in the Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC)s of Corbières AOC and Minervois AOC in the Languedoc."
"Cabernet Sauvignon (French: [kabɛʁnɛ soviˈɲɔ̃]) is one of the world's most widely recognized red wine grape varieties. It is grown in nearly every major wine producing country among a diverse spectrum of climates from Australia and British Columbia, Canada to Lebanon's Beqaa Valley. Cabernet Sauvignon became internationally recognized through its prominence in Bordeaux wines where it is often blended with Merlot and Cabernet Franc. From France and Spain, the grape spread across Europe and to the New World where it found new homes in places like California's Santa Cruz Mountains, Paso Robles, Napa Valley, New Zealand's Hawkes Bay, South Africa's Stellenbosch region, Australia's Margaret River, McLaren Vale and Coonawarra regions, and Chile's Maipo Valley and Colchagua. For most of the 20th century, it was the world's most widely planted premium red wine grape until it was surpassed by Merlot in the 1990s.However, by 2015, Cabernet Sauvignon had once again become the most widely planted wine grape, with a total of 341,000 hectares (3,410 km2) under vine worldwide. Despite its prominence in the industry, the grape is a relatively new variety, the product of a chance crossing between Cabernet Franc and Sauvignon blanc during the 17th century in southwestern France. Its popularity is often attributed to its ease of cultivation—the grapes have thick skins and the vines are hardy and naturally low yielding, budding late to avoid frost and resistant to viticultural hazards such as rot and insects—and to its consistent presentation of structure and flavours which express the typical character (""typicity"") of the variety. Familiarity has helped to sell Cabernet Sauvignon wines to consumers, even when from unfamiliar wine regions. Its widespread popularity has also contributed to criticism of the grape as a ""colonizer"" that takes over wine regions at the expense of indigenous grape varieties. The classic profile of Cabernet Sauvignon tends to be full-bodied wines with high tannins and noticeable acidity that contributes to the wine's aging potential. In cooler climates, Cabernet Sauvignon tends to produce wines with blackcurrant notes that can be accompanied by green bell pepper notes, mint and cedar which will all become more pronounced as the wine ages. In more moderate climates the black currant notes are often seen with black cherry and black olive notes while in very hot climates the currant flavors can veer towards the over-ripe and ""jammy"" side. In parts of Australia, particularly the Coonawarra wine region of South Australia, Cabernet Sauvignon wines tend to have characteristic eucalyptus or menthol notes."
"Olmo grapes are wine and table grape varieties produced by University of California, Davis viticulturist Dr. Harold Olmo. Over the course of his nearly 50-year career, Dr. Olmo bred a wide variety of both grapes by means of both crossing varieties from the same species or creating hybrid grapes from cultivars of different Vitis species. Over 30 new grape varieties were created by Dr. Olmo and introduced to the California wine and table grape industries."
"The Isabella grape is a cultivar derived from the grape species Vitis labrusca or 'fox grape,' which is used for table, juice and wine production."
"Canadice is a cultivar of seedless red grape with a bit of a spicy flavor. It is a late season cultivar ripening about mid-September into October and is hardy up to -20 degrees Fahrenheit. It is used as a table grape and is described as productive with a flavor similar to Delaware grapes. Also, these grapes come in large, cylindrical and somewhat compact clusters and are medium in individual size. Negative attributes of this particular grape are that it is highly susceptible or sensitive to black rot as well as moderately susceptible or sensitive to downy mildew and Botrytis. It is also slightly susceptible or sensitive to powdery mildew. However, tests have shown that Canadice grapes will maintain a high quality for up to four months in storage with high post-harvest sulfur dioxide fumigation. Canadice resulted from a cross of by Himrod and was released by the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, New York, in 1977. Like several other releases from this program, it was named for one of the Finger Lakes, Canadice Lake."
"The Delaware grape is a cultivar derived from the grape species Vitis labrusca or 'Fox grape' which is used for the table and wine production. The skin of the Delaware grape when ripened has a pale red, almost pinkish colour, a tender skin, and juicy sweet flesh. It has small fruit clusters with small berries that do not have the pronounced 'foxiness' of other V. labrusca grapes. It is a slip-skin variety, meaning that the skin is easily separated from the fruit. The grapes are used to make wines including dry, sweet, icewine but is famed for spicy sparkling wines that do not have much of the objectionable foxiness character that other V. labrusca grapes contribute to their wines. The wine is light pink to white in colour. It is a commercially viable grape vine which is grown in the Northeast and Midwest United States, and is vigorous when grafted onto a Phylloxera-resistant root stock. The Delaware grape is susceptible to downy mildew and ripens earlier than 'Concord'. The Delaware grape is also a table grape variety sold in supermarkets throughout South Korea and Japan, where V. labrusca grape varieties are popular for their fragrance. Delaware Punch is named for the Delaware grape from which its flavor is primarily derived."
"Cabernet Franc is one of the major black grape varieties worldwide. It is principally grown for blending with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in the Bordeaux style, but can also be vinified alone, as in the Loire's Chinon. In addition to being used in blends and produced as a varietal in Canada and the United States, it is sometimes made into ice wine in those regions. Cabernet Franc is lighter than Cabernet Sauvignon, making a bright pale red wine that contributes finesse and lends a peppery perfume to blends with more robust grapes. Depending on the growing region and style of wine, additional aromas can include tobacco, raspberry, bell pepper, cassis, and violets. Records of Cabernet Franc in Bordeaux go back to the end of the 18th century, although it was planted in Loire long before that time. DNA analysis indicates that Cabernet Franc is one of two parents of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Carménère."
"Touriga Francesa (or Touriga Franca) is one of the major grape varieties used to produce port wine. Touriga Francesa is lighter and more perfumed than Touriga Nacional, adding finesse to the wine. Touriga Francesa has been described by Jancis Robinson as playing ""Cabernet Franc to Touriga Nacional’s Cabernet Sauvignon"". It is a cross of two other indigenous Portuguese wine grape varieties Mourisco tinto and Touriga Nacional. Touriga Francesa is quite similar to Touriga Nacional, needing harsh conditions to keep down as it gets on the steep arid slopes of the Douro. It is usually trained low to the ground under one of the . Yields are medium (1,5 kg/vine), not as bad as Touriga Nacional."
"Nero d'Avola (Italian pronunciation: [ˈneːro ˈdaːvola]; 'Black of Avola' in Italian) is ""the most important red wine grape in Sicily"" and is one of Italy's most important indigenous varieties. It is named after Avola in the far south of Sicily, and its wines are compared to New World Shirazes, with sweet tannins and plum or peppery flavours. It also contributes to blends."
"Băbească neagră (also Rară Neagră) is a red Moldovan and Romanian wine grape variety. It is cultivated in the south of Moldova and in Romania in the regions of Moldavia, Dobruja and Wallachia, making it the second most widely planted grape variety in Romania. It is also found in Ukraine and New York, United States, where the grape is known as Sereksiya Charni. The name Băbească neagră is derived from the Romanian words meaning ""grandmother's black"". Most wines produced from Băbească Neagră are light-bodied, fruity red wines. Being an old grape variety, Băbească neagră has demonstrated significant clonal variations including Copceac – a variation with bigger berries, Coada Rândunicii (Swallowtail) - a variation with a bisected bunch and Coada Vulpii (Foxtail) — a variation that has a cylindrical prolongation of the bunch. It has also produced over the years two color mutations including a pink-berried mutation which is called Băbească gri in Romania and Sereksiya rose in Finger Lakes, and a white-berried mutation known as Băbească albă."
"Pinot Meunier, pronounced [pi.no mø.nje], also known as Meunier or Schwarzriesling, is a variety of red wine grape most noted for being one of the three main varieties used in the production of Champagne (the other two are the red variety Pinot noir and the white Chardonnay). Until recently, producers in Champagne generally did not acknowledge Pinot Meunier, preferring to emphasise the use of the other noble varieties, but now Pinot Meunier is gaining recognition for the body and richness it contributes to Champagne. Pinot Meunier is approximately one-third of all the grapes planted in Champagne. It is a chimeric mutation of Pinot: its inner cell layers are composed of a Pinot genotype which is close to Pinot noir or Pinot gris; the outer, epidermal, layer is however made up of a mutant, distinctive, genotype. Pinot Meunier was first mentioned in the 16th century, and gets its name and synonyms (French Meunier and German Müller—both meaning miller) from flour-like dusty white down on the underside of its leaves."
"Cinsaut or Cinsault (/ˈsænsoʊ/ SAN-soh) is a red wine grape, whose heat tolerance and productivity make it important in Languedoc-Roussillon and the former French colonies of Algeria, Lebanon and Morocco. It is often blended with grapes such as Grenache and Carignan to add softness and bouquet. It has many synonyms, of which perhaps the most confusing is its sale as a table grape called 'Oeillade', although it is different from the ""true"" Oeillade which is no longer cultivated. In South Africa, it was known as ""Hermitage"", hence the name of its most famous cross Pinotage."
"The Zweigelt is a new Austrian grape created in 1922 by Friedrich Zweigelt (1888–1964), who later became Director of the Federal Institute and Experimental Station of Viticulture, Fruit Production and Horticulture (1938–1945). It comprises a crossing between St. Laurent and Blaufränkisch."
"Blauer Portugieser is a red Austrian, Slovenian wine and German wine grape found primarily in the Rheinhessen, Pfalz and wine regions of Lower Austria and Slovenia. It is also one of the permitted grapes in the Hungarian wine Egri Bikavér (Bull's blood). In Germany, the cultivated area covered 4,551 hectares (11,250 acres) or 4.5% of the total vineyard area in 2007. Wine cellars usually vinify a simple light red wine, which is characterized by a fresh, tart and light body. It is also frequently vinified as a rosé. Blauer Portugieser is also very well suited as table grapes; however, it is not sold as such because the selling of wine grapes as table grapes is not permitted in the European Union. Since 2000, higher quality wines have been vinified from Portugieser grapes. The use of oak provides additional aromas in order to compete with Bordeaux varieties. DNA profiling has shown that Blauer Portugieser is a cross between Grüner Silvaner (male parent) and (female parent; the offspring of ). Historical ampelographic sources have provided very solid evidence that the geographic area of origin of the variety is Lower Styria (today Slovenian Styria)."
"Malbec (pronounced [mal.bɛk]) is a purple grape variety used in making red wine. The grapes tend to have an inky dark color and robust tannins, and are known as one of the six grapes allowed in the blend of red Bordeaux wine. In France, plantations of Malbec are now found primarily in Cahors in South West France, though the grape is grown worldwide. It is increasingly celebrated as an Argentine varietal. The grape became less popular in Bordeaux after 1956 when frost killed off 75% of the crop. Despite Cahors being hit by the same frost, which devastated the vineyards, Malbec was replanted and continued to be popular in that area. Winemakers in the region frequently mixed Malbec with Merlot and Tannat to make dark, full-bodied wines, but have ventured into 100% Malbec varietal wines more recently. A popular but unconfirmed theory claims that Malbec is named after a Hungarian peasant who first spread the grape variety throughout France. French ampelographer and viticulturalist Pierre Galet notes, however, that most evidence suggests that Côt was the variety's original name and that it probably originated in northern Burgundy. Due to similarities in synonyms, Malbec is often confused with other varieties of grape. Malbec argenté is not Malbec, but rather a variety of the southwestern French grape Abouriou. In Cahors, the Malbec grape is referred to as Auxerrois or Côt Noir; this is sometimes confused with Auxerrois blanc, which is an entirely different variety. The Malbec grape is a thick-skinned grape and needs more sun and heat than either Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot to mature. It ripens mid-season and can bring very deep color, ample tannin, and a particular plum-like flavor component which adds complexity to claret blends. Sometimes, especially in its traditional growing regions, it is not trellised but is instead cultivated as bush vines (the goblet system). In such cases, it is sometimes kept to a relatively low yield of about 6 tons per hectare. Wines produced using this growing method are rich, dark, and juicy. As a varietal, Malbec creates a rather inky red (or violet), intense wine, so it is also commonly used in blends, such as with Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon to create the red French Bordeaux claret blend. The grape is blended with Cabernet Franc and Gamay in some regions such as the Loire Valley. Other wine regions use the grape to produce Bordeaux-style blends. The varietal is sensitive to frost and has a propensity for shattering or coulure."
"Pinotage /ˈpɪnətɑːʒ/ PIN-ə-tahzh is a red wine grape that is South Africa's signature variety. It was cultivated there in 1925 as a cross between Pinot noir and Cinsaut (Cinsaut was known as ""Hermitage"" in South Africa at that time, hence the name). It typically produces deep red varietal wines with smoky, bramble and earthy flavours, sometimes with notes of bananas and tropical fruit, but has been criticised for sometimes smelling of acetone. The grape is a viticultural intraspecific cross of two varieties of Vitis vinifera, not an interspecific hybrid."
"Durif is a variety of red wine grape primarily grown in Australia, California, France, and Israel. Since the end of the 20th century, wineries located in Washington's Yakima River Valley, Maryland, Arizona, Texas, West Virginia, Chile, Mexico's Baja California Peninsula, and Ontario's Niagara Peninsula have also produced wines from Durif grapes. It is the main grape known in the U.S. and Israel as Petite Sirah, with over 90% of the California plantings labeled ""Petite Sirah"" being Durif grapes; the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) recognizes ""Durif"" and ""Petite Sirah"" as synonyms for the same grape. It produces tannic wines with a spicy, plummy flavour. The grape originated as a cross of Syrah pollen germinating a Peloursin plant. On some occasions, Peloursin and Syrah vines may be called Petite Sirah, usually because the varieties are extremely difficult to distinguish in old age."
"Barbera is a red Italian wine grape variety that, as of 2000, was the third most-planted red grape variety in Italy (after Sangiovese and Montepulciano). It produces good yields and is known for deep color, full body, low tannins and high levels of acidity. Century-old vines still exist in many regional vineyards and allow for the production of long-aging, robust red wines with intense fruit and enhanced tannic content. The best known appellation is the DOCG (Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita) Barbera d'Asti in the Piedmont region: the highest-quality Nizza DOCG wines are produced within a sub-zone of the Barbera d'Asti production area. When young, the wines offer a very intense aroma of fresh red cherries and blackberries. In the lightest versions notes of cherries, raspberries and blueberries and with notes of blackberry and black cherries in wines made of more ripe grapes. Many producers employ the use of toasted oak barrels, which provides for increased complexity, aging potential, and hints of vanilla notes. The lightest versions are generally known for flavors and aromas of fresh fruit and dried fruits, and are not recommended for cellaring. Wines with better balance between acid and fruit, often with the addition of oak and having a high alcohol content are more capable of cellaring; these wines often result from reduced-yield viticultural methods."
"Bonarda Piemontese, now officially listed simply as Bonarda but also known as Bonarda di Chieri and Bonarda del Monferrato is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the northwestern region of Piedmont. Prior to the phylloxera epidemic of the 19th century, Bonarda was speculated to have accounted for 30% of the plantings in Piedmont but today is only found in scattered plantings along the left bank of the Tanaro river near Govone. In the mid-1990s, the grape experienced a slight revival as Piedmontese producers sought to add more aromatics to their Barbera wines by blending in Bonarda. Despite the similarities of their synonyms, the grape is not related to Douce noir grape which is known as Bonarda in Argentina nor the Croatina grape, which make tannic wines similar to Piedmont's Dolcetto."
"Graciano is a Spanish red wine grape that is grown primarily in Rioja. The vine produces a low yield that are normally harvested in late October. The wine produced is characterized by its deep red color, strong aroma and ability to age well. Graciano thrives in warm, arid climates."
"Petit Verdot is a variety of red wine grape, principally used in classic Bordeaux blends. It ripens much later than the other varieties in Bordeaux, often too late, so it fell out of favour in its home region. When it does ripen it adds tannin, colour and flavour, in small amounts, to the blend. Petit verdot has attracted attention among winemakers in the New World, where it ripens more reliably and has been made into single varietal wine. It is also useful in 'stiffening' the mid palate of Cabernet Sauvignon blends. When young its aromas have been likened to banana and pencil shavings. Strong tones of violet and leather develop as it matures."
"Duras is a traditional French variety of red wine grape that is mostly grown around the river Tarn, northeast of Toulouse. It is usually blended with other traditional varieties, but production has been declining in recent years. Despite the name the grape appears to have no connection with the Côtes de Duras east of Bordeaux, and is not grown there today. Nor is there any known link with the of Piedmont."
"Alicante Bouschet or Alicante Henri Bouschet is a wine grape variety that has been widely cultivated since 1866. It is a cross of Petit Bouschet (itself a cross of the very old variety and Aramon) and Grenache. Alicante is a teinturier, a grape with red flesh. It is one of the few teinturier grapes that belong to the Vitis vinifera species. Its deep colour makes it useful for blending with light red wine. It was planted heavily during Prohibition in California for export to the East Coast. Its thick skin made it resistant to rot during the transportation process. The intense red color was also helpful for stretching the wine during prohibition, as it could be diluted without detracting from the appearance. At the turn of the 21st century, Alicante Bouschet was the 12th most planted red wine grape in France with sizable plantings in the Languedoc, Provence and Cognac regions. In 1958, Alicante Bouschet covered 24,168 hectares (mainly across southern France); by 2011, plantings represented less than 4,000 hectares. This scenario is largely reversed in other regions of Europe, and in southern Portugal, where its wines are highly prized and frequently outscore traditional autochthonous varieties."
"Abouriou (French spelling of Occitan aboriu, early) is a red French wine grape variety grown primarily in Southwest France and, in small quantities, California. It is a blending grape that, along with Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Fer, Cabernet Franc, and Merlot, is used to make the Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) wine of Côtes du Marmandais. Abouriou can also be made into a varietal, as it is used in some vin de pays wines. The grape is known for its low acidity and high tannin content. Though Abouriou shares several synonyms (alternative names other than the full botanical name) with the Beaujolais grape Gamay, their morphology differs and DNA evidence has shown the two varieties to be distinct. In California, the grape is sometimes called Early Burgundy, another allusion to Gamay. With a tendency to bud and ripen early, the vine produces high yields and vigorous growth with a relatively high resistance to most grape diseases."
Aleatico is a red Italian wine grape variety. It is notable for being the primary grape in the cult wine Aleatico di Portoferraio made in Elba. In Chile is known as Red Moscatel. The grape has also been cultivated at Mudgee in New South Wales and California.
"Cadarca or Kadarka or Gamza is a dark-skinned variety of grape used for red wine. It has a long history and is popular in Romania and Bulgaria, where it is known as Гъмза Gamza. It used to be an important constituent of the Hungarian red cuvée Bull's Blood of Eger or Szekszárd, but has long been in decline in Hungarian plantations, to be replaced by Kékfrankos and Portugieser. It is also grown in most other central European and balkan countries where it is sometimes known as Cadarca or Skadarska. Kadarka is sometimes assumed to originate from Hungary. Another hypothesis is that is related to the variety , which is supposed to originate from Lake Scutari, which is situated on the border between Albania and Montenegro. In a recent study, it is claimed that one of the parents of Kadarka is Papazkarası which is grown in Strandja region of Kırklareli. Cadarca (Kadarka) wine is characterised by full, easily recognizable taste, deep aroma and dark or medium dark colour. Kadarka is often used for cuvees including some of the Egri Bikavérs, and also for production of table wines. The best Kadarka is grown in Minis, Romania from 17th century. In Bulgaria, Gamza is mostly cultivated in the northwestern and central northern regions, in the Danubian Plain. Until the recent decades, Gamza was the dominant grape varietal in these Bulgarian regions. The main features of Gamza are a large yet compact cluster of small, almost spherical grapes, dark blue to black in colour."
"Negroamaro (seldom Negro amaro; meaning ""black [and] bitter"") is a red wine grape variety native to southern Italy. It is grown almost exclusively in Apulia and particularly in Salento, the peninsula which can be visualised as the ""heel"" of Italy. The grape can produce wines very deep in color. Wines made from Negroamaro tend to be very rustic in character, combining perfume with an earthy bitterness. The grape produces some of the best red wines of Apulia, particularly when blended with the highly scented Malvasia Nera, as in the case of Salice Salentino."
"Ciliegiolo is a variety of red wine grape from Italy, named after the Italian for 'cherry'. It is a minor component of traditional blends such as Chianti, but interest has revived in recent years. In Umbria it is made into a light wine, while in Tuscany it is made into a bigger, more structured style."
"Dornfelder is a dark-skinned variety of grape of German origin used for red wine. It was created by August Herold (1902–1973) at the grape breeding institute in Weinsberg in the Württemberg region in 1955. Herold crossed the grape varieties Helfensteiner and Heroldrebe, the latter which bears his name, to create Dornfelder. Helfensteiner (Frühburgunder/Pinot Noir Précoce × Trollinger/Schiava Grossa) and Heroldrebe (Blauer Portugieser × Blaufränkisch/Lemberger) were both crosses created some decades earlier by Herold. Dornfelder received varietal protection and was released for cultivation in 1979. It was named in honor of (1796–1869), a senior civil servant who was instrumental in creating the viticultural school in Weinsberg. Traditionally, the red wines of Germany were mostly pale and light-bodied, but new breeds of dark-skinned grapes led by Dornfelder have allowed the production of more internationally styled reds. Dornfelderhas a depth of color, good acidity and the ability to benefit from barrique aging and the associated oak flavours. In comparison to traditional red wine varieties of Germany, Dornfelder is easier to grow than Spätburgunder, has better resistance to rot than Blauer Portugieser (as well as deeper color, more powerful flavours and more tannin), has stronger stalks than Trollinger, ripens earlier than Lemberger, and achieves higher must weights, i.e., higher natural alcohol levels than most of these varieties. Dornfelder can be very productive, and yield up to 120 hectoliter per hectare, but quality-conscious producers typically keep yields much lower. Higher-quality Dornfelder wines are velvety textured, slightly floral, often show flavours of plums, blackberries or cherries, and are typically oaked. Sometimes the wines have a hint of sweetness. Dornfelder is the second most grown red wine grape variety in Germany. Steadily increased plantings throughout the 1980s and 1990s allowed it to overtake Blauer Portugieser in 2001. It has established itself in most German regions, and been particularly successful in Rheinhessen and the Palatinate. In 2006, Dornfelder was grown on 8,231 hectares (20,340 acres) in Germany, and no longer has an increasing trend."
"Dunkelfelder is a dark-skinned variety of grape used for red wine. It was created by Germanviticulturalist Gustav Adolf Froelich (1847-1912). He probably crossed (a teinturier) with Blauer Portugieser. The variety, initially called Froelich V 4-4, did not receive any attention for several decades until work was continued on it at Geisenheim grape breeding institute in the 1930s. It was named Dunkelfelder (dunkel = dark) by ampelographer Helmut Becker, due to its unclear parentage and its dark colour. Dunkelfelder received varietal protection and was released for general cultivation in 1980. In 2006, there were 372 hectares (920 acres) of Dunkelfelder in Germany, with an approximately constant trend. Plantings of Dunkelfelder are primarily found in Ahr, Baden, Nahe, Palatinate and Rheinhessen. Dunkelfelder wines are deep and dark red in colour, which used to be difficult to achieve with German red wines, and it has therefore often been used for blends, although varietal Dunkelfelder wines are also produced. It is known under the synonyms Farbtraube Froelich, Froelich V 4-4 and Purpur."
"Acolon is a German wine grape variety, a cross between Blauer Lemberger (Blaufränkisch) and Dornfelder. It was created in 1971 at the Staatliche Lehr- und Versuchsanstalt für Wein- und Obstbau in Weinsberg (nr. Württemberg), Germany. The variety was officially recognised in 2002. It ripens early and produces a very color-intensive wine with mild tannins, resembling Lemberger. Currently it is growing experimentally on 1.35 square kilometres. Since 1981 it has often been used as a partner in creating new genetically diverse varieties."
Groppello is a red Italian wine grape variety planted primarily in the Lombardy region.
"Blauburger is a red wine grape variety that is grown a little in Austria, Czech Republic and Hungary. It should not be confused with Blauburgunder, which is an Austrian synonym for Pinot noir."
"Cabernet Dorsa is a dark-skinned variety of grape used for red wine. It was created at a grape breeding institute in Weinsberg in the Württemberg wine region of Germany in 1971 by crossing Dornfelder and Cabernet Sauvignon. Cabernet Dorsa received varietal protection and was released for general cultivation in 2003. The vines of Cabernet Dorsa show good winter hardiness and the grapes reach higher must weights than Dornfelder or Spätburgunder under typical German growing conditions. In 2006, there were 214 hectares (530 acres) of Cabernet Dorsa in Germany, with an increasing trend. In 2000, before the variety's general release, there existed only 2.87 hectares (7.1 acres) of experimental plantations. Cabernet Dorsa wines are deep in colour, rich in tannin, have noticeable aromas of cherry and bell peppers and are considered well suited for oak barrel aging. It is known under the synonyms (breeding codes) We 71-817-92 with We denoting Weinsberg."
"Dameron is a traditional French variety of red wine grape that is a sibling of Gamay. Its wines are somewhat weightier than Gamay, but it is disappearing from its traditional areas in northern France. Not much is grown in France these days."
"Muscardin is a dark-skinned grape variety primarily found in the southern part of the Rhône region. It is primarily noted for being one of the thirteen grape varieties permitted in the Châteauneuf-du-Pape appellation. It is a very rare variety, and in 2004 only 0.4% of the appellation's vineyards were planted with Muscardin. The resulting red wines tends to have high acid levels, low alcohol, light tannic structure but can show attractive flowery aromas. The color is also lighter than most Rhone varieties and the wine is prone to the wine fault of oxidation."
"Espadeiro is a red Portuguese wine grape planted primarily in the Minho region for making Vinho Verde. It is also grown across the border, in Galicia (Spain) where it is used to make light bodied wines. Rather than being a single grape variety, there are several variants in the Espadeiro family of grapes, including Espadeiro tinto and Espadeiro Mole, with partially overlapping synonyms."
"Tinta Negra Mole is a red Portuguese wine grape commonly used in the production of Madeira. It is the most widely planted variety on the Madeira islands and is considered the industry's ""workhorse grape"". The grape produces very high yields of sweet, pale red wine."
"Refosco dal Peduncolo Rosso is a red Italian wine grape grown predominantly in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region of northeast Italy. The grape is a variety in the Refosco family (which also includes e.g. Terrano) and derives its name from its red stems. It is found in the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) of Colli Orientali del Friuli, , and . It is also found in the Veneto portion of the and in the Slovenian wine region of Koper. In Slovenia, Refosco dal Peduncolo Rosso and Refosco are both called Terrano and are commonly used in a field blend."
"Sciacarello (or Sciaccarello, Sciaccarellu) is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown primarily in Corsica. It is most noted for the wines that come from Ajaccio which tend to be highly perfumed. It is also associated with wines from Calvi, and in the Sartène region around Propriano. The grape is normally blended and rarely made into a varietal wine. Sciacarello is believed to be a parent vine of the Ligurian-Tuscan wine grape, pollera nera. Di Vecchi Staraz, Bandinelli, Boselli, This, Boursiquot, Laucou, Lacombe, and Varès (2007) showed that Sciaccarello (or Sciaccarellu as it is known in Corsica) and another Corsican variety Malvasia Montanaccio as well as Tuscan varieties Biancone, Caloria, Colombana Nera, and Pollera Nera have genetic ties to Mammolo. It makes a highly drinkable, soft and spicy red and rosé wine."
"Montepulciano (UK: /ˌmɒnteɪpʊlˈtʃɑːnoʊ, -tɪp-/ MON-tay-puul-CHAH-noh, -⁠tih-, Italian: [ˌmontepulˈtʃaːno]) is a red Italian wine grape variety that is most noted for being the primary grape behind the DOCG wines , Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, Montepulciano d'Abruzzo Colline Teramane, and the DOC wine . It should not be confused with the similarly named Tuscan wine Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, which is made from predominantly Sangiovese and is named for the town it is produced in, rather than for containing any Montepulciano grapes in the blend. The grape is widely planted throughout central and southern Italy, most notably in Abruzzo, Lazio, Marche, Molise, Umbria and Apulia, and is a permitted variety in DOC wines produced in 20 of Italy's 95 provinces. Montepulciano is rarely found in northern Italy because the grape has a tendency to ripen late and can be excessively ""green"" if harvested too early. When fully ripened, Montepulciano can produce deeply colored wines, with moderate acidity and noticeable and alcohol levels."
"Schioppettino (pronounced [skjoppetˈtiːno]; meaning ""gunshot"" or ""little crack"" also known as ""Ribolla Nera"") is a red Italian wine grape grown predominantly in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region of northeast Italy. The grape is believed to have originated between the comune of Prepotto and the Slovenian border where records of the Schiopettino wine being used in marriage ceremonies date to 1282. The grape was nearly lost to extinction following the phylloxera epidemic of the late 19th century when vineyard owners decided against replanting the variety in favor of French wine grapes like Cabernet franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot gris, Sauvignon blanc and Merlot. Some isolated plantings continued to exist until a 1978 European Union decree encouraged its planting in the province of Udine."
"Merlot is a dark blue–colored wine grape variety, that is used as both a blending grape and for varietal wines. The name Merlot is thought to be a diminutive of merle, the French name for the blackbird, probably a reference to the color of the grape. Its softness and ""fleshiness"", combined with its earlier ripening, makes Merlot a popular grape for blending with the sterner, later-ripening Cabernet Sauvignon, which tends to be higher in tannin. Along with Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot, Merlot is one of the primary grapes used in Bordeaux wine, and it is the most widely planted grape in the Bordeaux wine regions. Merlot is also one of the most popular red wine varietals in many markets. This flexibility has helped to make it one of the world's most planted grape varieties. As of 2004, Merlot was estimated to be the third most grown variety at 260,000 hectares (640,000 acres) globally.The area planted to Merlot has continued to increase, with 266,000 hectares (660,000 acres) in 2015. While Merlot is made across the globe, there tend to be two main styles. The ""International style"" favored by many New World wine regions tends to emphasize late harvesting to gain physiological ripeness and produce inky, purple colored wines that are full in body with high alcohol and lush, velvety tannins with intense, plum and blackberry fruit. While this international style is practiced by many Bordeaux wine producers, the traditional ""Bordeaux style"" of Merlot involves harvesting Merlot earlier to maintain acidity and producing more medium-bodied wines with moderate alcohol levels that have fresh, red fruit flavors (raspberries, strawberries) and potentially leafy, vegetal notes."
"Sagrantino is an Italian grape variety that is indigenous to the region of Umbria in Central Italy. It is grown primarily in the village of Montefalco and the surrounding area, with a recent rapid increase in planting area from 351 hectares (870 acres) in 2000 to 994 hectares (2,460 acres) by 2010 dedicated to the grape, in the hands of about 50 producers."
"Nebbiolo (/ˌnɛbiˈoʊloʊ/, Italian: [nebˈbjɔːlo]; Piedmontese: nebieul [neˈbjøl]) is an Italian red wine grape variety predominantly associated with its native Piedmont region, where it makes the Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) wines of Barolo, Barbaresco, Roero, Gattinara, Carema and Ghemme. Nebbiolo is thought to derive its name from the Italian nebbia or Piedmontese nebia, meaning ""fog"". During harvest, which generally takes place late in October, a deep, intense fog sets into the Langhe region where many Nebbiolo vineyards are located. Alternative explanations refers to the fog-like glaucous veil that forms over the berries as they reach maturity, or that perhaps the name is derived instead from the Italian word nobile, meaning noble. Nebbiolo produces lightly-colored red wines which can be highly tannic in youth with scents of tar and roses. As they age, the wines take on a characteristic brick-orange hue at the rim of the glass and mature to reveal other aromas and flavors such as violets, tar, wild herbs, cherries, raspberries, truffles, tobacco, and prunes. Nebbiolo wines can require years of aging to balance the tannins with other characteristics."
"Pelaverga is a red wine grape variety native to Piedmont. It is described as rare and pale, and lends itself to making lightly sparkling, strawberry-flavoured wines. It may also be used as a table grape."
"Rondinella is an Italian wine grape variety. Almost all of the total global growing area of 2,481 hectares (6,130 acres) is in the Veneto region of northern Italy, and the grapes are used in wines from the Valpolicella and Bardolino wine regions. Rondinella always appears in these wines blended with Corvina (which DNA evidence has shown to be a parent variety), as a secondary constituent along with Corvinone and Molinara. The grape has rather neutral flavors but is favored by growers due to its prolific yields. The vine is very resistant to grape disease and produces grapes that, while they do not necessarily have high sugar levels, do dry out well for use in the production of Valpolicella straw wine styles such as Recioto and Amarone."
"Molinara is a red Italian wine grape which accounted for 595 hectares (1,470 acres) of planting land in Italy as of 2010, almost exclusively in the Veneto region. It adds acidity to the wines of the Valpolicella and Bardolino regions, which are made with blends of Corvina, Corvinone, Molinara and Rondinella. The wine's high propensity for oxidation, coupled with its low color extract, has caused a decline in favor and plantings among Venetian vineyards, declining in ten years by more than half from an area of 1,301 hectares (3,210 acres) in 2000. There has been debate about whether the grape is purple or blue. This grape is occasionally blended with Merlot to produce soft elegant rosés, and Molinara also accounts for 122 hectares (300 acres) of planting land in Spain."
"Corvina is an Italian wine grape variety that is sometimes also referred to as Corvina Veronese or Cruina. The total global wine-growing area in 2010 was 7,495 hectares (18,520 acres), all of which is grown in the Veneto region of northeast Italy, except for 19 hectares (47 acres) planted in Argentina. Corvina is used with several other grapes to create the light red regional wines Bardolino and Valpolicella that have a mild fruity flavor with hints of almond. These blends include Corvinone, Rondinella, and Molinara, and Rossignola for the latter wine. It is also used for the production of Amarone and Recioto."
"Fetească Neagră (Romanian pronunciation: [feˈte̯askə ˈne̯aɡrə]); English: Black Maiden) is an old pre-phylloxeric variety of Romanian - Moldovan grape, cultivated mainly in several areas in the Romanian regions of Moldavia, Muntenia, Oltenia, Banat, Northern Dobruja and also in the Republic of Moldova. These grapes produce dry, demi-dry or sweet wines, with an alcohol content of 12-14%, a deep red colour with ruby shades, and a black currant flavour, which becomes richer and smoother with aging."
"Busuioacă de Bohotin (Romanian pronunciation: [busuˈjo̯akə de bohoˈtin]) is a grape which originates from the Bohotin region, in Southeast Iași County, Romania, and is also cultivated in other small areas: Huși in Vaslui County, Pietroasele in Buzău County and Tohani in Prahova County, on a total area of no more than 100 ha. The wine has a light red color. Its flavor resembles honeysuckle and ripe juicy peaches. The sweet taste sometimes has a barely perceptible almond like bitter aroma caused by the latent cyanide moiety."
"Mourvèdre (also known as Mataro or Monastrell) is a red wine grape variety grown in many regions around the world including the Rhône and Provence regions of France, the Valencia and Jumilla and Yecla denominaciones de origen (DOs) of Spain, as well as the Balearic Islands, California and Washington and the Australian regions of South Australia and New South Wales, as well as South Africa. In addition to making red varietal wines, Mourvèdre is a prominent component in ""GSM"" (Grenache, Syrah, and Mourvèdre) blends. The variety is also used to make rosé and port-style fortified wines. Mourvèdre tends to produce tannic wines that can be high in alcohol. The style of wine produced from the grapes varies greatly according to where it is produced, but according to wine expert Jancis Robinson Mourvèdre wines often have wild game, or earthy notes to them, with soft red fruit flavors. According to wine expert Oz Clarke, young Mourvèdre can come across as faulted due to the reductive, sulfur notes and ""farmyard-y"" flavors that some wines can exhibit before those flavors mellow with age. The variety can be a difficult grape to grow, preferring ""its face in the hot sun and its feet in the water"" meaning that it needs very warm weather, a low leaf-to-fruit ratio but adequate water or irrigation to produce intensely flavored fruit that is not overly jammy or herbaceous. The vines' susceptibility to many viticultural hazards such as powdery and downy mildew as well as overly vigorous foliage can present additional problems for vine growers."
"Tempranillo (also known as Ull de Llebre, Cencibel, Tinto Fino and Tinta del Pais in Spain, Aragonez or Tinta Roriz in Portugal, and several other synonyms elsewhere) is a black grape variety widely grown to make full-bodied red wines in its native Spain. Its name is the diminutive of the Spanish temprano (""early""), a reference to the fact that it ripens several weeks earlier than most Spanish red grapes. Tempranillo has been grown on the Iberian Peninsula since the time of Phoenician settlements. It is the main grape used in Rioja, and is often referred to as Spain's noble grape. The grape has been planted throughout the globe's wine regions. In 2015, Tempranillo was the fourth most widely planted wine grape variety worldwide with 232,561 hectares (574,670 acres) under vine, of which 87% was in Spain where it is the most planted red grape variety. Unlike more aromatic red wine varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese and Pinot noir, Tempranillo has a relatively neutral profile so it is often blended with other varieties, such as Grenache and Carignan (known in Rioja as Mazuelo), or aged for extended periods in oak where the wine easily takes on the flavor of the barrel. Varietal examples of Tempranillo usually exhibit flavors of plum and strawberries. Tempranillo is an early ripening variety that tends to thrive in chalky vineyard soils such as those of the Ribera del Duero region of Spain. In Portugal, where the grape is known as Tinto Roriz and Aragonez, it is blended with others to produce port wine."
"Bobal is a variety of Vitis vinifera, a red grape used in winemaking. It is native to the Utiel-Requena region in Valencia, Spain. The presence of Bobal in Utiel-Requena was documented in the 15th century in ""Espill o llibre de les dones” by Jaume Roig. The name derives from the Latin bovale, in reference to the shape of a bull’s head. It is grown predominantly in the Utiel-Requena DOP where it represents about 80% of the red grapes vines grown, and is also present in significant quantities in Valencia, Cuenca and Albacete. It can only be found in small quantities in other regions of Spain: La Manchuela (Castilla–La Mancha), selected vineyards in Ribera del Guadiana, Alicante, Murcia, Campo de Borja, Calatayud, Cariñena, Valdejalón. In 2015 there were 61,524 hectares (152,029 acres) in Spain, making Bobal the second most common red grape variety in Spain. Small quantities are also grown in Rosellón (south of France) and in Sardinia (Italy). The best wines are deep, soft color. Bobal has traditionally been used for the production of bulk wine, but producers working in higher altitudes than 800 metres (2,625 feet) above sea level, as Bodega De Moya are taking this variety more seriously."
"Moristel is a minor Spanish red grape variety. It is mainly found in the autonomous region of Aragon and is one of the authorized varieties of the Somontano Denominación de Origen (DO). It has medium-sized, compact bunches with medium-sized, cylindrical-shaped berries with a blue hue. Traditionally it has been used for blending with other varieties to add body and colour to the wine."
"Blaufränkisch (German for blue Frankish) is a dark-skinned variety of grape used for red wine. Blaufränkisch, which is a late-ripening variety, produces red wines which are typically rich in tannin and may exhibit a pronounced spicy character. The grape is grown across Central Europe, including Austria, Czech Republic (in particular southern Moravia where it is known as Frankovka), Germany, Slovakia (where it is known as Frankovka modrá), Croatia, Serbia (frankovka), Slovenia (known as modra frankinja), and Italy (Franconia). In Hungary the grape is called Kékfrankos (also lit. blue Frankish) and is grown in a number of wine regions including Sopron, Villány, Szekszárd, and Eger (where it is a major ingredient in the famous red wine blend known as Egri Bikavér (lit. Bull's Blood) having largely replaced the Kadarka grape). It has been called ""the Pinot noir of the East"" because of its spread and reputation in Eastern Europe. In America the grape is also known as Lemberger, Blauer Limberger or Blue Limberger and grown in Pennsylvania, Washington state, Michigan, New Jersey, Idaho, New York, Colorado, Ohio, Virginia. and California, DNA profiling has shown that Blaufränkisch is a cross between Gouais blanc (Weißer Heunisch; male parent) and (female parent; the offspring of ). Historical sources of grapevine classification have provided very solid evidence that the geographic area of origin of the variety is Lower Styria (today Slovenian Styria). For a long time before the application of DNA analysis, Blaufränkisch was erroneously thought to be a clone of the Gamay grape variety, due to certain similarities in morphology and possibly due to its name Gamé in Bulgaria. The German name Lemberger derives from the fact that it was imported to Germany in the 19th century from Lemberg in Lower Styria in present-day Slovenia and then in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. An 1877 export of Lembergerreben to Germany has been recorded. The almost identical name Limberger refers to Limburg at Maissau in Lower Austria, where in the late 19th century ""ungrafted Limberg Blaufränkisch vines"" (wurzelechte Limberger Blaufränkisch-Reben) were offered for sale."
"The Carménère grape is a wine grape variety originally planted in the Médoc region of Bordeaux, France, where it was used to produce deep red wines and occasionally used for blending purposes in the same manner as Petit Verdot. A member of the Cabernet family of grapes, the name ""Carménère"" originates from the French word for crimson (carmin) which refers to the brilliant crimson colour of the autumn foliage prior to leaf-fall. The grape is also known as Grande Vidure, a historic Bordeaux synonym, although current European Union regulations prohibit imports under this name into the European Union. Along with Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot, Carménère is considered part of the original six red grapes of Bordeaux. Now rarely found in France, the world's largest area planted with this variety is in Chile, with more than 8,800 hectares (2009) cultivated in the Central Valley. As such, Chile produces the vast majority of Carménère wines available today and as the Chilean wine industry grows, more experimentation is being carried out on Carménère's potential as a blending grape, especially with Cabernet Sauvignon. Carménère is also grown in Italy's Eastern Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia regions, in Argentina, and in smaller quantities in California, Walla Walla (Washington and Oregon), and Rockingham County, North Carolina in the United States."
"Tannat is a red wine grape, historically grown in South West France in the Madiran AOC, and is now one of the most prominent grapes in Uruguay, where it is considered the ""national grape"". Tannat is also grown in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, South Africa, and in the Italian region of Apulia, where it is used as a blending grape. In the states of Maryland and Virginia, there are small experimental plantings of the vine, and plantings in California have increased dramatically in the first years of the 21st century. It has also been increasingly planted in Arizona, Oregon and Texas. Tannat wines produced in Uruguay are usually quite different in character from Madiran wines, being lighter in body and lower in tannins. It is also used to make full bodied rosé. In France, efforts to solve the harsh tannic nature of the grape led to the development of the winemaking technique known as micro-oxygenation."
"Saperavi (Georgian: საფერავი; literally ""paint, dye, give color"") is an acidic, teinturier-type grape variety native to the country of Georgia, where it is used to make many of the region's most well-known wines. It is also grown in Russia, in lesser quantities in Armenia, Moldova, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Australia. Some small plantations are found in the Niagara and Finger Lakes regions of New York State and Northeast Ohio. Its leaves are 3-lobed, large, and roundish. The berries are medium to large, elliptic or round depending on the type, dark bluish, and thin-skinned; with a maturation period of approximately 5 months and moderate productivity. It is an extractive wine with a characteristic bouquet, a harmonious taste, and pleasant astringency. Its alcoholic strength ranges from 10.5-12.5% and titrated acidity 5-7%. Saperavi grapes produce very deep red wines that are suitable for extended aging. It has the potential to produce high alcohol levels, and is often blended with lighter varieties. It is by far the most dominant Georgian red grape in terms of overall production. Saperavi is a hardy variety, known for its ability to handle extremely cold weather and is popular for growing in high altitude and inland regions such as Kakheti. It is a teinturier grape, containing the red anthocyanin within the grape pulp as well as the skin and is unusual in being one of very few such grapes used in single-varietal winemaking."
"Argaman (Hebrew: ארגמן (ענבים)‎) is an Israeli wine grape. It is a crossing of Souzão and Carignan. The intention was to produce a variety of wine grape with good rich color, which had been a problem in Israeli wine. Roi Spiegel of the Volcani Institute of Agricultural Research and Shlomo Cohen of the Israeli Wine Institute created the Argaman (lit. ""crimson"") with this purpose in mind. After hundreds of attempts and micro-vinifications, successful wines were produced from it. Barkan Wine Cellars is one of the wineries that uses the variety. According to The Oxford Companion to Wine, the Argaman is used primarily for low quality jug wines. However, Segal Wines, produced from Argaman grapes grown in a vineyard in the Upper Galilee, has won prestigious awards, among them a gold medal at the Bordeaux wine competition. In addition, Jezreel Valley winery won a silver medal at Terravino 2012 with a red blend which includes Argaman. A red wine blend that contains Argaman, the Jezreel 2014 Adumim, has earned 93 out of 100 points by the Wine Enthusiast. Jezreel Valley Winery is one of the leading revolutionaries in the resurgence of Argaman and has successfully bottled a single varietal Argaman which is rich, spicy and complex."
"Touriga Nacional is a variety of red wine grape, considered by many to be Portugal's finest. Despite the low yields from its small grapes, it plays a big part in the blends used for ports, and is increasingly being used for table wine in the Douro and Dão. Touriga Nacional provides structure and body to wine, with high tannins and concentrated flavors of black fruit. Jancis Robinson has compared its relationship with Touriga Francesa to the partnership between Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, the former providing structure, the latter filling out the bouquet."
"César is an ancient red wine grape from northern Burgundy. It makes dark, tannic wines that are softened by blending with Pinot noir."
"Pinot noir (French: [pino nwaʁ]) is a red wine grape variety of the species Vitis vinifera. The name may also refer to wines created predominantly from Pinot noir grapes. The name is derived from the French words for pine and black. The word pine alludes to the grape variety having tightly clustered, pine cone-shaped bunches of fruit. Pinot noir grapes are grown around the world, mostly in the cooler climates, and the grape is chiefly associated with the Burgundy region of France. Pinot noir is now used to make red wines around the world, as well as Champagne, sparkling white wines such as the Italian Franciacorta, and English sparkling wines. Regions that have gained a reputation for red Pinot noir wines include the Willamette Valley of Oregon; the Carneros, Central Coast, Sonoma Coast, and Russian River AVAs of California; the Elgin and Walker Bay wine regions of South Africa; the Mornington Peninsula, Adelaide Hills, Great Southern, Tasmania, and Yarra Valley in Australia; and the Central Otago, Martinborough, and Marlborough wine regions of New Zealand. Pinot noir is the most-planted varietal (38%) used in sparkling wine production in Champagne and other wine regions. Pinot noir is a difficult variety to cultivate and transform into wine. The grape's tendency to produce tightly packed clusters makes it susceptible to several viticultural hazards involving rot that require diligent canopy management. The thin skins and low levels of phenolic compounds lends pinot to producing mostly lightly colored, medium-bodied and low-tannin wines that can often go through phases of uneven and unpredictable aging. When young, wines made from Pinot noir tend to have red fruit aromas of cherries, raspberries, and strawberries. As the wine ages pinot has the potential to develop more vegetal and ""barnyard"" aromas that can contribute to the complexity of the wine."
"Syrah (/ˈsiːrɑː/), also known as Shiraz, is a dark-skinned grape variety grown throughout the world and used primarily to produce red wine. In 1999, Syrah was found to be the offspring of two obscure grapes from southeastern France, Dureza and Mondeuse Blanche. Syrah should not be confused with Petite Sirah, a cross of Syrah with Peloursin dating from 1880. The style and flavor profile of wines made from Syrah are influenced by the climate where the grapes are grown with moderate climates (such as the northern Rhone Valley and parts of the Walla Walla AVA in Washington State) tending to produce medium to full-bodied wines with medium-plus to high levels of tannins and notes of blackberry, mint and black pepper. In hot climates (such as Crete, and the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale regions of Australia), Syrah is more consistently full-bodied with softer tannin, jammier fruit and spice notes of licorice, anise and earthy leather. In many regions the acidity and tannin levels of Syrah allow the wines produced to have favorable aging potential. Syrah is used as a single varietal or as a blend. Following several years of strong planting, Syrah was estimated in 2004 to be the world's 7th most grown grape at 142,600 hectares (352,000 acres). It can be found throughout the globe from France to New World wine regions such as: Chile, South Africa, the Hawke's Bay, Waiheke, New Zealand, California and Washington. It can also be found in several Australian wine regions such as: Barossa, Heathcote, Coonawarra, Hunter Valley, Margaret River and McLaren Vale."
"Gaglioppo is a red wine grape that is grown in southern Italy, primarily around Calabria. The vine performs well in drought conditions but is susceptible to oidium and peronospora. The grape produces wine that is full-bodied, high in alcohol and tannins with a need for considerable time in the bottle for it to soften in character. It is sometimes blended with up to 10% white wine."
"Poulsard (also Ploussard) is a red French wine grape variety from the Jura wine region. The name Ploussard is used mainly around the town of Pupillin but can appear on wine labels throughout Jura as an authorized synonyms. While technically a dark-skinned noir grape, the skins of Poulsard are very thin with low amounts of color -phenols and produces very pale colored red wines, even with extended maceration and can be used to produce white wines. Because of this, Poulsard is often blended with other red-skin varieties or used to produce lightly colored rosé wines. Additionally the grape is used to make blanc de noir white wines and sparkling cremants. Poulsard is an authorized grape variety in the Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) wines of Arbois AOC, Côtes du Jura AOC, Crémant du Jura AOC, L'Etoile AOC and Macvin du Jura AOC. Outside Jura, Poulsard is also grown in Bugey AOC of the Ain département in eastern France."
"Vespolina is a red Italian wine grape variety that is planted in Piedmont around Gattinara and Ghemme. Ampelographer believe that the grape is most likely indigenous to this area of Piedmont and recent DNA profiling identified a parent-offspring relationship with Nebbiolo. Outside Piedmont it is found in the Lombardy region of Oltrepò Pavese where the grape is known as Ughetta. In Gattinara, Vespolina is sometimes blended with Nebbiolo and Bonarda Piemontese. Unlike the white Italian grape Vespaiolo, the root of the name Vespolina does not have a direct connection with vespe or wasp. However the true origins of the name are still unclear."
"Gamay is a purple-colored grape variety used to make red wines, most notably grown in Beaujolais and in the Loire Valley around Tours. Its full name is Gamay Noir à Jus Blanc. It is a very old cultivar, mentioned as long ago as the 15th century. It has been often cultivated because it makes for abundant production; however, it can produce wines of distinction when planted on acidic soils, which help to soften the grape's naturally high acidity."
Peloursin is red French wine grape variety best known for crossing with Syrah to make the red wine grape Durif (known in the United States as Petite Sirah). The variety is believed to have originated in Isère from the northern Rhône-Alpes region. Today Peloursin can be found in some quantities in California and in the Australia wine region of Victoria.
"Gamaret is a variety of red wine grape. It was created by at Station Fédérale de Recherches en Production Végétale de Changins in 1970 by crossing Gamay and Reichensteiner. Gamaret was developed for cultivation in French Switzerland, and is a full sibling of Garanoir, which was intended for the German part of the country. Total Swiss plantations of the variety in 2009 stood at 380 hectares (940 acres). Gamaret has good resistance to rot and ripens early. It gives dark purple wine with aromas of blackberries and spices and subtle tannin."
"Abbuoto is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown primarily in the Lazio region of central Italy. Historically the grape was believed to be responsible for the Ancient Roman wine Caecubum that was praised by writers such as Pliny the Elder and Horace but historians and wine experts such as Jancis Robinson and Julia Harding note that connection is likely erroneous. The grape is primarily used as a blending variety where it often contributes body, phenolics and high alcohol levels. As of 2000, there were 717 hectares (1,772 acres) of the grape planted in Italy. Some ampelographers suspect that the Lazio grape variety San Giuseppe nero may be related to (or possibly a clone) of Abbuoto but so far DNA analysis has not yet confirmed such suspicions."
"Ruby Cabernet is a red Olmo grape variety that is a cross between Cabernet Sauvignon and Carignan, it can produce wines with good colour and a pleasant cherry flavour, but is mostly blended into bulk wines. The purpose for the creation of the crossing of the grape varieties utilized to produce Ruby Cabernet was to obtain the superior quality of a Cabernet wine, and the resistance to heat of the Carignan combined in an inexpensive table wine. Even though the wine made from these grapes does not possess the distinctive flavor and the overall structure of other types of Cabernet wines, it does carry their fruitful essence. The grape for this type of red wine was developed for California's hot climate, specially for regions such as the San Joaquin and the Napa Valleys. Ruby Cabernet has improved the quality of the bulk wines produced in these areas thanks to its natural, special acidity."
Diolinoir is a variety of red wine grape. It was created by at Station Fédérale de Recheres en Production Végétale de Changins in 1970 by crossing and Pinot noir. Total Swiss plantations of the variety in 2009 stood at 112 hectares (280 acres). Diolinoir has very good resistance to rot and has an intermediate ripening time. It is more often used in cuvées than on its own.
"Tinta Amarela or Trincadeira is a red wine grape that is commonly used in Port wine production. The grape is noted for its dark coloring. Its use in the Douro region has been increasing in recent years. The vine is susceptible to rot and performs better in dry, hot climates. It is one of the most widely planted grape varieties in Portugal. It is the oldest and most widely planted grape variety in the Alentejo region, where it is called Trincadeira. The wine tends to be full-bodied and rich, with aromas of blackberries, herbs and flowers."
"Grignolino (Italian: [ɡriɲɲoˈliːno]) is a red Italian wine grape variety commonly grown in the Piedmont region. It makes light colored wines and rosés with very fruity aromas, strong acidity and tannins. The name Grignolino derives from the word grignole which means ""many pips"" in the local Piedmontese dialect of the Asti region. The abundance of pips, or seeds, contributes to the strong, bitter tannins associated with the wine. Modern winemakers try to avoid the excess tannins with gentle and slow pressings. Grignolino has three Denominazione di origine controllata (DOCs) that produce wine from it - Asti, , and Piemonte Grignolino."
"Tressot or Tressot noir is a variety of dark-skinned wine grape. Tressot has historically been grown in Burgundy but it is now almost extinct. Some small plantations still remain in the Chablis district of Burgundy. The grape has been identified as a cross between Duras and Petit Verdot. Duras is a traditional French grape variety currently found only in the Tarn valley northeast of Toulouse. Petit Verdot is one of the classic grapes of Bordeaux. In the literature it is often confused with the grape variety Trousseau, which is also known as Bastardo"
Négrette is a dark red wine grape grown primarily in South West France in the region between Albi and Toulouse.
"Canaiolo (Italian: [kanaˈjoːlo]; also called Canaiolo nero or Uva Canina) is a red Italian wine grape grown through Central Italy but is most noted in Tuscany. Other regions with plantings of Canaiolo include Lazio, Marche and Sardegna. In Umbria a white berried mutation known as Canaiolo bianco exists. Together with Sangiovese and Colorino it is often used to create Chianti wine and is an important but secondary component of Vino Nobile di Montepulciano. In the history of Chianti it has been a key component blend and during the 18th century may have been the primarily grape used in higher percentage than Sangiovese. Part of its popularity may have been the grape's ability to partially dry out without rotting for use in the governo method of prolonging fermentation. In the 19th century, the Chianti recipe of Bettino Ricasoli called for Canaiolo to play a supporting role to Sangiovese, adding fruitiness and softening tannins without detracting from the wine's aromas. In the aftermath of the phylloxera epidemic, the Canaiolo vines did not take well to grafting onto new American rootstock and the grape began to steadily fall out of favor. As of 2006, total plantings of Canaiolo throughout Italy dropped to under 7,410 acres (3,000 hectares). Today there are renewed efforts by Tuscan winemakers to find better clonal selections and re-introduce the variety into popular usage. A white sub-variety exists, known as Canaiolo bianco, which is a permitted grape variety in the Umbrian wine region of Orvieto where is known as Drupeggio. In recent years plantings have been declining."
"Pignolo (Italian: [piɲˈɲɔːlo]) is a red Italian wine grape grown predominantly in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region of northeast Italy. Believed to have been cultivated in the hills of Rosazzo, the grape is now a prominent variety in the Colli Orientali del Friuli Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC). In Italian the grape's name originates from pigna (pine cone), because the grapes are dense like pine cones. The first recorded mention of the grape was in Abbot 's late 17th century book Bacchus in Friuli in which he described the grape making ""excellent black wine"". Today the grape is used to make rich, deep colored, full bodied wine that does well with some time in oak. Well made examples of the wine have good balance between the grape's acidity and tannins with flavor notes of plum and blackberry. Most experts believe that it is not related to the Lombardy grape of the Valtellina region."
"Teroldego is a red Italian grape variety grown primarily in the northeastern region of Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, Italy."
"Marzemino is a red Italian wine grape variety that is primarily grown around Isera, south of Trentino. The wine is most noted for its mention in the opera Don Giovanni of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (""Versa il vino! Eccellente Marzimino!""). The vine ripens late and is susceptible to many grape diseases including oidium. Wine produced from the grape has a characteristic dark tint and light plummy taste. Ampelographers have long theorized that the grape originated in northern Italy. Recent DNA profiling conducted at the research facility in San Michele all'Adige revealed Marzemino to have a parent-offspring relationship with the grapes Marzemina bianca in the Veneto, Refosco dal Peduncolo Rosso and Teroldego, from Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Trentino respectively, which gives further evidence to its likely origins in this region."
"Uva di Troia is a red wine grape variety grown in the Italian region of Apulia, particularly in the areas around Andria and Barletta, and in the Province of Bari. The name probably derives from the town of Troia in the Province of Foggia the legendary founder of which was the Greek hero Diomedes, after he had destroyed the ancient Troy. Other names which have been used at various times include: Nero di Troia, Sumarello, Uva di Canosa, Uva di Barletta, Troiano, Tranese, and Uva della Marina."
"Croatina is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown primarily in the Oltrepò Pavese region of Lombardy and in the Province of Piacenza within Emilia Romagna, but also in parts of Piedmont and the Veneto. In the Oltrepò Pavese, in the hills of Piacenza, in Cisterna d’Asti and San Damiano d’Asti (Province of Asti), and in Roero this variety is called ‘Bonarda’. It should not, however be confused with the Bonarda piemontese, which is an unrelated vine. In the Piedmont region, it is sometimes blended with Nebbiolo in the wines of Gattinara and Ghemme."
"Trepat is a red Catalan wine grape variety that is grown primarily in the Conca de Barberà and Costers del Segre Denominación de Origen (DO)s of Catalonia. Ampelographers believe that the grape is likely indigenous to Northeastern Iberian Peninsula. Today there are approximately 1,500 hectares (3,700 acres) of the variety, used mostly for light rosé."
"Prieto Picudo is one of the major wine grapes from the Spanish denomination of origin (DO) Tierra de León. It is a varietal that delivers deeply colored wines, with a clean acidity and high levels of sugar and tannin. This concentration gives Prieto Picudo wines a unique character and taste."
"Listán Negro (not to be confused with Listán Prieto) is a red Spanish wine grape variety that is widely planted in the Canary Islands, particularly on the island of Tenerife where it is a permitted variety in the Denominaciones de Origen (DO) wines of Tacoronte-Acentejo, Valle de la Orotava, Ycoden-Daute-Isora, and Valle de Güímar. It is also permitted in the Spanish wine regions of El Hierro, Gran Canaria, La Gomera, La Palma, Lanzarote. Across the Canary Islands more than 5,000 hectares (12,000 acres) are planted to the variety. In 2007, DNA fingerprinting done by the in Madrid, Spain discovered that the Mission grape that was widely planted in the earliest New World vineyards in the America was a genetic match to Listán Prieto. Despite the genetic match, there is enough clonal variation that has occurred over the centuries of geographical separation that the Mission grape of the Americas and the Listán Prieto grape of the Canary Islands are classified by the Vitis International Variety Catalogue as two separate grape varieties. Part of the variation is likely because some of earliest plantings by the Spanish missionaries were from grape seeds which are the result of pollination and sexual propagation and thus more likely to have slight differences from the parent vine than propagation through cuttings."
"Fortana (also known as Canina nera) is a red Italian wine grape variety grown primarily in the Emilia–Romagna region of northern Italy. A permitted grape variety in several Denominazione di origine controllatas (DOCs), mostly in Emilia, Fortana mostly contributes tartness and acidity in red blends."
Tinta Francisca is a red wine grape found primarily in the Douro DOC and is sometimes used in Port wine production. The grape is often confused with the similarly named Touriga Francesa. There are some theories that the grape may be related to Pinot noir but no ampelographical link has yet been discovered between the two varieties. The grape is known for its sweet perfume but has less concentration than other Port grapes.
"Tinta Barroca is a Portuguese red wine grape that is grown primarily in the Douro region with some plantings in South Africa. In Portugal, it is a common blending grape in Port wine while in South Africa it is normally made into a varietal wine or blend with other grapes. The vine was introduced to the Douro region in the late 19th century and has the advantages of being able to withstand cool conditions while planted on north-facing slopes."
"Abrusco is a red Italian wine grape variety grown primarily in the Tuscany region where it is a minor blending component permitted in the wines of Chianti. The grape has long history in the region and was mentioned in 1600, under its synonyms Abrostino and Colore, in the posthumously published work by Italian agronomist Giovan Vettorio Soderini Trattato della coltivazione delle viti, e del frutto che se ne può cavare. There Soderini notes that the grape was often used to add deeper, more red color to Tuscan wines. The variety is considered quite rare and is close to extinction with only 6 hectares (15 acres) of the grape variety reported in the 2000 Italian census. The Tuscan producer has worked to keep the variety still viable, producing a limited production Indicazione geografica tipica (IGT) wine made of 100% Abrusco from 20 vines that were discovered growing among other varieties in an old vineyard owned by the winery. Another Tuscan producer Ferlaino is also working with the centre of research and development for Tuscany to produce wines of 100% Abrusco from 0.2 hectares of land on their estate in Cetona, Siena."
"Fer (also known as Fer Servadou, Pinenc, Mansois and several other synonyms) is a red French wine grape variety that is grown primarily in South West France and is most notable for its role in the Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) wines of Gaillac, Marcillac and Béarn but can also be found as minor component in the wines of Madiran, Cabardès and Bergerac. The grape is also featured in red blends from several vin de pays regions in the south west with significant plantings coming from the Aveyron department. According to wine expert Oz Clarke, wine made from Fer is often characterized by its perfumed aromas of currants and red fruit, soft tannins, and concentration in fruit. The grape is not related to the clone of Malbec known as Fer that is widely planted throughout Argentina. The name Fer is French for iron (Latin Ferrum), a reference to the very hard and ""iron-like"" wood of the vine's above ground canopy. Because of this very hard wood stock, the vine can be difficult to prune and trellis."
Merille is a red French wine grape variety that is grown primarily in the Garonne of South West France. It is a common grape in table wine.
"Chasselas or Chasselas blanc is a wine grape variety grown mainly in Switzerland, France, Germany, Portugal, Hungary, Romania, New Zealand, Croatia and Chile. Chasselas is mostly vinified to be a full, dry and fruity white wine. It is also suitable as a table grape, grown widely for this purpose in Turkey and Hungary."
"The sultana is a ""white"" (pale green), oval seedless grape variety also called the sultanina, Thompson Seedless (United States), Lady de Coverly (England), and oval-fruited Kishmish (Iraq, Iran, Israel, Palestine, India). It is also known as İzmir üzümü (grape of İzmir) in Turkey since this variety has been extensively grown in the region around İzmir. It is assumed to originate from (Asia Minor), which later became part of the Ottoman Empire. In some countries, especially Commonwealth countries, it is also the name given to the raisin made from it or from larger seedless grapes; such sultana raisins are often simply called sultanas or sultanis. These are typically larger than Zante currants (which are also a kind of dried grape, not currants in the botanical sense), and the Thompson variety is smaller than many seeded raisins. In the US and Canada, the name ""raisin"" is applied to all dried grapes, so that the breakfast cereal known as ""sultana bran"" in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom is called raisin bran in the United States and Canada. Thompson sultana raisins are small and sweet and have a golden colour. Another seedless grape variety from the former Ottoman Empire, the round-fruited Kishmish, is also dried to make a larger sultana raisin."
"Table grapes are grapes intended for consumption while fresh, as opposed to grapes grown for wine production, juice production, or for drying into raisins. Vitis vinifera table grapes can be in the form of either seeded or non-seeded varietals and range widely in terms of colour, size, sweetness and adaptability to local growing conditions. Common commercially available table grape varieties such as Thompson Seedless and Flame Seedless are favoured by growers for their high yield and relative resistance to damage during shipment. Other less common varietals such as Cotton Candy, Kyoho or Pione are custom hybrids bred for size, appearance and specific flavour characteristics."
"The Noah grape is a cultivar derived from the grape species Vitis labrusca or 'fox grape' which is used for table, juice and wine production. Noah has berries of a light green/yellow and has medium-sized, cylindrical-conical, well formed fruit clusters with thick bloom similar to those of . Although popularly classified as Vitis labrusca, Noah is the result of a 50/50 cross between (Vitis riparia) and an unknown Vitis labrusca with other reports claiming the labrusca to be . The vines are moderately vigorous and moderately cold hardy. It buds late with secondary buds being fruitful and ripens approximately at the same time as Concord. Noah is very disease resistant and shows resistance to mildew, black rot and phylloxera – it is used as a rootstock."
"Fetească Albă (Romanian pronunciation: [feˈte̯askə ˈalbə]) is a Romanian - Moldovan white grape variety, mainly cultivated in the regions of Moldova and Transylvania in Romania and Republic of Moldova, as well as in the Hungarian wine region of Eger. In Moldova, it uses the biggest area planted among local varieties - 900 hectares (2,200 acres). This grape is used a lot for sparkling wine production, but also for varietal Fetească wine."
"The Muscat family of grapes includes over 200 grape varieties belonging to the Vitis vinifera species that have been used in wine production and as raisin and table grapes around the globe for many centuries. Their colors range from white (such as Muscat Ottonel), to yellow (Moscato Giallo), to pink to near black (Muscat Hamburg). Muscat grapes and wines almost always have a pronounced sweet floral aroma. The breadth and number of varieties of Muscat suggest that it is perhaps the oldest domesticated grape variety, and there are theories that most families within the Vitis vinifera grape variety are descended from the Muscat variety. Among the most notable members of the Muscat family are Muscat blanc à Petits Grains, which is the primary grape variety used in the production of the Italian sparkling wine Asti (also known as Moscato Asti) made in the Piedmont region. It is also used in the production of many of the French fortified wines known as vin doux naturels. In Australia, this is also the main grape used in the production of Liqueur Muscat, from the Victorian wine region of Rutherglen. Young, unaged and unfortified examples of Muscat blanc tend to exhibit the characteristic Muscat ""grapey"" aroma as well as citrus, rose and peach notes. Fortified and aged examples (particularly those that have been barrel aged) tend to be very dark in color due to oxidation with aroma notes of coffee, fruit cake, raisins and toffee. Muscat of Alexandria is another Muscat variety commonly used in the production of French vin doux naturel, but it is also found in Spain, where it is used to make many of the fortified Spanish Moscatels. Elsewhere it is used to make off-dry to sweet white wines, often labeled as Moscato in Australia, California and South Africa. In Alsace and parts of Central Europe, Muscat Ottonel is used to produce usually dry and highly perfumed wines."
Pinot blanc is a white wine grape. It is a point genetic mutation of Pinot noir. Pinot noir is genetically unstable and will occasionally experience a point mutation in which a vine bears all black fruit except for one cane which produces white fruit.
"Boal is a name given to several varieties of grape cultivated in Portugal, notably in the production of medium-rich fortified wines from Madeira Island. On many wine labels of Madeira wine, the variety's name is anglicized as Bual. Madeira from Bual is typically less sweet than that from Malmsey, but more sweet than Sercial or Verdelho. The vines are also common in Portugal and Spain, where the fruit is used in the same way for fortified wines."
"Furmint is a white Hungarian wine grape variety that is most noted widely grown in the Tokaj-Hegyalja wine region where it is used to produce single-varietal dry wines as well as being the principal grape in the better known Tokaji dessert wines. It is also grown in the tiny Hungarian wine region of Somló. Furmint plays a similar role in the Slovakian wine region of Tokaj. It is also grown in Austria where it is known as Mosler. Smaller plantings are found in Slovenia where it is known as Šipon. The grape is also planted in Croatia, where it is known as Moslavac. It is also found in Romania and in former republics of the Soviet Union. Furmint is a late ripening variety. For dry wines the harvest starts usually in September, however sweet wine specific harvest can start in the second half of October or even later, and is often affected by Botrytis. The name Furmint may have been taken from the word froment for the wheat-gold color of the wine it produces. While it is possible that the grape was brought to Hungary in the 13th century during the reign of King Béla IV, ampelographers believe that the grape is likely native to the region."
"Zierfandler is a grape variety used to make white wine in the Thermenregion of Austria. It is also known as Spätrot (""late red"") because it turns red just before harvest time. It is traditionally blended with Rotgipfler but is increasingly being sold as a varietal wine. Zierfandler wines are typically elegant and quite sweet, but with much balancing acidity and a nutty bouquet of pistachios and almonds. They are capable of ageing well."
"Gamay Blanc Gloriod is an obscure French variety of white wine grape. Very little of it is grown commercially. It is named after Émile Gloriod, who discovered it as a seedling; it was originally thought to be a white version of the Gamay grape. ""Gamay Blanc"" was already used as an alternative name for Chardonnay, which is another white grape that looks like Gamay."
Aubin blanc (or simply Aubin) is a white wine grape from the upper reaches of the Moselle valley in eastern France.
"Muscat Ottonel or Muskat-Ottonel (in Germany) is a white wine grape variety that is a member of the Muscat family of Vitis vinifera. It is most notable for its use in dessert wines from Austria, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Serbia as well as dry wines from Alsace and Hungary. In Alsace, the varietal designation Muscat d'Alsace is allowed for the varieties Muscat Ottonel, Muscat blanc à petit grains and Muscat rose à petit grains blended in any combination -or not- (but not for other members of the Muscat family), and blends between these are not allowed for most Alsace Grands Crus. First cultivated in Alsace by the Loire grower in 1852, Muscat Ottonel is believed to be a cross of Chasselas with Muscat de Saumur (which was originally given as ""Muscat d'Eisenstadt"")."
"The Kerner grape is an aromatic white grape variety. It was bred in 1929 by August Herold by crossing Trollinger (a red variety also known as Schiava grossa or Vernatsch) and Riesling. Herold was working at a plant breeding station in Lauffen in the Württemberg region of Germany. This station belonged to a state breeding institute headquartered in Weinsberg. It received varietal protection and was released for general cultivation in 1969. Kerner has been named in honour of a poet and physician from Swabia, Justinus Kerner, whose works included songs and poetry on wine. Kerner lived from 1818 to his death in Weinsberg. In 2006 Kerner was the 8th most planted variety in Germany with 4,004 hectares (9,890 acres) and 3.9% of the total vineyard surface. The trend since the mid-1990s is that German plantations of Kerner decrease, just as the case for all other ""new breeds"" of white varieties, such as Müller-Thurgau and Bacchus. German plantations of Kerner reached their highest point around 1990, with around 8,000 hectares (20,000 acres) and 7.5% of the total German vineyard surface. For a while around 1995 it was in fact the third most planted variety in Germany after Riesling and Müller-Thurgau. Kerner is most commonly planted in the German regions of Palatinate, Rheinhessen, Mosel, and Württemberg, but it is also grown in Austria (Styria), Switzerland, the island of Hokkaido in Japan, Old Mission Peninsula in Michigan, and the Italian province of South Tyrol. It was introduced into South Tyrol in the early 1970s and awarded Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) status in 1993."
"Auxerrois blanc (pronounced [o.sɛʁ.wa blɑ̃]) or Auxerrois Blanc de Laquenexy is a white wine grape that is important in Alsace, and is also grown in Germany and Luxembourg. It is a full sibling of Chardonnay that is often blended with the similar Pinot blanc."
"Marsanne is a white wine grape, most commonly found in the Northern Rhône region. It is often blended with Roussanne. In Savoie the grape is known as grosse roussette. Outside France it is also grown in Switzerland (where it is known as ermitage blanc or just ermitage), Spain (where it is known as Marsana), Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States."
"Morio Muscat (also known as Morio-Muskat) is a white wine grape that was created by viticulturalist at the Geilweilerhof Institute for Grape Breeding in the Palatinate in 1928. He claimed to have crossed the varieties Silvaner and Pinot blanc, but based on the variety's properties it has been speculated that he actually crossed Silvaner and Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains. But so far this speculation has yet to be conclusively proven. The grape is highly aromatic with a ""grapey"" characteristic reminiscent of Muscat grape varieties. The grape is rarely used for varietal wines because it requires a high level of ripeness to avoid producing wine with a ""mousey"" flavor, a coarse texture and overabundance of acidity."
"The Bacchus is a white wine grape created by viticulturalist at the Geilweilerhof Institute for Grape Breeding in the Palatinate in 1933. He crossed a Silvaner x Riesling cross with Müller-Thurgau. Bacchus received varietal protection and was released for general cultivation in 1972. Its name is taken from Roman name of the Greek wine god Dionysus. Bacchus can reach high must weights, and has no high requirement for sites it can be planted and can grow where Riesling, for example, does not ripen reliably. It ripens early, about the same time as Müller-Thurgau, and has a high productivity similar to that variety. Bacchus wines can have powerful flavours and character, which have even been described as ""exuberant"", but only if it is allowed to ripen fully. It is low in acidity, which does not always make it very well suited for varietal wines under typical German growing conditions. Among the new breeds, it is considered to give less elegant wines than Kerner. Therefore, Bacchus is often used for blending into Müller-Thurgau, to give the latter more flavour. Within Germany, Franconia is considered as the source of some of the more successful varietal Bacchus wines. Bacchus is also increasingly grown in several vineyards in England. The colder climate in England means that grapes retain a higher acidity and yields are lower. Bacchus can give varietal wines of reasonable quality, somewhat in a Sauvignon blanc-like style. German plantations peaked in the 1990 at around 3,500 hectares (8,600 acres) of which more than half were in Rheinhessen, where it was popular to use in QbA blends. In 2006 there were 2,113 hectares (5,220 acres) of Bacchus left in Germany, 2.1% of the total vineyard surface."
"Clairette blanche is a white wine grape variety most widely grown in the wine regions of Provence, Rhône and Languedoc in France. At the end of the 1990s, there were 3,000 hectares (7,400 acres) of Clairette blanche grown in France, although volumes are decreasing. Clairette blanche was often used to make vermouth, to which it is suited as it produces wine high in alcohol and low in acidity, and therefore yields wines that are sometimes described as ""flabby"" and which tend to oxidize easily. These problems have sometimes been partially overcome by blending it with high-acid varieties such as Piquepoul blanc. It is allowed into many appellations of Southern Rhône, Provence and Languedoc. The white wines and Clairette du Languedoc are made entirely from Clairette blanche, while the sparkling wine Clairette de Die can also contain Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains. Clairette blanche is frequently used in the blended white Vin de pays from Languedoc. It is also one of the thirteen grape varieties permitted in the Châteauneuf-du-Pape appellation. With 2.5% of the appellation's vineyards planted in Clairette blanche in 2004 it is the most common white variety in Châteauneuf-du-Pape, slightly ahead of Grenache blanc. Outside France it is also grown in South Africa for sparkling wine, Australia and Sardinia."
"Chenin blanc (known also as Pineau de la Loire among ) is a White wine grape variety from the Loire Valley of France. Its high acidity means it can be used to make everything from sparkling wines to well-balanced dessert wines, although it can produce very bland, neutral wines if the vine's natural vigor is not controlled. Outside the Loire it is found in most of the New World wine regions; it is the most widely planted variety in South Africa, where it was historically also known as Steen. The grape may have been one of the first to be grown in South Africa by Jan van Riebeeck in 1655, or it may have come to that country with Huguenots fleeing France after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. Chenin blanc was often misidentified in Australia as well, so tracing its early history in the country is not easy. It may have been introduced in James Busby's collection of 1832, but C. Waterhouse was growing Steen at Highercombe in Houghton, South Australia, by 1862. It provides a fairly neutral palate for the expression of terroir, vintage variation and the winemaker's treatment. In cool areas the juice is sweet but high in acid with a full-bodied fruity palate. In the unreliable summers of northern France, the acidity of under ripened grapes was often masked with chaptalization with unsatisfactory results, whereas now the less ripe grapes are made into popular sparkling wines such as Crémant de Loire. The white wines of the Anjou AOC are a popular expression of Chenin as a dry wine, with flavors of quince and apples. In nearby Vouvray AOC they aim for an off-dry style, developing honey and floral characteristics with age. In the best vintages the grapes can be left on the vines to develop noble rot, producing an intense, viscous dessert wine which may improve considerably with age."
"Garganega (Italian: [ɡarˈɡaːneɡa], Venetian: [ɡaɾˈɡaneɡa]; meaning ""from Gargano"") is a variety of white Italian wine grape widely grown in the Veneto region of North East Italy, particularly in the provinces of Verona and Vicenza. It is Italy's 6th most widely planted white grape. It forms the basis of Venetian white wine Soave and is also a major portion of the blend used to make . DNA typing studies in 2003 and 2008 have confirmed that the Grecanico Dorato (Grecanico) grape of Sicily is identical to Garganega. Already before these studies, ampelographers believed the grapes to be related due to the similarities of clusters, berries and leaf characteristics."
"Grillo, also known as Riddu and Rossese bianco, is a white Italian wine grape variety that withstands high temperatures and is widely used in Sicilian winemaking and, in particular, for making Marsala. Its origins are uncertain, but it may have been introduced into the island of Sicily from Apulia. It was already widely planted in the Province of Trapani by 1897; today it may be grown throughout Sicily and also in the Aeolian Islands. The grape also found growing around the commune of Riomaggiore in the province of La Spezia in Liguria, where it is known as Rossese bianco."
"Zalema is a white Spanish wine grape variety planted mainly in Condado de Huelva. As a varietal, Zalema produces heavy, full bodied wines."
Alarije is a minor variety of white wine grape from Spain. It is most often used in blends.
"Parellada (Catalan pronunciation: [pəɾəˈʎaðə]) is a Spanish white grape variety of Catalan origin specially grown in Catalonia, Spain. With Macabeu and Xarel·lo, it is one of the three traditional varieties used to make the sparkling wine Cava, which is primarily produced in Catalonia. Besides its use in Cava, it is used mostly for blending in young white wines, although some more ambitious oaked blends with Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc are also used. Spanish plantations stood at 10,000 hectares (25,000 acres) in 2004, Its good acidity and freshness make these wines extremely suitable for the aperitif. A prime example of this is the micro-distilled Obsello Absinthe which, in addition to being produced in the same region, uses the wine of these grapes in its base spirit."
"Godello is a white variety of wine grape grown in northwestern Spain, in particular in Galicia. The Gouveio found in northern Portugal is thought to be the same grape variety. The origins of Godello variety are located in the town of Godella (Valencia) where this variety was first planted back in the 19th century by a local landowner in their plantation of Campo Olivar by the Baron of this township. In the early 1920s the vineyards were transported by a Galician trader who took several samples up to Galicia. Godello can produce fine white wines, and yields the best results in Valdeorras, where plantations have increased after having previously been in decline. Total Spanish plantations of Godello stood at 1,153 hectares (2,850 acres) in 2008 (up from 880 hectares (2,200 acres) in 2004)."
"Elbling is a variety of white grape (sp. Vitis vinifera) which today is primarily grown in the upstream parts of the Mosel region in Germany and in Luxembourg, where the river is called Moselle. The variety has a long history, and used to cover much of Germany's vineyards from medieval times and was that country's most cultivated variety until the early 20th century, but has been in decline ever since. As of 2006, there were 583 hectares (1,440 acres) of Elbling vineyards in Germany, which made it the country's 23rd most grown variety of grape. Of that vineyard surface, 575 ha or 98.6% was found in the Mosel region In the same year, there were 122.9 hectares (304 acres) of Elbling grown in Luxembourg."
"Ortega is a grape variety used for white wine. It was created in 1948 by Hans Breider at the Bayerischen Landesanstalt für Wein-, Obst- und Gartenbau in Würzburg and was released with varietal protection in 1981. It is a cross between Müller-Thurgau and Siegerrebe. Breider chose to name the variety in honour of the Spanish poet and philosopher José Ortega y Gasset. Ortega ripens early, is not sensitive to frost and reaches quite high must weights, typically 20 degrees Oechsle higher than Müller-Thurgau. It is therefore often used for sweet wines, which are considered to improve with cellaring. Ortega wines have aromas of Muscat and peach and are high in extract. Ortega is also used as a table grape. In 2016, there were 475 hectares (1,170 acres) of Ortega in Germany, with a decreasing tendency."
"Mauzac or Mauzac blanc a white variety of grape used for wine, of the species Vitis vinifera. It is mainly grown in the Gaillac and Limoux regions in the southwest of France. Total French plantations of Mauzac stood at 3,200 hectares (7,900 acres) in the year 2000. In Gaillac its aromatic wines are blended with Len de l'El to create mildly sweet and sparkling white blended wines. Since the late 1980s, some Gaillac producers have created an interest in Mauzac by producing better wines. In Limoux, Mauzac is a compulsory part of the Blanquette de Limoux, where it may be blended with Chenin blanc and Chardonnay. However, in Limoux, plantations of Mauzac are decreasing at it is losing ground to Chardonnay. The grape is also one of the seven permitted white varieties in Bordeaux wine. Mauzac buds and ripens late, and was traditionally picked quite late, when temperatures had dropped in Limoux. This allowed for slow fermentation which preserved residual sugar for a ""natural"" second fermentation in the spring, creating a sparkling wine. Today, it is more common to pick Mauzac earlier, giving a more crisp wine with higher acidity, but also without much of its particular aromas."
"Madeleine Royale is a variety of white grape. It is mostly grown for table grapes or ornamental purposes, but is notable as a parent of Müller-Thurgau and Madeleine Angevine. It ripens extremely early, in some cases by the 22 July, the feast day of Mary Magdalene - hence the name."
"Riesling (/ˈriːzlɪŋ/; German: [ˈʁiːslɪŋ]) is a white grape variety which originated in the Rhine region. Riesling is an aromatic grape variety displaying flowery, almost perfumed, aromas as well as high acidity. It is used to make dry, semi-sweet, sweet, and sparkling white wines. Riesling wines are usually varietally pure and are seldom oaked. As of 2004, Riesling was estimated to be the world's 20th most grown variety at 48,700 hectares (120,000 acres) (with an increasing trend), but in terms of importance for quality wines, it is usually included in the ""top three"" white wine varieties together with Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc. Riesling is a variety which is highly ""terroir-expressive"", meaning that the character of Riesling wines is greatly influenced by the wine's place of origin. In cool climates (such as many German wine regions), Riesling wines tend to exhibit apple and tree fruit notes with noticeable levels of acidity that are sometimes balanced with residual sugar. A late-ripening variety that can develop more citrus and peach notes is grown in warmer climates (such as Alsace and parts of Austria). In Australia, Riesling is often noted for a characteristic lime note that tends to emerge in examples from the Clare Valley and Eden Valley in South Australia. Riesling's naturally high acidity and pronounced fruit flavors give wines made from the grape exceptional aging potential, with well-made examples from favorable vintages often developing smokey, honey notes, and aged German Rieslings, in particular, taking on a ""petrol"" character. In 2015, Riesling was the most grown variety in Germany with 23.0% and 23,596 hectares (58,310 acres), and in the French region of Alsace with 21.9% and 3,350 hectares (8,300 acres). In Germany, the variety is particularly widely planted in the Mosel, Rheingau, Nahe and Pfalz wine regions. There are also significant plantings of Riesling in Austria, Slovenia, Serbia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Luxembourg, northern Italy, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, China, Ukraine, and the United States (Washington, California, Michigan and New York)."
"Sercial is the name of a white grape grown in Portugal, especially on the island of Madeira. It has given name to the dryest of the four classic varieties of Madeira fortified wine. The grape is grown in diminishing quantities at the southern end of the island. After phylloxera devastated Madeira's vineyards, the grape became more common on the mainland, where it is known, somewhat curiously, as Esgana or Esgana Cão, meaning respectively Strangler or Dog Strangler. Its late ripening allows it to retain its characteristic acidity. The anglicised name Sercial came to be associated with the Madeira style rather than the grape variety, being the lightest, most acidic and delicate expression of Madeira that takes the longest to mature. EU rules for varietal names on wine labels now require Madeiras labelled Sercial to be made from minimum 85% Sercial. For obscure reasons, Sercial was the name given to the Gascony grape Ondenc when it was planted in Australia."
"Verdelho is a white wine grape grown throughout Portugal, though most associated with the island of Madeira, and also gives its name to one of the four main types of Madeira wine. At the turn of the 20th century it was the most widely planted white grape in Madeira."
"Himrod is a white table grape, released in 1952 by the New York Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, New York. It is seedless and known for ripening quickly and its sweet flavor. Himrod is considered very productive and reliable. Himrod resulted from a cross of by Thompson Seedless, a particularly successful cross which resulted in the eventual release of four cultivars, the others being , , and Lakemont. All were named for towns in the Finger Lakes region, near Geneva. These grapes are all quite productive, but they have some differences."
"Malingre Précoce is a white variety of grape of French origin used primarily as table grape and to some extent for wine. It was first cultivated by a French gardener named Malingre in the vicinity of Paris around 1840, who created it from seedlings of unknown origin. The term ""précoce"" indicates early ripening, and because of this property Malingre Précoce finds some use in . Malingre Précoce has been used as a crossing partner for many other grape varieties, including Madeleine Angevine and Zarya Severa."
"(in Hungarian), also called Lipovina (in Slovak), Frunza de tei (in Romanian), Lindenblättriger (in German) and Feuille de Tilleul (in French) is a grape variety from the Pontian Balcanica branch of Vitis vinifera. The name refers to the ""lime (tree) leaf"" in each of these languages. The grape is native to the Carpathian Basin and is planted in several Hungarian wine regions, but most prominently in the tiny wine region of Somló, and especially in Tokaj-Hegyalja, where it is blended with Furmint to produce Tokaji Aszú and other dessert wines. The grape is also planted in the Slovakian wine region of Tokaj where it is used to produce similar wines. Vinified as a pure varietal dry wine, Hárslevelű is capable of yielding a dense, full-bodied, green-gold wine with an intense aroma of spice, pollen and elderflowers. Hárslevelű is also planted in South Africa."
"Irsai Olivér is a Hungarian white wine variety, cross-bred between and Pearl of Csaba in 1930. It ripens early and has a distinctive Muscat character."
"Juhfark is a variety of grape, of the species Vitis vinifera. The name in Hungarian literally means sheep's tail. The term refers to the elongated, cylindrical shape of the clusters. The grape is mainly planted in Hungary, most prominently in the tiny wine region of Somló."
"Kéknyelű is a white Hungarian wine grape planted primarily in the Badacsony wine region near Lake Balaton. The grape produces full bodied, smokey wines. It was assumed to be identical with the Italian grape variety Picolit. Nonetheless, in 2006 isoenzymes and microsatellite analyses have confirmed that these two cultivars are different."
"Glera, also known as Prosecco, is a white variety of grape of Slovenian origin, which was brought to the village of Prosecco (Slovene: Prosek) from the Karst region. The variety was formerly mostly referred to as Prosecco, but in the EU was renamed ""Glera"" in 2009 to make room for the protection of ""Prosecco"" as the name of a geographically-protected wine. Glera is a rather neutral grape variety which is mainly cultivated for use in sparkling Italian wine styles, frizzante or spumante, from the various Prosecco DOCG and DOC areas, although still wines also exist. It is grown mainly in the Veneto region of Italy, traditionally in an area near Conegliano and Valdobbiadene, in the hills north of Treviso."
"Verdicchio (/vɛərˈdiːkioʊ/, also US: /vɜːrˈ-, -kjoʊ, vɛərˈdɪkioʊ/, Italian: [verˈdikkjo]) is a white Italian wine grape variety grown primarily in the Marche region of central Italy. The name Verdicchio derives from verde (or ""green"") and refers to the slight green/yellow hue that wines made from the grape can have. Verdicchio is the principal grape behind two Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) wines produced in the provinces of Macerata and Ancona, Verdicchio di Matelica and Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi. In addition to producing still wines, Verdicchio grapes are also used to make sparkling wine and straw wine."
"Sauvignon vert (also known as Sauvignonasse or Friulano) is a white wine grape of the species Vitis vinifera prevalent in the Italian region of Friuli. It is widely planted in Chile where it was historically mistaken for Sauvignon blanc. The grape is distinct from the California planting of Muscadelle which is also called Sauvignon vert. Friulano from Friuli-Venezia Giulia was known as “Tocai” Friulano until March 31, 2007 when the European Court of Justice of Luxembourg set the prohibition of using the name “Tocai” in the name of the wine (as stipulated in a 1993 agreement between the European Union and Hungary). Since 2007 Tocai Friulano is merely known as “Friulano” in Friuli and is labeled as such. The main confusion in Europe of the name Tocai Friulano is due to the Hungarian wine known as Tokaji (Hungarian of Tokaj) which does not have any Tocai Friulano in it at all, and is composed typically of the following grapes: Furmint (70%), Hárslevelű (20–25%), and Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains (5–10%). Hungary does not want anyone confusing the dry and aromatic Italian Tocai Friulano (which is a unique wine in itself) with their wine called Tokaji. Some believe that early editions of Tocai Friulano in Italy were most likely made of the grape Furmint. The first record of a “new” Tocai, probably made from Sauvignonasse, is documented only in 1932. The Pinot grigio vine, which is also prevalent in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, was once known by the synonym Tokay d'Alsace in Alsace, but there is no connection between Tocai Friulano (Sauvignon vert) and Pinot grigio."
"Arneis is a white Italian wine grape variety originating from Piedmont, Italy. It is most commonly found in the hills of the Roero, northwest of Alba, where it is part of the white Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) wines of Roero. It can also be used to produce DOC wines in Langhe. Arneis (literally: little rascal, in Piemontese) is so called because it is regarded as a somewhat difficult variety to grow. It is a crisp and floral varietal, and has been grown for centuries in the region. The white wines made from the Arneis grape tend to be dry and full bodied with notes of pears and apricots."
"Picolit (also known as Piccolit and Piccolito) is a white Italian wine grape grown in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region of northeast Italy. The grape is allowed in the Denominazione di origine controllata e garantita (DOCG) wines of Colli Orientali del Friuli. The grape is most commonly associated with sweet dessert wines often made in the passito style. Historically planted in poor and infertile vineyards, the grape gets its name from the very small stalk, which in friulian language is called pecolèt or pecolùt. The grape had a worldwide reputation in the 18th century when it was featured in royal courts from Great Britain to the Russian Empire. While experiencing cult wine popularity in the 1960s & 1970s, Picolit's extremely small yields have made it economically difficult to grow and has limited the number of plantings. It was assumed to be identical with the Hungarian grape variety Kéknyelű. But in 2006 isoenzymes and microsatellite analyses have confirmed that these two cultivars are different."
"Trebbiano is an Italian wine grape, one of the most widely planted grape varieties in the world. It gives good yields, but tends to yield undistinguished wine. It can be fresh and fruity, but does not keep long. Also known as ugni blanc, it has many other names reflecting a family of local subtypes, particularly in Italy and France. Its high acidity makes it important in Cognac and Armagnac productions."
"Chardonnay (UK: /ˈʃɑːrdəneɪ/, US: /ˌʃɑːrdənˈeɪ/, French: [ʃaʁdɔnɛ]) is a green-skinned grape variety used in the production of white wine. The variety originated in the Burgundy wine region of eastern France, but is now grown wherever wine is produced, from England to New Zealand. For new and developing wine regions, growing Chardonnay is seen as a ‘rite of passage’ and an easy entry into the international wine market. The Chardonnay grape itself is neutral, with many of the flavors commonly associated with the wine being derived from such influences as terroir and oak. It is vinified in many different styles, from the lean, crisply mineral wines of Chablis, France, to New World wines with oak and tropical fruit flavors. In cool climates (such as Chablis and the Carneros AVA of California), Chardonnay wine tends to be medium to light body with noticeable acidity and flavors of green plum, apple, and pear. In warmer locations (such as the Adelaide Hills and Mornington Peninsula in Australia and Gisborne and Marlborough region of New Zealand), the flavors become more citrus, peach, and melon, while in very warm locations (such as the Central Coast AVA of California), more fig and tropical fruit notes such as banana and mango come out. Wines that have gone through malolactic fermentation tend to have softer acidity and fruit flavors with buttery mouthfeel and hazelnut notes. Chardonnay is an important component of many sparkling wines around the world, including Champagne and Franciacorta in Italy. Chardonnay's popularity peaked in the late 1980s, then gave way to a backlash among those wine connoisseurs who saw the grape as a leading negative component of the globalization of wine. Nonetheless, it is one of the most widely planted grape varieties, with 210,000 hectares (520,000 acres) worldwide, second only to Airén among white wine grapes and fifth among all wine grapes."
"Vermentino is a light-skinned wine grape variety, primarily found in Italian wine. It is widely planted in both Sardinia and Liguria, to some extent in Corsica, in Piedmont under the name Favorita, and in increasing amounts in Languedoc-Roussillon. The leaves are dark green and pentagonal. The grapes are amber-yellow and hang in pyramidal bunches. The vines are often grown on slopes facing the sea where they can benefit from the additional reflected light. The Vitis International Variety Catalogue now gives Italy as its origin. The most famous wine made from Vermentino is probably the DOCG (and ) which is produced in the province of Olbia-Tempio, in the north of Sardinia. The grape is said to have been cultivated in this part of Gallura, often under the name Arratelau, since the fourteenth century. Elsewhere on the island the grape is used for a variety of white wines, including sweet and sparkling variants."
"Fetească Regală (Romanian pronunciation: [feˈte̯askə reˈɡalə]) is a white grape variety, created in the 1930s, in Mureș County, Romania. It is a natural crossing of Grasă and Fetească albă. This variety is cultivated mainly in Romania (Transylvania, Western Moldavia), as well as in Moldova, Slovakia, Hungary and Austria. The quality of wines ranges between table wine and high-quality ones. The wines are dry and fresh and have acidity and specific flavour."
"Airén is a variety of Vitis vinifera, a white grape commonly used in winemaking. This grape is native to Spain where it represents almost a quarter of all grapes grown. As of 2010, Airén was estimated to be the world's 3rd most grown grape variety in terms of planted surface, at 252,000 hectares (620,000 acres), down from 306,000 hectares (760,000 acres) in 2004, where it held 1st place, although it is almost exclusively found in Spain. Since Airén tends to be planted at a low density, several other varieties (including Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot) are more planted in terms of number of vines."
"Albariño (Galician pronunciation: [alβaˈɾiɲʊ]) or Alvarinho (Portuguese: [aɫvaˈɾiɲu]) is a variety of white wine grape grown in Galicia (northwest Spain) and Northwest Portugal (Monção and Melgaço), where it is also used to make varietal white wines. Albariño is the Galician name for the grape; in Portugal it is known as Alvarinho, and sometimes as Cainho Branco. It was presumably brought to Iberia by Cluny monks in the twelfth century but recent studies point to albariño/alvarinho being native to Galicia-Portugal. Both the Galician name ""Albariño"" and Portuguese ""Alvarinho"" derive from albo<albus, meaning ""white, whitish"". It has locally been thought to be a Riesling clone originating from the Alsace region of France, although earliest known records of Riesling as a grape variety date from the 15th, rather than the 12th, century. It is also theorized that the grape is a close relative of the French grape Petit Manseng. It should not be confused with the grape of Madeira."
"Loureira, Loureiro or Loureiro Blanco is a white wine grape cultivated in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula. This includes Galicia, Spain and Minho, Portugal. In the latter, it is notably cultivated along the Lima River, a sub-region of Vinho Verde (wines produced in Minho)."
"Albillo or Albillo Real is a white Spanish wine grape variety planted primarily in the Ribera del Duero region, and also in Madrid, Ávila and Galicia. The grape has mostly neutral flavors with a light perfume aroma. It has a high glycerol index which confers smoothness to the wines. It is sometimes added to the red wines of the Ribera del Duero for added aromatics. The berries are of average size, round in shape and golden in colour. The grape bunches are generally small and compact. It is an early ripening variety and in central Spain is usually harvested in mid August. It is an authorized variety in the Ribera del Duero region and one of the main varieties in the Vinos de Madrid DO."
"Merseguera is a white Spanish wine grape variety planted primarily in the Alicante, Jumilla and Valencia regions."
"Xarel·lo (Catalan pronunciation: [ʃəˈɾɛlːu]) is a white grape variety of Spanish origin specially grown in Catalonia. With Macabeo and Parellada, it is one of the three traditional varieties used to make the sparkling wine cava. Spanish plantations stood at 8,043 hectares (19,870 acres) in 2008. Xarel·lo wine can be strongly flavored and is more aromatic than the other two cava grape varieties. While historically the grape was only produced as part of regional blend in Penedès and Cava, modern winemaking has evolved in the last 20 years to where it is being seen in the form of varietal wines. High-end Cavas have been produced which feature the grape prominently such as Gramona's Enoteca or then as 100% of the finished wine in: Sabaté i Coca's Reserva Familiar, Recaredo's Turó d'en Mota and Mas del Serral from Raventos i Blanc."
"Macabeo, also called Viura or Macabeu (Catalan: [məkəˈβew], French: [makabø]), is a white variety of wine grape. It is widely grown in the Rioja region of northeastern Spain, the Cava producing areas south of Barcelona, and the Languedoc-Roussillon region of France. Spanish plantations stood at nearly 45,000 hectares (110,000 acres) in 2015, making it the second most grown white grape variety in Spain. In France, plantations accounted for 2,800 hectares (6,900 acres) in 2007.Since 2009, some Macabeo is grown in Israel."
"Pedro Ximénez (also known as PX and many other variations) is the name of a white Spanish wine grape variety grown in several Spanish wine regions but most notably in the denominación de origen (DO) of Montilla-Moriles. Here it is used to produce a varietal wine, an intensely sweet, dark, dessert sherry. It is made by drying the grapes under the hot sun, concentrating the sweetness (similar to straw wine production), which are then used to create a thick, black liquid with a strong taste of raisins and molasses that is fortified and aged in solera. Historically Pedro Ximénez is grown in Australia to make fortified wines and sherry type wines known by the Australian term - Apera. It is often used for blending and to make botrytised dessert wines and still lends itself in the Swan Valley to the making of dessert wine today. This grape variety has thrived in Western Australia's Swan Valley since its introduction there due to the hot climate growing conditions. The vine requires a rich soil and short pruning. James Busby brought some Pedro Ximénez to Australia in 1832. Some were imported from Jerez and planted at Clarendon; a transfer from the Sydney Botanic Garden is recorded in around 1839. Pedro Giménez (Pedro Jiménez) is a widely grown criolla variety in South America whose relationship to Pedro Ximénez is uncertain, as it shows ampelographic differences."
"Garrido Fino is a white wine grape grown mainly in the province of Huelva, in the region of Andalusia, Spain."
"Palomino Fino is a white grape widely grown in Spain and South Africa, and best known for its use in the manufacture of sherry. It is also grown in the Douro region of Portugal where it is used for table and fortified wines."
"Torrontés is a white grape variety, mostly produced and known in Argentine wine, producing fresh, aromatic wines with moderate acidity, smooth texture and mouthfeel as well as distinctive peach and apricot aromas on the nose. Three Torrontés varieties exist in Argentina: Torrontés Riojano, the most common, Torrontés Sanjuanino, and Torrontés Mendocino. It is primarily Torrontés Riojano that has received attention for the quality of its wines, and is the variety used for most Argentine wines simply labeled Torrontés. The three grapes are relatively similar but do have some noticeable differences. Torrontés Riojano and Torrontés Sanjuanino both tend to have large loose bunches of pale grapes while Torrontés Mendocino, however, has smaller, tighter bunches of darker yellow grapes. Torrontés Riojano is the most aromatic of the three, with aromas reminiscent of Muscat and Gewürtztraminer wines. The least aromatic, and least widely planted, is Torrontés Mendocino with the aromatics and plantings of Torrontés Sanjuanino falling in between. All three Argentine Torrontés varieties belong to the Criollas group of grape varieties, which is a term used for presumably American-born cultivars of the European grapevine Vitis vinifera. Around 8,700 hectares (21,000 acres) in Argentina have been planted with Torrontés Riojano, and 4,850 hectares (12,000 acres) with Torrontés Sanjuanino. Plantings in the very high altitudes (1700m+) of the Calchaquíes Valleys in the far north of Argentina have recently met with success. The vine is highly productive and is just under ten percent of all white grape plantings, however as a varietal, it made up almost 20 percent of all white wine sold in Argentina in 2008. The Salta region in northwest Argentina is particularly noted for its Torrontés as the grape thrives in cold dry, windswept conditions."
"Grüner Veltliner (Green Veltliner) is a white wine grape variety grown primarily in Austria, Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic. The leaves of the grape vine are five-lobed with bunches that are long but compact, and deep green grapes that ripen in mid-late October in the Northern Hemisphere. In 2008, Grüner Veltliner plantations in Austria stood at 17,151 hectares (42,380 acres), and it accounts for 32.6% of all vineyards in the country, almost all of it being grown in the northeast of the country. Thus, it is the most-planted grape variety in Austria. Some is made into sparkling wine in the far northeast around Poysdorf. Along the Danube to the west of Vienna, in Wachau, Kremstal and Kamptal, it grows with Riesling in terraces on slopes so steep they can barely retain any soil. The result is a very pure, mineral wine capable of long aging, that stands comparison with some of the great wines of the world. In recent blind tastings organized by the Austrian Wine Marketing Board, Grüner Veltliners have beaten world-class Chardonnays from the likes of Mondavi and Maison Louis Latour. Outside of Austria, Grüner Veltliner is the second most widely grown white grape variety in the Czech Republic, encompassing approximately 2,120 hectares (5,200 acres) and resulting in approximately 11% of Czech wine production. In recent years a few US wineries have started to grow and bottle Grüner Veltliner, including wineries and vineyards in Massachusetts, Oregon, Maryland, the North Fork of Long Island AVA and Finger Lakes AVA regions of New York State, Napa Valley, Clarksburg AVA, Monterey AVA and Santa Ynez Valley AVA in California, Ashtabula County, Ohio, Southern New Jersey winery Bellview Winery, Pennsylvania, and along the Lake Michigan Shore AVA of Southwest Michigan. Gruner Veltliner is also planted in Australia, particularly in the region in South Australia, as well as the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia, Canada. Some ampelographers (such as in his 1887 handbook of ampelography) have long assumed that Grüner Veltliner is not related to the other varieties with ""Veltliner"" in their name (such as Roter Veltliner), or that it is only distantly related. A first DNA analysis in the late 1990s secured Savagnin (Traminer) as one parent of Grüner Veltliner, but was not able to identify the other parent among the candidates studied. The other parent was later found to be an originally unnamed variety of which only a single, abandoned, very old and weakened vine was found in outside Eisenstadt in Austria. The grape is therefore referred to as or ""St. Georgen-vine"". Grüner Veltliner has a reputation of being a particularly food-friendly wine and is a popular offering on restaurant wine lists. It is made into wines of many different styles - much is intended for drinking young in the Heuriger (bars serving new wine) of Vienna, a little is made into sparkling wine, but some is capable of long aging. The steep vineyards of the Danube (Donau) west of Vienna produce very pure, mineral Grüner Veltliners intended for laying down. Down in the plains, citrus and peach flavors are more apparent, with spicy notes of pepper and sometimes tobacco."
"Dimyat (Bulgarian: димят) is a white Bulgarian wine grape. It is one of Bulgaria's most widely planted white grape varieties, second only to Rkatsiteli. Wines made from this variety are noted for their perfume aromas. While some ampelographers believe that the variety is indigenous to Bulgaria, legends have developed around Dimiat being named after a town in the Nile Delta and was brought back to Europe by Crusaders in the Middle Ages."
"Knipperlé is a traditional French variety of white wine grape from Alsace. It's not listed for use in AOC wine, but is a minor component of blends for local drinking, in some ways an Alsatian equivalent of its sibling Aligoté in Burgundy."
"Verdejo is a variety of wine grape that has long been grown in the Rueda region of Spain. The grape originated in North Africa, and was spread to Rueda in about the 11th Century, possibly by Mozarabs. Verdejo was generally used to make a strongly oxidized, Sherry-like wine. In the 1970s, the winemaking company began to develop a fresher style of white wine based on Verdejo with the help of French oenologist Émile Peynaud. In 1980, white wines from the Rueda region were recognized by a Denominación de Origen (DO). Wines labeled Rueda must contain 50% Verdejo; the remainder is typically Sauvignon blanc or Macabeo. Wines designated ""Rueda Verdejo"" must contain 85% Verdejo, and are often 100% Verdejo. The Verdejo grapes are generally harvested at night. This means that the grapes enter the cellar at the lower night-time temperature of 10–15 °C (50–59 °F) instead of the daytime temperature, which can be as high as 28–30 °C (82–86 °F) in September. Lower temperatures means less oxidation, or browning of the juice. Verdejo wines are aromatic, often soft, and full-bodied."
"Gros Manseng (sometimes translated: Large Manseng, rarely ""Big Manseng"") is a white wine grape variety that is grown primarily in South West France, and is part of the Manseng family. It produces dry wines in the Jurançon and Béarn regions of Southwest France. In Gascony it is permitted in the Pacherenc du Vic-Bilh Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC), in the Côtes de Gascogne and in the Floc de Gascogne."
Treixadura or Trajadura is white Portuguese wine grape variety grown primarily in the Vinho Verde wine region of northeast Portugal and the Galician wine regions of Ribeiro and Rías Baixas in Spain where the variety is known as Treixadura. The grape is primarily a blending variety that adds body and light lemony aromatics to wines. It is most commonly blended with Loureiro and Alvarinho in Rías Baixas while in Ribeiro it is often blended with Torrontés and .
"Amigne is a white Swiss wine grape planted primarily in the Valais region, with most of the plantations in Vetroz. Total Swiss plantations of the variety in 2009 stood at 43 hectares (110 acres). The grape can make rich, full bodied wines. Dry Amigne wines are powerful with linden aromas, and it is also used for sweet dried grape wines, which tend to have citrus fruit and bitter almond aromas. DNA profiling at UC Davis has indicated a parent-offspring relationship between Amigne and Petit Meslier, which was unexpected from a classical ampelographic point of view. (It was previously believed to be related to Petite Arvine.)"
"Petit Manseng (sometimes translated: Small Manseng, rarely ""Little Manseng"") is a white wine grape variety that is grown primarily in South West France. It produces the highest quality wine of any grape in the Manseng family. The name is derived from its small, thick skin berries. Coupled with the small yields of the grapevine, most Petit Manseng farmers produce around 15 hl of wine per hectare. The grape is often left on the vine till December to produce a late harvest dessert wine. The grape is grown primarily in Gascony, Jurançon and Pacherenc du Vic-Bilh but has recently drawn interest in New World wine regions like California, North Georgia, Virginia, and Ohio. In May 2020, CSIRO scientists discovered through DNA analysis that Australia's plantings of Petit Manseng, first imported in 1979, are in fact Gros Manseng. The reason is that it is expected to follow Viognier's path to popularity among white wine drinkers. It was already present in Uruguay, when Basque settlers brought ""Manseng"" and Tannat vines with them to their new home. Despite being easily recognizable as a white grape while true Manseng is a black grape, wine that is Petit Manseng is still normally labeled as just ""Manseng"". The grape is often left on the vine to produce a late harvest wine made from its nearly raisin like grapes."
"Folle blanche, also known as Picpoule, Gros Plant, and Enrageat blanc, is a wine grape variety from southwest France. It was the traditional grape variety in Cognac and Armagnac production until the 20th century. Folle blanche is an offspring of Gouais blanc, with the other parent so far unidentified. It has been mostly replaced by its hybrid offspring Baco blanc due to phylloxera damage. Baco blanc (also known as Baco 22 A) is a cross of Folle blanche and the Vitis riparia × Vitis labrusca hybrid Noah. Folle blanche is also the parent of the very hardy and disease-resistant Baco 1 (or Baco noir), a cross of Folle blanche and a Vitis riparia variety. Baco noir and Baco 22 A, like Folle blanche and their other parents, produce a very acid wine. This makes them more suited to distillation than less acidic grapes. Folle blanche is used in the Loire Valley area and in Brittany around Nantes to produce , a very dry and often tartly acidic wine that pairs well with shellfish. There it is used both in the production of table wine as well as eau de vie."
"Ansonica or Inzolia is a white Italian wine grape planted primarily in western Sicily where it can be used to produce Marsala wine. The grape is noted for its nutty aroma. In Tuscany, the grape is known as Ansonica. It is the chief (and potentially only) component of the Tuscan D.O.C. Ansonica Costa dell'Argentario, which is located on the extreme southern coast of Tuscany and on the island of Giglio. Ansonica can also be found in the following DOC wines: Calabria: Bivongi DOC; Sicily: Alcamo DOC, DOC, Contessa Entellina DOC, DOC, Erice DOC, or DOC, Marsala DOC, Menfi DOC, Monreale DOC, Riesi DOC, Salaparuta DOC, Sambuca di Sicilia DOC, Santa Margherita di Belice DOC, Sciacca DOC, Vittoria DOC; Tuscany: Ansonica Costa dell'Argentario DOC, Elba DOC, Parrina DOC and DOC."
"Gringet is an autochthonous white wine grape from Haute-Savoie, France that is used as both a blending grape and for varietal wines. It is mainly used in the sparkling wine production.The wine grape grown on the hills above the lower Vallee de l'Arve, in the French Alps (Haute-Savoie). It is unique to the region and there is no link with Savagnin or any Traminer variety."
"Sauvignon blanc is a green-skinned grape variety that originates from the Bordeaux region of France. The grape most likely gets its name from the French words sauvage (""wild"") and blanc (""white"") due to its early origins as an indigenous grape in South West France. It is possibly a descendant of Savagnin. Sauvignon blanc is planted in many of the world's wine regions, producing a crisp, dry, and refreshing white varietal wine. The grape is also a component of the famous dessert wines from Sauternes and Barsac. Sauvignon blanc is widely cultivated in France, Chile, Romania, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Bulgaria, the states of Washington and California in the US. Some New World Sauvignon blancs, particularly from California, may also be called ""Fumé Blanc"", a marketing term coined by Robert Mondavi in reference to Pouilly-Fumé. Depending on the climate, the flavor can range from aggressively grassy to sweetly tropical. In cooler climates, the grape has a tendency to produce wines with noticeable acidity and ""green flavors"" of grass, green bell peppers and nettles with some tropical fruit (such as passion fruit) and floral (such as elderflower) notes. In warmer climates, it can develop more tropical fruit notes but risks losing much aroma from over-ripeness, leaving only slight grapefruit and tree fruit (such as peach) notes. Wine experts have used the phrase ""crisp, elegant, and fresh"" as a favorable description of Sauvignon blanc from the Loire Valley and New Zealand. Sauvignon blanc, when slightly chilled, pairs well with fish or cheese, particularly chèvre. It is also known as one of the few wines that can pair well with sushi. Along with Riesling, Sauvignon blanc was one of the first fine wines to be bottled with a screwcap in commercial quantities, especially by New Zealand producers. The wine is usually consumed young and does not particularly benefit from aging, as varietal Sauvignon blancs tend to develop vegetal aromas reminiscent of peas and asparagus with extended aging. Dry and sweet white Bordeaux, including oak-aged examples from Pessac-Léognan and Graves, as well as some Loire wines from Pouilly-Fumé and Sancerre are some of the few examples of Sauvignon blancs with aging potential. The first Friday in May is International Sauvignon Blanc Day."
"Erbaluce or Erbaluce bianca is a white Italian wine grape grown primarily in the Piedmont region around Caluso, in Canavese. In addition to dry table wines, it is used to make sweet wines with deep golden coloring, such as passito. The grape has a long history in the Piedmont region, with the first written record dating to 1606, and most likely originated in the alpine hills of northern Piedmont. In the 21st century, DNA profiling determined that Erbaluce has a close genetic relationship with another Piedmontese wine grape, Cascarolo bianco, though the exact nature of that relationship is not yet known."
"Len de l'El (various spellings have been reported: Len de l'Elh, Len del El, Lendelel, Loin-de-l'oeil ; also known as cavalié or cavalier) is a white French wine grape variety native to South West France. Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) regulation dictate that the white wines from Gaillac must include at least 15% Len de l'El blended with Mauzac, though there has been movements to allow substitution of Sauvignon blanc (and since 2007 growers have been officially permitted to do so). Prior to the phylloxera epidemic, Len de l'El constituted more than 30% of all plantings in the Gaillac region. But the grapes are prone to rot and have been declining in plantings in recent times. The wines made from the grape are typically full bodied with low acidity but powerful fruit notes."
"Ondenc is a white French wine grape found predominantly in the Gaillac region of southwest France. In the 19th century, it was a popular planting in Bordeaux but fell out of favor following the phylloxera epidemic due to poor yields and sensitivity to grape disease, though is still one of the seven white varieties permitted in Bordeaux. Prior to falling out of favor, vine cuttings were brought from Bordeaux to Australia where the grapes became known under the synonyms of Irvine's White in Victoria and Sercial in South Australia. The Australian grapes weren't identified as Ondenc till 1976 when French ampelographer identified the vine while visiting Australia. Today, the grape is nearly extinct in Australia except for a small amount of plantings in Victoria used in sparkling wine production."
"Dinka or Kövidinka is a white Hungarian wine grape. There is also significant plantings near the Hungarian border in Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia."
"Sylvaner or Silvaner is a variety of white wine grape grown primarily in Alsace and Germany, where its official name is Grüner Silvaner. While the Alsatian versions have primarily been considered simpler wines, it was recently (2006) included among the varieties that can be used to produce Alsace Grand Cru wine together with the four 'noble grapes' of Alsace, although only in one vineyard, Zotzenberg. This dichotomy is explained by the vigour of the Sylvaner vine and the grape's neutral flavour, which can lead to blandness unless yields are controlled. On the other hand, it gives a blank canvas for the expression of terroir, and on good sites with skilled winemaking, Sylvaner can produce elegant wines. It has high acidity but naturally reaches high must weights, so is often blended with other varieties such as Riesling or Elbling, and is sometimes made into a dessert wine."
"Petite Arvine is a white wine grape planted in the Valais region of Switzerland. Total Swiss plantations of the variety in 2009 stood at 154 hectares (380 acres). Ampelographers revealed it to have originated in the Valais region in Switzerland and grown since 1602. Designation: AOC Valais Petite Arvine has a reputation as a high-class grape variety, and is seen as the best white wine grape of the Valais. Its wines are rich in extract and are found as dry, medium-dry and sweet wines.This textured wine contains a generous amount of extract from its thick-skinned berries. The ambassador of wines from the Valais. Here is what you can expect from Petite Arvine. Taste: Fragrant and fruity. Fruit: Notes of grapefruit and lime. Acidity: Elevated acidity. Tannin: Little to no bitterness. ""The vintners regard it so highly that they've dedicated an entire village to it."" Fully, Switzerland – Official Swiss tourism website. Overall, wines produced from this varietal are made of very high quality. Derived from Latin the name indicates the vine comes from the Savoyard Arve Valley in the Valais."
Baroque (often spelled Barroque) is a white French wine grape planted primarily in South West France around the Tursan region. It can make full bodied wines with nutty flavors. Ampelographers suspect that the grape maybe a crossing of Folle Blanche (which it shares the synonym Bordeleza zuria with) and Sauvignon blanc.
"Bombino bianco is a white Italian wine grape variety planted primarily along Italy's Adriatic coast line, most notably in Apulia. The vine is prone to high yields and often produces neutral flavor wines. The grape is known under many synonyms throughout Italy including Debit and Pagadebit, names which came from the grape's reputation for being a high yielding and reliable crop for vineyard owners to grow that would assure them that on each vintage they could pay off their debts. The exact origins of the grape are unknown, with early wine texts speculating that the grape may have originated in Spain. Today most ampelographers believe that the grape is indigenous to southern Italy, with Apulia believed to be the most likely home of the grape. In the 20th century DNA profiling has shown that while Bombino bianco is closely related to Bombino nero, the grape is not color mutation but its own distinct variety. Though Bombino bianco shares many synonyms with Trebbiano Toscano (also known as Ugni blanc), the two grapes are unrelated. DNA research has also shown that Bombino bianco may be one of the parent varieties of the grape of the Ostuni DOC in Apulia andof the grape that is also native to the same region. In the Abruzzo wine region, Bombino bianco has been historically associated with Trebbiano d'Abruzzo but in recent years ameplographers have been beginning to doubt that the two grape varieties are the same. Since 1994, the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) called Trebbiano d'Abruzzo has listed both grapes as separate varieties permitted in the blend of the white wine. In the European Union it is permitted for the production of bulk table wines and vermouth as well as raisins. It is also imported into Germany for use in as a blending variety for inexpensive sparkling Sekt."
"Melon de Bourgogne or Melon is a variety of white grape grown primarily in the Loire Valley region of France. It is also grown in North America. It is best known through its use in the white wine Muscadet. In the U.S., Federal law prevents ""Muscadet"" from being used for American-produced wine; only the full name of the grape, or the shortened ""Melon"" can be used."
"Viognier (French pronunciation: ​[vjɔɲje]) is a white wine grape variety. It is the only permitted grape for the French wine Condrieu in the Rhône Valley. Outside of the Rhône, Viognier can be found in regions of North and South America as well as Australia, New Zealand, the Cape Winelands in South Africa and Israel. In some wine regions, the variety is co-fermented with the red wine grape Syrah where it can contribute to the color and aroma of the wine. Like Chardonnay, Viognier has the potential to produce full-bodied wines with a lush, soft character. In contrast to Chardonnay, the Viognier varietal has more natural aromatics that include notes of peach, pears, violets and minerality. However, these aromatic notes can be easily destroyed by too much exposure to oxygen, which makes barrel fermentation a winemaking technique that requires a high level of skill on the part of any winemaker working with this variety. The potential quality of Viognier is also highly dependent on viticultural practices and climate, with the grape requiring a long, warm growing season in order to fully ripen but not a climate that is so hot that the grape develops high levels of sugars and potential alcohol before its aromatic notes can develop. The grape is naturally a low-yielding variety, which can make it a less economically viable planting for some vineyards."
"Sémillon is a golden-skinned grape used to make dry and sweet white wines, mostly in France and Australia. Its thin skin and susceptibility to botrytis make it dominate the sweet wine region Sauternes AOC and Barsac AOC."
"Aligoté is a white grape used to make dry white wines, especially in the Burgundy region of France where it was first recorded in the 18th century. Since it is tolerant to cold, this variety is also cultivated in Eastern European countries. In 2004, it was the 22nd most planted vine variety in the world at 45,000 hectares (110,000 acres)."
"Müller-Thurgau is a white grape variety (sp. Vitis vinifera) which was created by Hermann Müller from the Swiss Canton of Thurgau in 1882. It is a crossing of Riesling with Madeleine Royale. It is used to make white wine in Germany, Austria, Northern Italy, Hungary, England, Australia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, Belgium and Japan. There are around 42,000 hectares (104,000 acres) cultivated worldwide, which makes Müller-Thurgau the most widely planted of the so-called ""new breeds"" of grape varieties created since the late 19th century. Although plantings have decreased significantly since the 1980s, as of 2006 it was still Germany's second most planted variety at 14,000 hectares and 13.7% of the total vineyard surface. In 2007, the 125th anniversary was celebrated at the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute. Müller-Thurgau is also known as Rivaner (Austria, Germany, Luxembourg, and especially for dry wines), Riesling x Sylvaner, Riesling-Sylvaner, Rizvanec (Slovenia) and Rizlingszilváni (Hungary)."
"Savagnin or Savagnin blanc (not to be confused with Sauvignon blanc) is a variety of white wine grape with green-skinned berries. It is mostly grown in the Jura region of France, where it is made into Savagnin wine or the famous vin jaune and vin de paille."
"Scheurebe or Sämling 88 is a white wine grape variety. It is primarily grown in Germany and Austria, where it often is called Sämling 88 (English: Seedling 88), and some parts of the New World. Scheurebe wines are highly aromatic, and the variety is often used for sweet wines, although dry Scheurebe wines have become more common in Germany."
"Colombard (also known as French Colombard in North America) is a white French wine grape variety that is the offspring of Chenin blanc and Gouais blanc. This makes the grape the sibling of the Armagnac Meslier-Saint-François and the nearly extinct Cognac grape Balzac blanc. In France it was traditionally grown in the Charentes and Gascony for distilling into Cognac and Armagnac respectively. Today it is still among the permitted white grape varieties in Bordeaux wine, and in Gascony for Vins de Pays Côtes de Gascogne and the white Floc de Gascogne. aperitif drink. The wine is known for its distinctive flavours of Guava. Old vine grapes are crushed by some northern Californian producers and made into a fruity white wine of interesting character in both dry and sweet versions. This grape is mainly grown in California to provide backbone, due to its natural acidic character, for white ""jug wine"" blends. It is also widely grown in South Africa, where it is known as Colombar, and to a lesser extent in Australia and Israel."
"Catarratto is a white Italian wine grape planted primarily in Sicily where it is the most widely planted grape. Catarratto can make full bodied wines with lemon notes. In the Etna DOC, the grape is often blended with Minella bianca and Carricante."
"Niagara grapes are a variety of the North American grape species Vitis labrusca (botanical family Vitaceae) and are used as table grapes and for wines, as well as jams and juice. Niagara is the leading green grape grown in the United States. A purple variety, known as ""pink"" niagara (niágara rosada), exists and is the main niagara cultivated in southern Brazil, principally in the states of São Paulo, where the variety first occurred in 1933, and Rio Grande do Sul. The Niagara grape was created in Niagara County, New York, in 1868 when and cross-bred Concord grapes with white Cassady grapes. It was first sold commercially in 1882. Niagara grapes are considered to be poor shipping grapes, and so are usually only found near where they are grown. They are most commonly found in the United States in New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Michigan, Washington, and Ohio, and are also grown in Ontario in Canada, as well as in Brazil, and New Zealand. While only rarely available fresh outside these areas, Niagara grapes are well known to most American consumers as the source of most white grape juice."
"Edelweiss is a very winter-hardy wine grape variety, pale green in color, derived from crossing the Minnesota 78 and grapes. It was developed by Elmer Swenson in 1980 in cooperation with the University of Minnesota. The clusters are large and rather loose, weighing a pound or more. Early picking of the grape is essential for making a wine. Should Edelweiss not be harvested early, the completely ripe Vitis labrusca flavoring becomes too strong for the palate of most. Edelweiss was first developed as a table grape. This variety bears the Minnesota winters, but mulching is encouraged. During this process be wary when tying the shoots together because they break easily. Edelweiss has strong resistance to grape disease and fungus and can tolerate negative thirty-five degree temperatures. Nebraska's premiere grape is Edelweiss. The wineries in the state have won numerous awards nationwide with their Edelweiss wines."
"Albarola is a white Italian wine grape variety grown in the northwest Italy. It is most commonly found in the Liguria region where producers in the Cinqueterre Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) use it as a blending component. Wine expert Jancis Robinson describes the wine made from Albarola as fairly ""neutral"" in profile. Outside of Liguria, the grape was historically grown in Sicily but for most of the 20th century has been declining in plantings along with other ancient Sicilian varieties like Albanello, , Minella bianca and Montonico bianco."
"Pecorino is a white Italian wine grape variety that grows in the Marche, Abruzzo, Tuscany, Umbria and Lazio regions of Italy. Ampelographers believe that the grape is likely native to Marche, where the soil destined for this cultivation increases every year. This grape variety is used to produce the DOCG (Denominazione di origine controllata e garantita) wines, like the Offida Pecorino DOCG, and the DOC (Denominazione di origine controllata) wines, like the Falerio dei Colli Ascolani, the Colli Maceratesi and the Falerio dei Colli Ascolani. Today, more than 20 qualities of wine are derived from this grape."
"Tempranillo blanco is a white Spanish wine grape variety that is grown in the Rioja Denominación de Origen (DOC). It is a mutation of the red Tempranillo grape variety that is planted in Rioja. The white grape variety was discovered in a Tempranillo vineyard in the Rioja region by a wine grower in the late 20th century. In 2007, the Consejo Regulador of Rioja officially sanctioned the use of Tempranillo blanco in the DOC wines of Rioja."
"Doña Blanca (Spanish ""White Lady"", also known as Dona Branca in Portuguese) is a white Spanish and Portuguese grape variety that is grown primarily in the northwest Galicia region of Spain and throughout Portugal from the Douro northward. The variety is a permitted grape in the Spanish Denominación de Origens (DOs) of Valdeorras and Monterrei in Galicia and Bierzo in nearby Castile and León. In Spain, the variety is known as Doña Blanca (except in Valdeorras, where it is primarily known as Valenciana), while in Portugal it goes mainly by the name Doña Branca. The grapes have thick skins, which do well in the wet maritime climate, but it can also impart some astringency and slight bitterness even with the briefest of skin contact during production due to the high proportion of polyphenols in the skin."
"Borba blanca is a white Spanish wine grape variety grown primarily in the Extremadura region of south central Spain. According to wine expert Jancis Robinson, the grape is of average to low quality and notable mostly for the high productivity and yields of the vine."
"Malvar is a white Spanish wine grape variety that is predominantly grown in the province of Madrid where it is a permitted variety in the Denominación de Origen (DO) of Vinos de Madrid. In the late 20th century there was nearly 2500 ha (6200 acres) of Malvar planted. According to wine expert Jancis Robinson, Malvar produces slightly ""rustic"", medium-bodied wines that tend to exhibit more aroma and flavor than Airén, which is also widely planted in Madrid. Spanish synonyms include Lairén."
"Bosco is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown predominantly in the Liguria region of northwest Italy. It is a permitted variety in the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) wine of Cinque Terre where it is often the primary component of the blend. In winemaking, care must be taken in handling due to Bosco's propensity to oxidize easily, creating potential wine faults."
"Terret gris is a white French wine grape variety planted primarily in the Languedoc wine region. It is a mutation of the ancient Vitis vinifera vine Terret. Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) regulations allow the grape to be used in white wines from the Corbières, Coteaux du Languedoc and Minervois AOCs as well as some vin de pays. The vine has a very long history in the region and is capable of producing full bodied wines with crisp acidity. Terret blanc is the white mutation of the grape. In official statistics, the plantings of two ""light-berried"" Terret grapes (as distinguished from Terret noir, one of the permitted blending grapes for Châteauneuf-du-Pape AOC) are often counted together. The varieties reached their peak in French wine productions in the late 1980s when together the Terret varieties were the ninth most widely planted white grape variety. In the Languedoc, plantings of Terret were equal to that of Chardonnay."
"Forastera is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown on the islands of Ischia and Procida off the coast of Naples in Campania. In the early 21st century, DNA analysis confirmed that the Spanish wine grape variety of the same name grown in the Canary Islands is a completely different and distinct variety with no close genetic relationship to the Italian Forastera."
"Nuragus is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown in Sardinia. It is the principle variety between the Denominazione di origine controllata wine Nuragus di Cagliari. The grape has a long history on the island with ampelographers believing that the variety was likely introduced to the area by the Phoenicians. While the grape is still widely planted in Sardinia its numbers began to dwindle in the late 20th century, falling by 50% during the 1980s alone to a total of 8,700 hectare (21,500 acres) in 1990. Today it is mostly found in the southern part of the island between Cagliari and Oristano on the hot Campidano plain."
Nosiola (or Groppello bianco) is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Trentino region north of Lake Garda in the Valle dei Laghi. Here it is used in varietal Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) wines and as a blending component in wines such as Sorni Bianco from Trento. It is also used to produce a dessert wine in the Vin Santo style from grapes that have been allowed to dry out prior to fermentation.
Merlot blanc is a white French wine grape variety that came from a natural crossing of the Bordeaux wine grape Merlot and the Cognac grape Folle blanche. The grape is distinct from Merlot gris which is a pink-skinned color mutation of the red wine grape Merlot and is sometimes used in vin gris and rosé wines. Plantings of Merlot blanc were first discovered in 1891 but cuttings of the vine have not been widely propagated and the variety is very rare. It is not used to make the sweet White Zinfandel-style wine White Merlot that is made by some California wine producers. Those wines are made from a saignee of red Merlot wine.
"Listán de Huelva is a white wine grape grown mainly in the province of Huelva, in the region of Andalusia, Spain."
"Vernaccia is a white wine grape that is found in many Italian wines but is most commonly associated the Tuscan wine Vernaccia di San Gimignano. Ampelographers have determined that the Vernaccia vine has many clonal varieties but is unrelated to some Italian vines known as ""Vernaccia"" such as the Sardinian varieties used in the Sherry-like wine Vernaccia di Oristano, the Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol red wine grape known as Vernatsch or the black grape used in the red sparkling wine of the Marche Vernaccia di Serrapetrona. A possible reason for this is that the root of the name Vernaccia translates to ""vernacular"" and can apply to any local grape."
"Timorasso is a white Italian wine grape variety grown primarily in the Piedmont wine region of northwest Italy. There it is used to make aromatic wine with some aging potential as well as the pomace brandy specialty of grappa. Timorasso owes its modern-day existence to Walter Massa, as the thick-skinned native variety was almost extinct in the early 1980s in the area of Tortona. Thanks to Massa pioneering efforts, by the late 1990s, other local producers began planting the grape variety themselves and there are now more than 20 firms growing and producing Timorasso."
"The Flame Seedless (Vitis vinifera) is a vigorous, heavy-bearing table grape cultivar that keeps well in storage. It is a hybrid of Thompson Seedless, Cardinal, and several other Vitis vinifera cultivars. It produces large clusters of medium-large red grapes with a sweet flavor. Flame Seedless requires a long growing season. As such, the plants fare poorly in cool, damp zones. However, its good qualities, especially seedlessness, sweetness, and long shelf life, make it one of the most heavily farmed table grapes. The Flame Seedless was brought to the United States by John J. Kovacevich of Arvin, California, in 1973. For a Flame Seedless to be called good-quality, it must be plump, well-colored, and firmly attached to the stem. The grapes are usually picked ripe, as they do not ripen after harvest."
"The Jupiter grape is an interspecific seedless Muscat grape developed at the University of Arkansas in 1998. It is a cross of Arkansas 1258 x Arkansas 1762. The Muscat flavor comes from “Gold” (vitis vinifera) variety; the seedlessness comes from “Reliance” (vitis labrusca) variety. Contains V. labrusca and V. vinifera. This grape variety is patented by the University of Arkansas. Jupiter has large, oval blue-purple berries on large clusters. Its skins are not too tough or too tart to impede its desirability as a table grape. It has mild but pleasant flavor and a pronounced flowery ""Muscat-type"" aromatic profile that carries through in wines made from it. It can be trained to an upright growth habit. The grape has moderate-to-strong resistance to fungal diseases, and can be grown successfully in climates as different as the South and the Pacific Northwest. The variety can attain 21 Brix in sugars and can reach a high yield of approximately 8-13 tons per acre, making it a potentially valuable cash crop. On the negative side, in SW Washington State, it suffers from poor summer drought resistance (on an especially dry, well-drained single site location - perhaps that site is not suitable for commercial viticulture) even with some supplemental irrigation, and from cluster shatter during automated mechanical harvest."
Mureto is a red Portuguese wine grape variety.
"Kabar, also known as Tarcal 10, is a crossing of Hárslevelű and Bouvier and was authorised for production in the Tokaj-Hegyalja region of Hungary in 2006. With a relatively low yield, it ripens early, produces high sugar and is prone to botrytis. Due to its thick skin, it is fairly resistant to late autumn rains."
"Juan García is a rare Spanish red grape variety, hence, the overwhelming majority of Spanish wines are elaborated from the most abundantly grown Spanish variety named Tempranillo, commonly found throughout all regions of Spain. The Juan García grape variety is found only in a remote locale within the province of Zamora and Salamanca, mainly concentrated to the vineyard terraces planted and harvested through the centuries in the terroirs of the small ancient villages once remotely built and enclaved alongside the border of the gargantuan green gorge of the ARRIBES del Duero river canyon. It is an authorized grape variety in the Denominación de Origen of Arribes and the Ribeira Sacra. Juan García is considered a pre-phylloxera autochthonous of the villages that are located bordering the Arribes del Duero river canyon´s passage in north-western Spain. The location is designated as a Natural Park. The Juan García grape variety has medium sized, elliptical berries with dark blue-black skins that grow in compact bunches on short pedicels. Bud break is mostly early, vigor is medium-high, and it is highly productive. The variety shows good resistance to powdery mildew. The elaboration of wine utilizing the rare Juan García grape variety produces a unique taste different with a profound deep burgundy color that is particularly smooth tasting with a long nose."
"Stanušina Crna or Stanušina (Macedonian: Станушина, also rendered as Stanushina) is a red grape variety indigenous to North Macedonia and is found nowhere else in the world. Little known outside of its native country, nonetheless it is capable of producing very high quality wines and is mainly grown in the Tikveš region. The introduction of international grape varieties have caused a sharp decline of Stanušina from the country’s vineyards in recent times, threatening to wipe out this local variety of grape forever. Realizing this, local wineries have begun initiatives to reintroduce this uniquely old Macedonian domestic variety back into the region. The grapevine is highly resistant to drought and pests and can be cultivated without irrigation. The fruit ripens very late but gives good yields, producing on average 15-20 t/ha. The juice obtained contains approx 18-20% sugar and 6-9 g/l acids. During a good year, it can provide a base for wine of high quality and medium strength, with 11-12% of alcohol. Rich in extract but characteristically pale in color, the high level of acid gives the wine excellent freshness and is recommended to be taken at a temperature of 10-16°C. Stanušina typically has a light strawberry, raspberry, blackcurrant and dry leaf aroma. It makes an excellent complement to white and yellow cheeses, light and creamy desserts, leaf salads, nuts and sweets."
"Black Spanish was originally assumed to be a seedling of an American hybrid grape which resulted from a crossing of the American Vitis aestivalis species of grape with an unknown Vitis vinifera pollen donor. However, just recently it has been revealed from microsatellite DNA analysis (a.k.a. Simple Sequence Repeats or SSRs), that the American wild grapevine parent of Black Spanish (a.k.a. Jacquez) is Vitis berlandieri and not Vitis aestivalis. This hybridization is not known to have been purposeful, and may have occurred naturally, as was the case with many of the early American grape cultivars. Riaz et al. (2019) have now published the genetic profile of the Jacquez grapevine as follows (percentages):V. vinifera: 69%V. berlandieri: 21%V. rupestris: 7%V. riparia: 3%. Additional microsatellite DNA analyses conducted on various 'Jacquez cultivars' by Dr Jerry Rodrigues shows that at least two of the European accessions (grapevine collections) which are presently curated in Europe were originally derived from the oldest known Jacquez cultivar (the Madeira Jacquez). The original American hybrid grape parent had found its way to the Madeira Islands sometime in the 18th century (where it was called Jaqué or Jacquet) and thence to France. Lenoir is another such seedling similar to Black Spanish which was grown and used in wine by Nicholas Herbemont of Columbia, South Carolina.Many other historical names appeared throughout the early history of these Jacquez seedlings such as Jack, Blue French, Ohio, and El Paso, among others. For example, Herbemont tells us that he received Lenoir seeds from a man named Lenoir who cultivated it near Stateburg, South Carolina, in the vicinity of the Santee River sometime in the 18th century. Lenoir had made its way to Texas, where it even took on the names El Paso and Black Spanish. From its wild South Carolina parent (likely, V. rupestris), Lenoir (and also Black Spanish) carries natural resistance to the Phylloxera pest, as well as to the deadly Pierce's Disease, which is a common threat to Vitis vinifera vineyards in warm winter areas of the United States. It now appears that Black Spanish inherited its known tolerance to the deadly Pierce's Disease (PD) from its Vitis berlandieri parentage. Lenoir was also one of the American vines which the grape breeder Thomas Volney Munson experimented with in the late 19th century in Denison, Texas. Prior to its use by Munson, Lenoir was grown and used in wine by Nicholas Herbemont, although to a lesser extent than the similar, lighter-skinned variety ""Warren"" (""Brown French"") which become known as Herbemont because of his promotion of that variety. Lenoir was introduced to Europe in the mid-19th century, where French vintners were intrigued by its similarity to European Vitis vinifera winegrapes, and gave it the names Jacquez (or Jacquet). It became an important direct producing grape in Europe during the phylloxera crisis, and later was used to some extent as a rootstock to protect the classic vinifera grapes from phylloxera. Ulysses P. Hedrick's famous ""Grapes of New York"" in 1908 provides the seminal discussion of Lenoir and many of the early North American grapes."
"Tămâioasă Românească (Romanian pronunciation: [təmɨˈjo̯asə romɨˈne̯askə]) (Romanian Muscatel) is a Romanian grape variety used for the production of aromatic wines, Tămâioasă are natural sweet or semi-sweet wines, with alcohol content of 12%-12.5%. In Moldova, is known as Busuioacă albă. The golden-yellow wine has a pronounced honey-like flowery bouquet. Because of its natural sweetness it is usually consumed as a dessert."
"Hondarrabi Zuri is a white variety of Vitis vinifera (Grape) that is native of the Basque Country, Spain. The bunches are small and compact and the berries small, round and golden in colour. The must produces a pale yellow wine, with aromas of citrus fruit, ripe fruit, herbs and flowers. It is the main grape used to make Txakoli wine."
"Jaén tinto, also known as Jaén negro, is a red Spanish-wine grape variety."
"An international variety is a grape variety that is widely planted in most of the major wine producing regions and has widespread appeal and consumer recognition. These are grapes that are highly likely to appear on wine labels as varietal wines and are often considered benchmarks for emerging wine industries. There is some criticism that the popularity of so-called international varieties comes at the price of a region's indigenous varieties. The majority of declared international varieties are French in origin (most notably Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay), though in recent years the popularity of Spanish (such as Tempranillo) and Italian varietals (like Sangiovese and Nebbiolo) has seen an increase in worldwide plantings and these may also be considered ""international varieties""."
"Hondarrabi beltza is a red variety of Vitis vinifera, that is native of the Basque Country, Spain. It is the grape used to make red txacoli wine, which is not as common as the traditional white txacoli."
"Coronation grapes (formally, Sovereign Coronation) are a hybrid variety of table grape developed in Canada. Coronation grapes are popular throughout Canada, and are available during a short period in late summer and early fall. These grapes are characterized by their ""vibrant blue-purple"" colour, similar to the related Concord variety."
"The Almeria grape is a mild-white grape, grown in both the United States and Spain. It is unusual among cultivated grapevines in that it is pistillate, and requires a second grape cultivar to provide pollen, but has remained in cultivation for centuries despite this due to its quality as a table grape."
"Gamay Beaujolais is a varietal designation for a Californian grape variety, an early ripening clone of Pinot noir. It is named after the Gamay grape from Beaujolais."
"Klevener de Heiligenstein, also known in English by its German name, Heiligensteiner Klevener, is a designation used on Alsace wine made from pink-skinned Savagnin rose grapes, a variety in the Traminer family, but which is less aromatic than Gewürztraminer, which is widely planted in Alsace.The designation may be allowed for selected vineyards in the villages Bourgheim, Gertwiller, Goxwiller, Heiligenstein and Obernai but, under current appellation rules, the designation may be used until 2021 for specified existing vineyards outside the designation area.Since Savagnin rose is not a permitted variety for other Alsace wines, its replanting outside this area is not allowed. Since most Alsace wines are varietally labeled, it is a common misunderstanding to believe ""Klevener de Heiligenstein"" to be a local variety. In fact, it is the only geographical designation within the Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) Alsace."
"Blatina (Cyrillic: Блатина) is red wine grape variety primarily grown in the Herzegovina region of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It has a functional female flower (auto-sterile), and for that reason it is always cultivated in plantations with other varieties such as Alicante bouschet (Kambuša), Merlot, and , which at the same time pollinate Blatina. During the period of insemination, because of the rain, it can fail in giving fruits, and it is then called ""praznobačva"" (empty barrel). Blatina can produce dry red wine with 12 to 13.5% of alcohol, 5 to 7 g/l of total acidity, 25-32 g/l of extract. It has a dark ruby red color. Aged in both stainless steel and oak barrels, Blatina will often exhibit aromas and flavors that are spice and coffee-driven. Longer aging will often result in dry chocolate flavors as well. Production is focused in the area south of Mostar around the towns of Čitluk, Međugorje, Ljubuški, and Čapljina."
"Žilavka is a white wine grape variety planted primarily in the Mostar region of Herzegovina, the southern area of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As a varietal wine, Žilavka is known for its bright freshness and acidity. Ideal for general meal pairings, it is often oak aged as a ""barrique"" vintage that present more full bodied and earthy wines with nutty aspects that were more prevalent in the wines produced in the early 2000s and before. Widely planted throughout the former Yugoslavia, Žilavka used to only be a minor blending grape that was used throughout the former country. These days, the wine has come into its own and is bottled as a single varietal alongside the other main grape of Herzegovina wine production, Blatina. Production is generally focused in the area south of Mostar around the villages of Čitluk, Međugorje, Ljubuški, and Čapljina with notable producers such as Nuić, Škegro, Brkić, Vinarija Čitluk, Zadro and Vitai/Gangaš."
"Susac Crni is a native red wine grape in the Kvarner region of Croatia. Typically rare in single bottling, it is often blended with other grapes."
"Malvasia (Italian pronunciation: [malvaˈziːa], also known as Malvazia) is a group of wine grape varieties grown historically in the Mediterranean region, Balearic Islands, Canary Islands and the island of Madeira, but now grown in many of the winemaking regions of the world. In the past, the names Malvasia, Malvazia, and Malmsey have been used interchangeably for Malvasia-based wines; however, in modern oenology, ""Malmsey"" is now used almost exclusively for a sweet variety of Madeira wine made from the Malvasia grape. Grape varieties in this family include Malvasia bianca, Malvasia di Schierano, Malvasia negra, Malvasia nera, Malvasia nera di Brindisi, Malvasia di Candia aromatica, Malvasia odorosissima, and a number of other varieties. Malvasia wines are produced in Italy (including Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Lombardia, Apulia, Sicily, Lipari, Emilia-Romagna, and Sardinia), Slovenia, Croatia (including Istria), Corsica, the Iberian Peninsula, the Canary Islands, the island of Madeira, California, Arizona, New Mexico, Australia and Brazil. These grapes are used to produce white (and more rarely red) table wines, dessert wines, and fortified wines of the same name, or are sometimes used as part of a blend of grapes, such as in Vin Santo."
"Mavro (Greek: μαύρο, meaning ""black"") is an indigenous red grape cultivated on the island of Cyprus. The grape takes its name from its dark colour. The Italian ampelographer, Count Giuseppe di Rovasenda refers to it in 1877 as Cipro Nero (Cyprus black).An ancient variety, its suitability to the hot Cypriot climate has made it the dominant cultivated vine on the island. It accounts for 70% of cultivated vines. Of note is that Mavro continues to grow on ancient rootstock unlike most mainland European grapes that are grafted on North American rootstock. This is a consequence of Cyprus’ escape from the phylloxera epidemic that had devastated most other European vineyards, in the 19th century. Mavrud is a Bulgarian wine with a similar name made from mavrud grapes. Recent genotyping has shown that these two varieties (Mavro and Mavrud) are not related. Mavro grapes are used in the production of several (predominantly red) local wines. Most notably however, Mavro is blended with the Xynisteri grape for the production of Commandaria, a well-known Cypriot dessert wine. It is also used in the production of the spirit zivania. Harvesting usually takes place in September."
"Maratheftiko is an ancient grape variety indigenous to Cyprus. It is also known locally as Vambakadha (Βαμβακάδα), Vambakina (Βαμβακίνα), Pampakia (Παμπακιά), Mavrospourtiko (Μαυροσπούρτικο), Aloupostaphylo (Αλουποστάφυλο).It is grown in sparse quantities around the island but mostly in the Pitsilia region. In the 1980s, with the revival of small boutique wineries in Cyprus this variety was rediscovered and its cultivation is slowly on the increase again, as it offers a distinctive character to local wines. Keo, the largest winery on the island has been one of the companies to encourage its growth. Maratheftiko does not have hermaphrodite flowers like many cultivated grape varieties and requires co-planting with other varieties in order to achieve fertilisation and fruit development. As a result of poor fertilisation, bunches are often greatly affected by Millerandage. 2004 statistics reveal that Maratheftiko cultivation covers 125 hectares which represents less than 1% of cultivated vineyards on the island."
"Xynisteri (also spelled xinisteri; Greek: ξυνιστέρι) is an indigenous white grape grown on Cyprus. According to some estimates, 33% of Cypriot vineyards, on the south slopes of the Troodos mountain range are planted with this grape variety, a fact that makes Xynisteri the main white grape grown of Cyprus. Its clusters and berries are of medium size while it is known for its durability against wine diseases. It is used in the production of several local (mainly white) wines. Xynisteri is blended with Mavro grapes for the production of the Commandaria, a well-known Cypriot dessert wine and it is also used for the production of the local spirit Zivania."
"Jurançon is the name attributed to a red (Jurançon noir) and white (Jurançon blanc) French wine grape variety that is grown predominantly in Southwest France. According to wine expert Jancis Robinson, both colors produce wines of average to low quality."
"Franc Noir de la Haute-Saône is a traditional French variety of red wine grape that is a sibling of Chardonnay. It makes thin, tart wine and has largely disappeared from cultivation."
"Gouais blanc (French pronunciation: ​[ɡu.ɛ blɑ̃]) or Weißer Heunisch (German pronunciation: [ˈvaɪsɐ ˈhɔʏnɪʃ]) is a white grape variety that is seldom grown today but is important as the ancestor of many traditional French and German grape varieties. The name Gouais derives from the old French adjective ‘gou’, a term of derision befitting its traditional status as the grape of the peasants. Likewise, the German name Weißer Heunisch labels it as one of the lesser ""Hunnic"" grapes."
"Mandilaria (Greek: Μαντηλαριά) is a red Greek wine grape variety that is grown throughout the Greek Isles. The grape is often used as a blending component, producing deeply colored wines that are light bodied."
"Kotsifali (Greek: Κοτσιφάλι) is a red Greek wine grape thatis indigenous to the island of Crete. It is mainly grown in the Heraklion regional unit and sporadically on the Cyclades. The grape alone gives moderately red wine with high alcohol content and rich flavor. It is often blended with Mandilaria, yielding aruby-colored dry wine with pleasant taste and aroma that requires minimal aging."
"Liatiko (Greek: Λιάτικο) is an old red Greek wine grape variety that is grown on the island of Crete. While the name suggests a relationship with the Italian variety Aleatico, ampelographers currently discount a connection. Liatiko grapes have a pale red color, are moderate in acidity and rich in aromas and sugars. Liatiko matures in July, a fact that according to one explanation derives its name from Ιουλιάτικο, literally ""of July"" (Ιούλιος in Greek). Historically, the grape has been used in blends with Mandilaria and Kotsifali to produce Malvasia, a very alcoholic, sweet red wine. Malvasia was widely exported by Venetian traders during the Middle Ages and was highly regarded throughout western Europe."
"Romeiko (Greek: Ρωμαίικο or Ρωμέικο) is a red grape variety indigenous to Greece. Its name derives from the term Romios that is used to refer to modern Greeks (literally Roman as a citizen of the former Byzantine Empire). Romeiko is an indigenous grape found on many Cycladic islands and Crete, prominently in the region of Chania and in particular Kissamos where it thrives. Romeiko vineyards are late maturing and high-yielding, producing high-Baumé must that is mixed with other varieties to give red, rosé and white wines. The pomace is distilled to produce Tsikoudia. Kissamos, a red wine with 13% alcohol content, and Clos de Creta, a white wine, are both made from Romeiko grapes. Romeiko is often used to make the traditional wine, similar to a sherry. DNA analysis has shown that the similarly named Marvoromaiko is actually an unrelated variety."
"Assyrtiko or Asyrtiko is a white Greek wine grape indigenous to the island of Santorini. Assyrtiko is widely planted in the arid volcanic-ash-rich soil of Santorini and other Aegean islands, such as Paros. It is also found on other scattered regions of Greece such as Chalkidiki. Assyrtiko is also being grown in Clare Valley, South Australia, and at the Abbey of New Clairvaux in Northern California since 2011. The original Assyrtiko cuttings were imported in the USA in 1948 by Harold Olmo, grape breeder at the University of California, Davis, where they were stored until the abbey of New Clairvaux took interest in the early 2000s. Assyrtiko is also being grown at Kefi Winery in Monroe, North Carolina by a first generation Greek family. On Santorini, many old vine plantations (over 70 years of age) of Assyrtiko exist, of which many are non-grafted. These plantations have shown resistance to Phylloxera. As the only European grape vine known to be resistant to wine blight, there is speculation that the actual source of this resistance may arise from the volcanic ash in which the vines grow, and not from the vine itself."
Vilana (Greek: Βηλάνα) is a white Greek wine grape variety planted primarily in Crete. The grape is a difficult one to cultivate and produces delicate wines rarely seen outside Greece.
"Malagousia or Malagouzia (Greek Μαλαγουζιά) is a white Greek wine grape that was virtually extinct until Professor of Oenology re-discovered it in Nafpaktia and presented it to one of his students, , in the 1970s. Experimental vinification began at the Porto Carras winery, and later continued on 's own estate. The grape is highly aromatic and has the potential to produce soft, elegant wines."
"Moschofilero (Greek Μοσχοφίλερο) is an aromatic white grape of Greek origins with a pink/purple skin and quite spicy flavor with good acidity. Grown throughout much of Greece and primarily in Peloponnese where it is traditionally used to make a dry and bold wine with much spice and perfume. It is characterized by a ""rose garden' bouquet and is usually paired with fresh fruit or fruit-based desserts. It makes still, sparkling, and dessert wines, and can have characteristics similar to the Muscat. It ripens late and can have problems with hot weather. It is the grape required to make the ""Mantineia"" PDO blanc de gris wines. Moschofilero grows in Northern California at the Abbey of New Clairvaux since 2011. The original Moschofilero cuttings were imported in 1948 by Harold Olmo, grape breeder at the University of California, Davis, where they were stored until the abbey of New Clairvaux took interest in the early 2000s."
"Athiri (Greek: Αθήρι) or Athiri Aspro is a white Greek wine grape used to make Retsina on the island of Rhodes. The grape is noted for its lemon character and in other parts of Greece it is often blended with Assyrtiko. In other areas it is blended with Vilana and . Its close association with Rhodes has developed in the use of ""Rhodes"" as a synonym for the grape that can be appear on Greek wine labels."
"Savatiano (or Savvatiano) is a white Greek wine grape used primarily in the wine Retsina. It is one of Greece's most widely planted grape varieties and is known for its resistance to drought condition. It is mostly planted throughout central Greece, particularly in Attica near Athens. In Retsina, the naturally low acidity of the grape is sometimes compensated for by the addition of Assyrtiko and Rhoditis in the blend."
"Robola is a white Greek wine grape variety that is grown primarily on the Ionian island of Cephalonia. Historically the vine was thought to be the same variety as the Friuli wine grape Ribolla and was thought to have been brought to northeast Italy by Venetian merchants trading with Cephalonia in the 13th century. However, DNA profiling in the 21st century has cast doubt on that theory and today Robola is classified by the Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) as a separate variety."
Aidini (also spelled Aidani and Aedani) is a white Greek wine grape variety that is grown primarily on the island of Santorini but it can also be found on other Greek isles in the Aegean Sea. The grape is known for its floral aroma and is used mainly in winemaking as a blending partner with grapes such as Athiri to make dry wines.
Rhoditis (also known as Roditis) is a pink-skinned Greek wine grape traditionally grown in the Peloponnese region of Greece. The grape was highly valued in the Greek wine industry prior to the phylloxera outbreak due to its ability to ripen late and maintain its acidity in hot climates like those of Peloponnese and Thessaly. However its susceptibility to powdery mildew and phylloxera dramatically reduced it plantings throughout the 20th century. Today it is most commonly blended with Savatiano in making the Greek wine Retsina.
"Thrapsathiri (Greek: Θραψαθήρι) is a white Greek wine grape variety that abounds in Crete.The grape is highly resistant to drought, ripens late and produces very aromatic wines with soft acidity.In the past, trapsathiri used to be blended with vilana, but nowadays it is increasingly vinified on its own. Thrapsathiri used to be considered a clone of athiri.However, DNA analysis has suggested that it is a distinct variety with links to vidiano.It has also been suggested that thrapsathiri is identical to begleri of Cyclades."
"Krstač is an ancient variety of grape that is indigenous to Serbia and Montenegro. A high quality dry white wine is made from it. The wine may be rich, of harmonious bouquet and of light yellow color with 12.5% alcohol."
"Prokupac is a red Serbian wine grape that is often used to produce darkly colored rosé. The grape is noted for the high sugar levels it can achieve prior to harvest and the high levels of alcohol it can produce following fermentation. The reasons why Prokupac is widespread grape in Serbia include: 
* resistance to low temperatures 
* not requiring much care 
* giving abundant harvest even on skeletal soil and 
* having high sugar content"
"Tamjanika, Temjanika or Tamyanka (Bulgarian: тамянка, Macedonian: темјаника) is a type of grape, a variety of Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains, grown in Serbia, North Macedonia and Bulgaria. It is named after tamjan (frankincense), due to intense scent from ripe grapes, which can be sensed several metres away. Berries are small, very dark purple, almost perfect balls. It ripens in mid September. Tamjanika is used to produce white wines of intense fruit aroma and taste. It has characteristic Muscat notes of cinnamon, elder plant, basil, pineapple and strawberry. Red Tamjanika is a rarity, but of exceptional quality."
"Smederevka (Cyrillic: Смедеревка) is a white wine grape variety grown in Smederevo, Serbia and in Tikveš wine-growing region of North Macedonia. The variety's name is derived from the name of Serbian city Smederevo. Most probably the growing of this grape variety started during the reign of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius Probus at the site called on the right bank of river Danube near Smederevo."
"Kalecik Karası is a Turkish grape variety and a Turkish wine produced from this grape. This grape and wine are called by the name of area, the Kalecik district of Ankara Province, Turkey. Kalecik Karası grows successfully near Kalecik. In its homeland Kalecik, the microclimate created by Kızılırmak river and the soils rich in marine fossils offer optimum conditions to cultivate good quality Kalecik Karası. Kalecik Karası grapes are known for their taste and aroma. In good vintages, wines made from Kalecik Karası has won several awards in International wine contests, and has attracted the interest of Turkish consumers. As a result, Kalecik Karası has become much in demand among domestic wines in recent years. The Kalecik Karası grape of Central Anatolia, which was on the brink of extinction due to long neglect, has taken its place in viticulture, thanks to the long-term efforts of Turkish and French experts and Ankara University Faculty of Agriculture. Because of high demand, this grape is now also cultivated in other parts of Turkey with similar climatic conditions, such as the high grounds of the Denizli region. A typical Kalecik Karası wine has light to medium bodied, has the color of a ruby red, is rich, well-balanced, and has a lasting aroma of red fruit. It also has vanilla and cacao aromas when it is aged in oak. It has a light, fresh, and elegant finish. Generally, the wine has an alcohol ratio between 12 and 14%, and an acidity range of 4 to 7 grams/liter. It's best when served at 16 to 18 degrees Celsius (61 to 64 degrees Fahrenheit), and is a good match with any kind of red meat, aged cheese, and especially Chateaubriand."
"Çal Karası is a variety of red wine grape from the Çal district of the Denizli Province of western Turkey. It also gives its name to a wine produced from the grape, which is sweet with berry fruit flavours."
"Adakarası (Turkish: adakarası, ""island's black""), is a Turkey origin of red grape variety. Its famous production place is Avşa Island but the grape variety of Adakara produces in all Marmara Region (especially Marmara coast and East Thrace). The wine has an alcohol ratio approximately 12%, and an acidity range of 6 to 7 grams/liter and this wine are also known as Avşa Wine. The Island of Avşa produce 1500 tonnes wine per a year."
"Boğazkere (Kurdish: Şerabî) is a grape variety and a Turkish wine originated from Diyarbakır Province near the Tigris river in the southeastern region of Turkey. It is a dark red rich grape and the wine is well structured with dried fruit and fig flavors. It also gives its name to a wine produced from the grape by the certificated Boğazkere vineyards in Diyarbakır. The characteristics of this wine are strong body, very enjoyable long finish, dark red color with dark blue hue, and rich and strong aromas of dried red fruits and spices. It is good for aging up to 10 years. It is recommended with red meat kebabs, turkey, salmon and cheese, especially eastern Anatolian cheddar or Gruyere cheese."
"Papazkarası, also Papaskara (Turkish: papazkarası, ""priest's black""), is a Turkish grape variety and a Turkish wine grown in the Marmara and Central Anatolia regions of Turkey. This variety was used to make a red wine blend with Cinsaut. The wine has an alcohol ratio between 11 and 13%, and an acidity range of 6 to 8 grams/liter. Papaskarası is also registered in Greece as Kara Papas. It is a very old Thracian varietal and probably the best winegrape cultivar in Turkey. Kirklareli Uskup region is known as the best terroir for Papaskarası. Uskup terroir is based on Strandja decomposed granites, which gives very low yields and small bunches of grapes. In the fertile lowlands, the bunches can be much heavier, at around 500 grams per bunch. Verasion time occurs between mid August and late August at Uskup. The wine can be blended with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Maturity period is very late between mid October and mid November. Total Growing degree-day required is around 1.890 GDD . Papaskarası gives very high acidity to wines. In very ripe years, it can reach to 25 brix levels in the lowland Thracian vineyards of Uzunköprü. Ampelographers believe that Papaskarası is native to the Balkan peninsula and was probably the result of a natural cross between Prokupac and Alba imputotato. Prokupac has been growing in Serbia and Macedonia since at least the 5th century, when it was first mentioned, so the cross between Prokupac and Alba Imputptato would have had to occur sometime after the 5th century. The authors also suggest that Papazkarası is one of the parents of the Kadarka grape."
"Narince is a white wine grape grown in Turkey. It is originated from and grows at Tokat province at mid-southern Anatolia in Turkey. Ripening period is the same as Merlot. Harvest is around mid September. When fully ripe, it has striking amber color. Its parents are Kalecik Karasi and Dimrit both of which Anatolian cultivars. Narince makes usually dry, straw yellow-green color wines with floral notes, sophisticated fruit flavour of yellow fruits of lime, orange, white pineapple, plum, green apple and citrus aromas on the nose. Wines from Narince are medium to full bodied, balanced with good acidity. In cool places, the wines from Narince will have high acidity. It is usually treated with oak.

"Requa is one of the lesser known members of the collection of grape varieties known as Rogers' Hybrids, created by in the mid-19th century, and is the result of a cross of Carter, a selection of Vitis labrusca, and Black Hamburg (there are two varieties known by this name, but in this case it was probably Schiava Grossa), a selection of Vitis vinifera. It was originally known as Rogers No. 28, until Rogers named it after a James Augustus Requa, agent for Thomas Lake Harris' utopian winegrowing community of 'Salem-on-Erie' at Brocton, New York. Requa is female, and thus requires a second grape variety as a pollen source. Fruit is a dark red, ripens late, and is prone to rot."
"Onaka is one of a number of hardy hybrid grape cultivars produced by the prolific breeder Nels Hansen at South Dakota State University. It is a product of a cross of Beta (a hybrid of Vitis labrusca and Vitis riparia known for its cold hardiness) and (a Vitis labrusca x Vitis vinifera hybrid). Although never widely cultivated and today largely forgotten, it has contributed to the cold-climate grape-breeding efforts of breeders such as Elmer Swenson and is a likely parent of his variety Kay Gray."
"Flora is the name of two unrelated varieties of grape, one white and one red, both of United States origin."
"Cabernet Cortis is a dark-skinned grape variety used for wine. It was bred in 1982 by Norbert Becker at the viticultural institute in Freiburg, Germany as part of a programme searching for disease-resistant grape varieties. It received German varietal protection in 2003. From 1999 to 2005, Cabernet Cortis and four other Freiburg-created varieties were evaluated in experimental plantations at Pully in the Lake Geneva region of Switzerland. Cabernet Cortis ripens early, is highly resistant to downy mildew and botrytis, but is sensitive to powdery mildew. Cabernet Cortis yields highly coloured, tannic and intense wines with a herbal-vegetal character that are supposed to be Cabernet-styled."
"Marquette is an inter-species hybrid red wine grape variety. It was developed at the University of Minnesota as part of its grape breeding program (which seeks to develop high quality, cold hardy, and disease resistant wine and table grape cultivars), and is a cross between two other hybrids, MN 1094 and Ravat 262. Marquette was introduced in 2006 and has good resistance to downy mildew, powdery mildew, and black rot, as well as being cold hardy (will survive -37 C when fully dormant). In August 2019, VQA Ontario announced that the province of Ontario's VQA regulations have added Marquette to the list of permitted grape varieties for Ontario wines branded as VQA. The grape is grown in the Thompson Valley, BC region but is not yet on the official BC VQA list."
"Kyoho grapes (巨峰葡萄, Kyohō budō, literally ""giant mountain grapes"") are a Concord-like cross popular in East Asia. The fruits are blackish-purple, or almost black, with large seeds and juicy flesh with high sugar content and mild acidity. The variety was first produced by a Japanese viniculturist, Yasushi Ohinoue in the 1930s and 1940s, by crossing Ishiharawase (itself a variety of the ""Campbell Early"") and Centennial grape varieties (Vitis vinifera × Vitis labrusca). Like the Concord, Kyoho is a slip-skin variety, meaning that the skin is easily separated from the fruit. The seeds are bitter and the skin is not traditionally eaten. The grape maintains some of the flavor qualities of the Concord, known to consumers from the flavor of most grape jellies and Concord grape juice. Kyoho grapes were first produced in 1937 in Shizuoka Prefecture, but were not given their present name until 1946. They are popular in Japan, Taiwan, mainland China, and Korea for their size and very sweet flesh. They are traditionally served peeled as a dessert, and the juice is used in making chūhai cocktails. Areas of production include Nagano Prefecture, Yamanashi Prefecture, California's Central Valley, Changhua County in Taiwan, and Chile. As of 2015, Kyoho was the world's most cultivated grape variety by land area (365000ha). More than 90% of these vines are in China."
"Léon Millot (sometimes called ""Leon Millot Rouge"" (or ""Foster's Leon"") to distinguish it from ""Leon Millot Noir"" (a.k.a. ""Wagner's Leon"") which many breeders believe to be Oberlin 595) is a red variety of hybrid grape used for wine. It was created in 1911 in the Oberlin Institute in Colmar, Alsace, by the French viticulturist (1858–1932) by crossing the hybrid grape Millardet et Grasset 101-14 O.P. (which is Vitis riparia × Vitis rupestris) with Goldriesling, which is Vitis vinifera. The variety was named after the winemaker and tree nursery owner Léon Millot."
"Severny is the name of a Russian red-grape variety. Severny results from the interspecific crossing between and Vitis amurensis. The hybrid has been obtained in the Institute for wineyard researches in Rostov-on-Don in Russia. The variety has been imported to Finger Lakes AVA, just south of Lake Ontario, in the United States. Because of the genes present in Vitis amurensis, the grape is very resistant to frost. Further hybridizations have involved the Severny variety, as with the (with Georgian variety Saperavi) or Cabernet Severny obtentions. It is an important component for the discovery of new grape varieties that can be grown under cold climates."
"Muscat bleu is a red Swiss wine and table grape variety that is a hybrid of and . The grape was developed in in the Canton of Geneva by Swiss grape breeder in the 1930s. Today the grape is used as both a table grape and for winemaking, producing wines that Master of Wine Jancis Robinson describe as ""soft and grapey"". Outside Switzerland some plantings of Muscat bleu can also be found in Belgium."
Chancellor is a hybrid wine grape variety produced by Albert Seibel c. 1860. It is also known as Seibel 7053 and is a cross of Seibel 5163 and Seibel 880. The grape produces a fruity red wine. It is susceptible to both downy and powdery mildew.
"Villard grapes are French wine hybrid grape created by French horticulturist and his father-in-law (father and grandfather of grape breeder Joannes Seyve). They include the dark skin Villard noir and the white-wine variety Villard blanc with both being members of the family. Villard noir is a cross of two other French hybrids, Siebel 6905 (also known as ) and Seibel 7053 (also known as Chancellor) created by physician and plant breeder Albert Seibel. Like Villard noir, Villard blanc was produced as a crossing of two Seibel grapes, in this case, Le Subereux and Seibel 6468. Villard noir was once widely grown in the South West France wine region with some plantings also found in Bordeaux. The variety reaches its peaked in the late 1960s when there was more than 74,000 acres (30,000 hectares) of Villard noir planted throughout France. (And an additional 21,000 hectares of its white skin sibling, Villard blanc). By 1968, Villard noir was the fifth most widely planted black-skin grape in France and Villard blanc the third most widely planted white-skin variety. However, from that peak its numbers soon declined as French authorities attributed the proliferation of hybrid varieties as a cause of the growing wine lake problem in France and ordered the uprooting of many varieties. Since 1977 Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) laws have forbidden the planting of the Villard grapes in France. Despite being a hybrid grape variety, plantings of Villard noir are normally grafted onto Vitis berlandieri rootstock. Although susceptible to botrytis and powdery mildew, the vine is virtually immune to downy mildew and can be found in American wine regions on the east coast where mildew is often a problem. Today, is commonly used as a blending grape for table wine or in the production of distilled beverages."
"Landal noir is a red hybrid grape variety that was created during a series of trials between 1929 and 1942 by French at his Conzieu nursery in the Ain department of eastern France. The grape is a crossing of two Seibel grapes, Plantet and Seibel 8216. While authorized for use in several French wine growing region, the grape is officially not recommended for use in any quality wine production in France with only 49 hectares (120 acres) of the variety reported in 2008. Outside France some plantings of Landal noir can be found in Switzerland, Canada and the United States."
"Seyval noir is a red hybrid grape variety that was created in the late 19th century by French horticulturalist and his father-in-law from a crossing of two Seibel grapes ( and Seibel 5656). The pair used the same two variety to create the white wine grape Seyval blanc making the two siblings rather than color mutations of one or the other. The name Seyval comes from a combination of the two men's names. Unlike Seyval blanc, Seyval noir is not widely planted with only a few producers cultivating the grape in the Canadian wine region of Quebec and some experimental plantings in the Jura wine region of eastern France."
"Landot noir is a red hybrid grape variety that is a crossing of Landal and Villard blanc. Created after a series of trials between 1929-1949, the grape was introduced to Canada and the United States in the 1950s and today can be found in Quebec as well as New Hampshire where a varietal is produced by Jewell Towne Vineyards. In the 1970s, viticulturists at the University of Minnesota crossed Landot noir with a Vitis riparia vine that was growing wild near Jordan, Minnesota to create the hybrid grape variety Frontenac."
"Cascade is a red complex hybrid grape variety that was created by French viticulturist Albert Seibel in the early 20th century in Aubenas, Ardèche, in the Rhône Valley. It has been commercially available in North America since 1938 and has since been planted in Canada and the United States (particularly New York). However, in warmer climates the grape is highly susceptible to a number of grapevine viruses, which has discouraged plantings of the variety."
"Plantet is a red wine grape variety that was one of the hybrid grape created by French physician and grape breeder Albert Seibel. While the exact parentage of the grape is unknown, the most popular theories has it as a cross of two Seibel grapes, Seibel 867 x Seibel 2524 with another theory speculating that Plantet's parentage was Seibel 4461 crossed with . Plantet is grown primarily in the Loire Valley around Anjou and is known for its prolific yields that the vine can produce. The vine is generally reliable and disease resistant, producing well even after suffering through a spring frost, however the berries tend to be difficult to crush which, along with the uprooting of hybrid varieties throughout France, has contributed to the varieties decline in the later half of the 20th century."
"Frontenac is an interspecific hybrid grapevine that is a result of research and cross-breeding by the University of Minnesota. It was grown from a crossing of the complex interspecific hybrid Landot 4511 and a very cold hardy selection of Vitis riparia. It was released in 1996. Frontenac gris is a white wine version of Frontenac, introduced in 2003. It started as a single bud mutation of Frontenac, yielding gray (thus named gris) fruit and amber-colored juice. Frontenac blanc will be introduced in 2012 from white fruited mutations found in both Frontenac and Frontenac gris vines in Minnesota and Canada."
"Thomcord is a seedless table grape variety and a hybrid of the popular Thompson Seedless or Sultanina grape (a Vitis vinifera variety) and Concord grape (a Vitis labrusca variety). Thomcord was developed in 1983 by Californian grape breeders working for the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), as part of a test to better understand a new seedless grape breeding procedure. Its aromatic, ""labrusca"" flavor is similar to that of Concord, but mellowed by the mild, sweet taste from Thompson Seedless. Thomcord grows well in hot, dry climates, ripens between late July and mid-August, and tolerates powdery mildew. It is a productive variety, yielding an average of 15.1 kg (33 lb) of grapes per vine, but has produced as much as 30 to 32 kg (66 to 71 lb) per vine in grower trials. The berries weigh between 2.72 and 3.38 g (0.096 and 0.119 oz) and have a medium-thick, blue-black skin that adheres to the fruit, unlike Concord, which has a thick skin that can slip off the pulp easily. The aborted seeds in the fruit body are relatively small, but larger than those in Thompson Seedless. The plant is not restricted for propagation and distribution. Virus-free propagation material is available from the Foundation Plant Services (FPS) at the University of California, Davis, and its genetic material is archived at the National Plant Germplasm System. After 17 years of testing, it was declared ready for use in 2003. It is currently available in supermarkets."
"Aurore (also known as Seibel 5279) is a white complex hybrid grape variety produced by Albert Seibel and used for wine production mostly in the United States and Canada. Over a long lifetime Seibel produced many complex hybrid crosses (known as Seibel grapes) of Vitis vinifera to American grapes. It is a cross of (which is × ) and (a crossing of Munson and an unidentified Vitis vinifera). The fruit of Aurore ripens early in the season between late August and early September. Although the vine is resistant of many mildew diseases, is productive and vigorous; the fruit suffers susceptibility from bunch rot and bird attack. Aurore is planted where growing seasons are short like the Northern United States, Canada and the United Kingdom but is also planted in more temperate climates to extend the harvest season. Aurore may be used as a table or wine grape. It tends not to be used as a table grape due to unsuitability for shipping and is generally used for bulk wine production for blending with wines made Vitis labrusca grape varieties. It is also used to a lesser extent to make fruity and sparkling wines though the wines tend to have neutral flavor and slight ""foxy"" character typical of many hybrids."
"Phoenix is a white variety of grape of German origin used for wine. It was created by Dr. Gerhardt Alleweldt (1927–2005) at the Geilweilerhof Institute for Grape Breeding in Siebeldingen in 1964, by crossing the Vitis vinifera variety Bacchus with the hybrid grape Villard Blanc. In 2008, there were 48 hectares (120 acres) of Phoenix in Germany, of which 21 hectares (52 acres) in Rheinhessen, 14 hectares (35 acres) in Nahe and 9 hectares (22 acres) in the Palatinate."
"Merzling is a white grape variety used for wine. It was bred in 1960 by Johannes Zimmermann at the viticultural institute in Freiburg, Germany by crossing Seyve-Villard 5276 with the cross Riesling × Pinot gris. The variety was initially known under its breeding code FR 993-60, and was later named after Merzhausen, a location on the southern edge of Freiburg where some of the vineyards of the institute are located. It received varietal protection in 1993."
"Orion is a white wine grape variety of German origin. It was created by Dr. Gerhardt Alleweldt (1927-2005) at the Geilweilerhof Institute for Grape Breeding in Siebeldingen in 1964, by crossing the Vitis vinifera variety Optima with the hybrid grape Villard Blanc. Therefore, Orion is itself a hybrid grape (interspecific crossing) rather than a pure Vitis vinifera. Orion derives its name from the mythological hunter Orion, which gave the constellation Orion its name. It is also known under the synonyms Geilweilerhof GA-58-30 and Gf. GA-58-30."
"Cabernet blanc is a white German and Swiss wine grape variety that is a crossing of the French wine grape Cabernet Sauvignon and an unknown hybrid grape variety. The grape was bred by Swiss grape breeder Valentin Blattner in 1991. Cabernet blanc has strong resistance to most grape disease including botrytis bunch rot, downy and powdery mildew and tends to produce loose clusters of small, thick-skinned grape berries which can hang on the vine late into the harvest season to produce dessert wines. Today the grape is found primarily in the Palatinate wine region of Germany with some experimental plantings in Spain and the Netherlands. In France, in the Languedoc, Domaine La Colombette is heavily investing in PIWI grapes. Amongst others the Cabernet Blanc in their cuvée ""Au Creux du Nid"", is gaining wide acclaim. The grape is currently not being used for commercial wine production in the United States with American wines labeled as Cabernet blanc or White Cabernet instead being sweet pink-colored blush wines made from early pressing of Cabernet Sauvignon grapes similar to how White Zinfandel is produced from the red Zinfandel grape."
"Cassady is a grape variety which is greenish-white in color. It is related to the ""Fox Grape"", Vitis labrusca, and it is an offspring of an open pollination variant of V. labrusca, which means that it is classified as an interspecific crossing, a hybrid grape. It was first described in the Interim Fruit Report of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society in November, 1853. The first Cassady grapevine sprang up as a volunteer (unplanted) seedling in the yard of P.H. Cassady at 29 Logan Square, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1847. It did not bear fruit for five years, but when it finally did, the grapes it produced were found by Cassady to be juicy, pleasantly flavoured, and of very good quality. The Cassady grape was propagated and subsequently crossed with the better-known Concord grape to produce a new white grape variety, the Niagara grape, which is the cultivar most commonly used for the production of white grape juice in North America. The original description of the Cassady grape was published in November 1853 on page 563 of The Magazine of Horticulture, Botany, and All Useful Discoveries and Improvements in Rural Affairs, Vol. XIX, 1853: ART. III. Societies. PENNSYLVANIA HORTICULTURAL. Ad Interim Fruit Report, for November, 1853. — Since the October meeting of the Society, the following fruits have been forwarded to the Fruit Committee for examination : — From P. H. Casaady, 29 Logan Square, two varieties of grapes. 1. The Cassady. — An accidental seedling white grape, with native leaf, and dark purplish wood, that sprung up in Mr. Cassady's yard in 1847, and fruited in 1852 for the first time. Bunch, of medium size, tolerably compact, and sometimes shouldered. Berry, below medium, five-eighths of an inch in diameter ; form round ; color, greenish white with occasionally a faint salmon tint, and thickly covered with white bloom ; flesh, juicy with but little pulp; flavor, pleasant; quality ""very good."""
"Melody is a hybrid white wine grape variety produced from a cross of Seyval blanc and a grape called Geneva White 5, which is itself a cross between Pinot blanc and . Melody produces a light white with notes of peach and honeysuckle, and refreshing acidity, even at low sugar levels (0.7%-0.6% RS). The grape is noted for its resistance to powdery mildew and Botrytis, although downy mildew has been noted on leaves and clusters. It grows well in both sandy and clay loam"
"Breidecker is white variety of grape. It is a hybrid grape, an interspecific crossing (Riesling × Silvaner) × Seibel 7053. It can be used to make a German style light white wine with apple and pear flavors. ""This cultivar was released by the Geisenheim Research Station, Germany, in 1962. Has the technical name GM 4894. It was derived from a Müller-Thurgau cross with the Chancellor (a.k.a. Seibel 7053) hybrid cultivar and can currently be found in limited areas in the South Island of New Zealand, where it is mainly used for producing somewhat neutral varietal and blend white wines. Resistant to bunch rot and downy mildew fungus diseases. Breidecker was named after , one of New Zealand pioneer grape growers."""
"Ravat blanc is a white hybrid grape variety that is a crossing of Chardonnay and a Seibel grape. While the Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) maintained by the Geilweilerhof Institute for Grape Breeding list Seibel 5474 as the second parent, Master of Wine Jancis Robinson notes that other authors list Seibel 8724 as the parent. The grape is often confused with the white hybrid grape Vignoles that is often called just Ravat (or officially Ravat 51). Created in the 1930s by French grape breeder , there were over 600 hectares (1,483 acres) of the grape planted in France in 1958. Today, the grape is more likely to be found in the United States where producers in the Finger Lakes AVA of New York use to it make sweet wines."
"L'Acadie blanc is a white Canadian wine grape variety that is a hybrid crossing of Cascade and Seyve-Villard 14-287. The grape was created in 1953 by grape breeder Ollie A. Bradt in Niagara, Ontario at the Vineland Horticultural Research Station which is now the Vineland Research and Innovation Centre. Today the grape is widely planted in Nova Scotia with some plantings in Quebec and Ontario. Some wine writers, including those at Appellation America, consider L'Acadie blanc as ""Nova Scotia’s equivalent to Chardonnay"". The grape is considered a complex hybrid which means that it has genes from several different species of genus Vitis in its lineage. The full lineage of L'Acadie blanc was mapped out by Helen Fisher of the University of Guelph and revealed that the grape has members from eight different Vitis species including Vitis aestivalis, Vitis berlandieri, Vitis cinerea, Vitis labrusca, Vitis lincecumii, Vitis riparia, Vitis rupestris and Vitis vinifera. In contrast, around 99% of the world's wine is made from grapes belonging only to Vitis vinifera species."
"Rogers' Hybrids are a group of 45 grape seedlings, thirteen of them named as cultivars, developed by Edward Staniford Rogers of Salem, Massachusetts, in the mid-19th century. Although mostly gone from cultivation now, their success, along with that of the Concord grape, inspired many amateurs to try grape breeding, resulting in massive proliferation in the number of grape cultivars in the eastern United States and Canada. Despite this impressive impact, Rogers' hybrids are the product of only two crosses. Rogers pollinated a vine of Vitis labrusca, known locally as Carter or Mammoth Globe, with pollen from two European Vitis vinifera grapes, Black Hamburg and , being cultivated under glass nearby. He planted the resulting seeds in his garden, and the next spring approximately 150 germinated, but cutworms and other pests and accidents reduced their number to forty-five. Numbers one through five, and fifteen through forty-five, were from the cross Carter x Black Hamburg, while numbers six through fourteen were from Carter x White Chasselas. Rogers' garden was only half an acre in the center of the city of Salem, and the grapevines shared it with apples, pears, and currants. As a result, he was unable to test his hybrids on his own. Instead, he numbered each hybrid and sent cuttings to interested fruit growers and horticulturists. A number of them were identified as having fruit quality superior to that of the native vines while being better adapted to North American conditions than the European cultivars. Problems during the dissemination of these vines resulted in confusion of certain selection numbers, and a few hybrids were assigned new numbers, and as a result a few selections bore numbers greater than 45. In 1867, Rogers' named one selection, Rogers' No. 22 or 53, Salem, after his hometown. A few years later, the Lake Shore Grape Growers Association requested that he name several others, and Rogers obliged, naming another twelve selections, primarily after local place names or prominent scientists and writers. The named cultivars are listed below. Only Agawam is currently cultivated to a small extent."
"Massasoit is one of the collection of hybrid grape varieties known as Rogers' Hybrids, created by E.S. Rogers in the mid-19th century, and is the result of a cross of , a selection of Vitis labrusca, and Black Hamburg (there are two varieties known by this name, but in this case it was probably Schiava Grossa), a selection of Vitis vinifera. It was originally known as Rogers No. 3, but 1869 Rogers named it after a prominent Native American chief from early Massachusetts history, Ousamequin, who used the title Massasoit. Massasoit is female, and thus requires a second grape variety as a pollen source for full fruit set. However unlike many female-flowered grapes, if left unpollinated the variety will often set a number of small, seedless grapes, so consistently that the variety circulated for many years under the name Williams Seedless. Fruit is a dark brown-red, and ripens earlier than any of the other Rogers' Hybrids, though considered by many to be inferior to that of the others. Ulysses Prentiss Hedrick, in Grapes of New York, stated that the fruit is at its best before it fully ripens, acquiring an unpleasant degree of foxiness if allowed to hang on the vine too long. Massasoit is rarely, if ever, cultivated today, but it enjoyed some popularity as an early table grape in the late 19th century."
"Herbert is one of the collection of grape varieties known as Rogers' Hybrids, created by E.S. Rogers in the mid-19th century, and is the result of a cross of Carter, a selection of Vitis labrusca, and Black Hamburg (there are two varieties known by this name, but in this case it was probably Schiava Grossa), a selection of Vitis vinifera. It was originally known as Rogers No. 44. Herbert is female, and thus requires a second grape variety as a pollen source. Even then, Herbert tends towards straggly, poorly filled clusters. The black fruit ripens with Concord and keeps well. Although never extensively cultivated, it was a favorite of amateurs in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Hedrick considered the quality, at its best, to rival that of its vinifera parent."
"Goethe is one of the collection of grape varieties known as Rogers' Hybrids, created by E.S. Rogers in the mid-19th century, and is the result of a cross of Carter, a selection of Vitis labrusca, and Black Hamburg (there are two varieties known by this name, but in this case it was probably Schiava Grossa), a selection of Vitis vinifera. It was originally known as Rogers No. 1, until Rogers named it after Johann Wolfgang Goethe, the German author, artist, and scientist. Goethe is female, and thus requires a second grape variety as a pollen source. Fruit is a pale red, ripens late, and is prone to rot. Hedrick considered it the most vinifera-like of the Rogers' Hybrids, but while of high quality, it rarely reaches full maturity in shorter-seasoned climates, and only achieved a measure of popularity in the Mid-Atlantic and Mid-West United States."
"Alexander (also known as Tasker's Grape) is a spontaneous cross of vines from which the first commercial wines in America were made. It was discovered in 1740 in the neighborhood of Springgettsbury, Philadelphia, in a vineyard where James Alexander (d. 1778), Thomas Penn's gardener, had originally planted cuttings of Vitis vinifera in 1683. It was popularized by the Bartram family at Bartram's Garden, Philadelphia, and widely distributed after the American Revolution by William Bartram. The Alexander grape is a hybrid grape of Vitis labrusca and another species, which may probably be Vitis vinifera."
"Agawam (or Rogers 15) is a hybrid grape variety. It is a crossing of (another hybrid grape with Vitis labrusca and Vitis vinifera in its pedigree) and Muscat Hamburg (a Vitis vinifera cultivar). Agawam is one of the so-called Rogers' Hybrids created by E.S. Rogers in the early-to-mid-19th century, and is unique among the named cultivars of that group in that it is self-fertile. It can be used to make a rosé wine having a ""foxy"" flavor."
"Malverina is a grape variety used for making white wine. It was created in former Czechoslovakia by a group called Vine Research Centre Resistant. Malverina is a result of an inter-specific breeding ""Rakish"" (Villard Blanc × Roter Veltliner) × ""Merlan"" (Merlot x Seibel 13666). It exhibits high resistance against both powdery and downy mildew, thus it is suitable for producing wines in limited-spray vineyards. Grapes ripen in mid-October. It is grown in Moravia. High quality wines aged in bottles are full-bodied with distinctive cinnamon aroma and with long persistence."
"Hybrid grapes are grape varieties that are the product of a crossing of two or more Vitis species. This is in contrast to crossings between grape varieties of the same species, typically Vitis vinifera, the European grapevine. Hybrid grapes are also referred to as inter-specific crossings or ""Modern Varieties."" Due to their often excellent tolerance to powdery mildew, other fungal diseases, nematodes, and phylloxera, hybrid varieties have, to some extent, become a renewed focus for European breeding programs. The recently developed varieties, Rondo, and Regent are examples of newer hybrid grape varieties for European viticulturalists. Several North American breeding programs, such as those at Cornell and the University of Minnesota, focus exclusively on hybrid grapes, with active and successful programs, having created hundreds if not thousands of new varieties. Hybrid varieties exhibit a mix of traits from their European, Asiatic, and North American parentage. Those varieties which derive from Vitis labrusca parentage (such as those still used in the production of Austrian Uhudler) have a strong ""candied"" or ""wild strawberry"" aroma, while those that derive from Vitis riparia often have a herbaceous nose with flavours reminiscent of black currants. Most hybrid grape varieties struggle to produce adequate tannin for red wine production, and usually display a level of acidity that exceeds what consumers of wines produced from Vitis vinifera are accustomed to. These attributes proved unpopular in Europe, and were among the factors that led to the prohibition of the commercial growth of hybrid vines in many countries in Europe."
"Nerello is a name given to two varieties of red wine grapes that are grown primarily in Sicily and Sardinia. 
* Nerello Mascalese, which is named after the Mascali area in Catania where the grape is thought to have originated. It is grown mainly on the northeastern side of Sicily and is thought to be superior in quality to the Nerello Cappuccio. While it can be used for blending, the grape is often made into varietal wine. The grape is believed to be an offspring of the Calabrian wine grape Mantonico bianco. 
* Nerello Cappuccio It is widely used in the as a blending grape that adds color and alcohol to the wine. It is one of the three grapes used to make the wine Corvo Rosso. An Italian study published in 2008 using DNA typing showed a close genetic relationship between Sangiovese on the one hand and ten other Italian grape varieties on the other hand, including Nerello. It is therefore likely that Nerello is a crossing of Sangiovese and another, so far unidentified, grape variety. The organoleptic characteristics of the monovarietal Nerello Mascalese generally are a ruby red color, with subtle grenade tones; a strong fruity scent of red berry fruits, with slight floral shades, a spicy hint, and a feeble effusion of vanilla and tobacco, with a persistent trace of licorice; and a dry, tannic, persistent and harmonic taste, with a strong body. At sight, the wine seems surely more mature than it appears when smelled or tasted. Treating this vine variety in a traditional way, it can produce a wine presenting the above-described characteristics."
"Bovale is a name attributed to two Italian wine grape varieties that are known more commonly by their Spanish names. The most widely planted is Bovale Grande (Carignan/Mazuelo) which has larger berries, while Bovale Sardo (Graciano) which has slightly smaller berries and tends to produce a more austere wine is found more rarely. Both are found on the island of Sardinia where they are used mainly for blending."
"Mavrud (Bulgarian: мавруд, from Greek, μαυρό (mavró), ""black"") is a red wine grape that is used as both a blending grape and for varietal wines, indigenous to the Balkan region. It's growing in some regions in Albania, Thrace region in Bulgaria, some regions in Greece and in Rumania. The grape has been described as a characterful, low-yielding, small-berried and late-ripening grape capable of producing tannic, spicy wine with a potential for ageing."
"Cabernet Gernischt is the name given to a red wine grape variety used in China. Originally believed to be of European origin, and similar if not identical to Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Gernischt has since been proven to be genetically identical to Carménère."
"The Swenson Red is a firm, meaty red table grape with a unique fruity flavor with strawberry notes. This was the first grape released from the breeding efforts of Elmer Swenson, and is a favorite among grape breeders and hobbyists. Though it is known as a red, its actual color changes depending on climate. In cooler areas it will be blue, and in very warm areas it will be a translucent green. This is because many pigments inherited from Vitis vinifera only set during relatively cool weather. Swenson Red is one of many successful cold hardy grape crosses involving the parent Minnesota 78. The pollinator parent for the cross is. Swenson Red has a female sibling named ES417 which has very similar characteristics which is a likely candidate for further breeding."
"Cardinal is a table grape variety first produced in California in 1939. The grape is a cross of the Königin der Weingärten and Ribier table grapes, according to latest research. In the United States, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Croatia, France, Italy, Romania, Spain, and Portugal the grape is used as a typical table grape for eating and making raisins. In Thailand and Vietnam it is used widely in wine production. It is the main parent of the Blanc du Bois subtropical wine grape. The cultivation of the variety was introduced in the Philippines in the 1970s where it is mainly grown in the Ilocos region."
"The Red Globe is a variety of very large, seeded red grapes with firm flesh used mainly as a table grape. It can be grown outdoors in very warm areas with long growing seasons such as California, Chile or Australia, but in most of the world it is strictly a greenhouse grape. While seedless table grapes have become the market standard in the United States, in Japan high quality fruit has a very strong demand. For this reason, the majority of Red Globe production in the US and Australia are exported to Asia. Red Globe grapes can be consumed fresh, dried for raisins, and also used for various grape juices. Because of their large size, they can be used as ice cubes in beverages when frozen."
"The Sumoll is a black grape variety. It is a rustic variety, native from the Penedès region in Catalonia (EU), drought resistant and with uniform development. The grape is long and big. It is used to produce red, white, rosé wines and cava (Catalan form of Champagne, the so-called Traditional Method). Its former presence is also evident in the number of different names in Catalan dialects: sumoi, chimoi, saumoll, somoi, sumoy, ximoll, somoll, ximoy, xemoll, among others. The name is related to the local slang term sumollar, which means maturing or withering, from the Latin verb submolliare. Young wine from Sumoll grape has a slight roughness that disappears with aging. Its production is low and treatment for achieving quality wines requires high skills in wine production. Before and after phylloxera, the Sumoll was a variety of black grape widely grown throughout Catalonia. The entrance to the European Union in 1986 accelerated discredit of local varieties, which were not considered able to make good & competitive wines. It has been replaced by other varieties and nowadays its culture is rare, with less than one hundred hectares planted (247 acres). This trend begins to change within the last years. Wine growers are starting to recover and appreciate this variety, as they see an opportunity to create original wines that differentiate themselves by creating their own specialties, gaining a distance from the big industrial companies using only the stocks of international ubiquitous fashionable types - Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot or Chardonnay. The Sumoll is one of the varieties referred by the following DOs (regional certificate of origin authorities), Catalunya, Pla de Bages, Tarragona. In Australia four crossings have been created from Cabernet Sauvignon and Sumoll: Cienna, Vermillion, Rubienne, and Tyrian. The purpose of this crossing is to adapt Sumoll qualities to suit the Australian climate. Using the synonym Vijariego Negro, to which it has been shown to be genetically identical, it is an authorised variety in a number of the Canary Islands DOPs, and the Spanish mainland Pla de Bages DOP. Sumoll Blanc is a white variety that is genetically unrelated."
"Cereza (Spanish for ""cherry"") is a white Argentine wine grape variety. Like Gewürztraminer and Pinot gris, Cereza is a pink skinned variety. It is a crossing of Muscat of Alexandria and Listan negro."
"Schönburger, also spelled Schoenburger, or Schonburger is a variety of grape, formally designated Geisenheim 15-114, a crossing developed at Geisenheim Institute for Grape Breeding in Germany, and released in 1979, of Pinot noir x (Chasselas x Muscat Hamburg). It is grown now in Germany, as well as in England where it is gaining popularity in the early 2000s and is ""authorized"". It can also be found in British Columbia Canada, and in western Washington state, western Oregon state, USA. A common feature of these areas is a cool climate, often maritime influenced.This is a reliable early-ripening grape, though is susceptible to powdery mildew. The wine produced is typically a soft while full and fruity white. Also planted in Tasmania Australia and New Zealand. An early ripening grape very similar to Gewürztraminer. Beautiful eating grape, a vigorous grower."
"Frühroter Veltliner is a variety of early-ripening, red-skinned white wine grape grown primarily in the Weinviertel district of Lower Austria. It accounts for 0.9% of total Austrian vineyards and is diminishing. Frühroter Veltliner is not at all related to Grüner Veltliner, but is a spontaneous cross between Roter Veltliner and Silvaner. It is not particularly demanding of its location and is resistant to both winter and late frosts. However, it ripens very early producing wines of neutral bouquet, high alcohol and somewhat low acidity. It is rarely encountered in the of Germany, in some older vineyards of Alto Adige in Italy, and in the Savoie of France."
"Muscat Rose à Petits Grains is a wine grape for white wine that is a member of the Muscat family of Vitis vinifera. Its name comes from its characteristic small berry size and tight clusters, and from its skin colour. It's a variation of the more common Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains with a pinkish colour. Muscat Rouge à Petits Grains is a further variation with deeper skin colour. It originates from Greece, and is one of three varieties, together with Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains and Muscat Ottonel, allowed for Alsace wine labelled Muscat d'Alsace."
"Siegerrebe (literally ""Victory vine"" in German) is a white wine grape that is grown primarily in Germany with some plantings in England, Vancouver Island, Washington state, British Columbia's North Okanagan and Fraser Valley and Nova Scotia's Annapolis Valley. Siegerrebe was created by German viticulturalist Dr. (1879-1949) in 1929 at a grape-breeding institute in Alzey in Rheinhessen, by crossing Madeleine Angevine and Gewürztraminer. However, Georg Scheu's son Heinz Scheu has claimed in a book that Siegerrebe was the result of self-pollination of Madeleine Angevine. Siegerrebe received varietal protection and was released for general cultivation in Germany in 1958. In 2006, there were 110 hectares (270 acres) of Siegerrebe in Germany with a decreasing trend, in similarity with other ""new breeds"" of white varieties. In Belgium, it is authorised for all still wine AOCs : Côtes de Sambre et Meuse, Hageland, Haspengouw, et Heuvelland."
"Rabo de Ovelha (Portuguese for ""Sheep's tail"") is white Portuguese wine grape variety that is grown all over Portugal. It should not be confused with the red grape variety that is found in the Vinho Verde region. Rabo de Ovelha is an authorized grape variety in the Bairrada, Borba, Bucelas, Redondo, Reguengos, Setúbal and Vidigueira Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC). The grape variety gets its name from the way its grape bunches resembles the end of a ewe's tail. In winemaking, Rabo de Ovelha is known for producing highly alcoholic wines that wine expert Jancis Robinson describes as lacking subtlety."
"Bellone is a white Italian wine grape variety that wine historians believed was cultivated in Roman times. By 1990, nearly 3,000 hectares (7,400 acres) of the variety was still being cultivated and eligible to be blended in the wines of several Latium Denominazione di origine controllatas (DOCs). According to wine expert Jancis Robinson, Bellone produces a juicy white wine. Bellone is the principal white grape in Bianco blends in Cori, Marino, Nettuno, and Roma DOCs and a dozen IGPs. It is also an allowed blending component in more famous Italian white wines such as Frascati (max 30%). It is primarily grown in Lazio and Umbria."
"Montù (or Montuni) is an Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Emilia region of central Italy. While ampelographers believe that the grape is indigenous to the plains of the Po river, its numbers have been steadily declining with 1200 hectares (3000 acres) reported in 1990. There is some confusion about the color of the grapes with the Vitis International Variety Catalogue describing Montù as a blanc grape, while wine expert Jancis Robinson and writers Joe Bastianich and David Lynch describe the grape as a red wine variety. According to Italian wine laws, Montù is a permitted variety in the white Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) wine of Montuni del Reno."
Neyret is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the mountainous Valle d'Aosta wine region of northwest Italy though most plantings are in the slightly less mountainous terrain of southeast Aosta Valley bordering the Piedmont wine region. DNA profiling has confirmed that the variety is a Vitis vinifera crossing of and .
"Terrano (Slovene: Teran) is a Slovenian and Italian wine variety (not to be confused with a completely different grape variety also called Teran, which is indigenous to the Croatian part of the Istrian peninsula), bearing the mark of recognized traditional denomination. It is a member of the Refosco family of grape varieties, which also includes Refosco dal Peduncolo Rosso. Since 2006 it is a wine with a protected designation of origin (PDO) within European Union under the protected designation ""Teran"". Traditional Slovene Kraški teran does not age well—notably, chemical analyses have confirmed that the content of bivalent iron starts to diminish radically two years after fermentation—and should be consumed within its first year; after that, the wine quickly loses its attractive vitality and can even become bitter and flat."
"Barbaroux (also known as Grec rouge) is a pink-skinned French wine grape variety grown in southeastern France. It is a permitted variety in the appellation d'origine contrôlée wine of Cassis in Provence as well as in the Ajaccio region of Corsica. While it is sometimes known under the synonym ""Barbarossa"", DNA profiling has shown the Barbaroux grown in Provence is distinct from the Barbarossa vines grown in Liguria and Piedmont and is likely unrelated to all Italian Barbaross vines. There is also debate among ampelographers about whether the Barbaroux vines in Provence and Corsica are the same grape or separate Vitis vinifera varieties."
"Argant is an ancient variety of red wine grape. It originated in Spain and may have been taken to eastern France by the Romans. It was briefly popular, but little of it remains today. It used to be common in southwestern Germany and in Austria under the name Gänsfüßer (""goose-feet"")."
Aleksandrouli (Georgian: ალექსანდროული) is a Georgian red grape variety.
"Alfrocheiro Preto is a red Portuguese wine grape variety planted primarily in the Dão DOC and Alentejano VR. The grape is known for the deep coloring it can add to wine blends. Under the name Baboso negro, it is considered a minor Spanish red grape variety, growing mainly in the provinces of Zamora and Salamanca, in the region of Castile and León. It is one of the authorized varieties of the La Gomera and El Hierro Denominación de Origen, in the Canary Islands (Spain)."
"Braquet is a red French wine grape variety grown predominantly in the Provence region of southeastern France, particularly in the Bellet Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) where it is as both a blending and varietal grape in still and rosé wines. Also known as Brachet, the vine produces naturally low yields and light bodied wines that are delicately perfumed. Recent thought among ampelographers is that Braquet is not related to the more aromatic Italian wine grape of the Piedmont region known as Brachetto."
"Mondeuse noire (French: [mɔ̃.døz nwaʁ]) is a red French wine grape variety that is grown primarily in the Savoy region of eastern France. The grape can also be found in Argentina, Australia, California, Switzerland and Sicily. Plantings of Mondeuse noire was hit hard during the phylloxera epidemic of the mid to late 19th century which nearly wiped out the vine from eastern France. While the grape recovered slightly in the 20th century, French plantations of Mondeuse noire fell sharply in the 1970s, with just over 200 hectares (490 acres) left in France in 2000. In the early 21st century, it seems the variety has increased somewhat in popularity, as it can give good wines if the planting site is chosen carefully. It was previously suggested that Mondeuse noire was identical to the northern Italian wine grape variety Refosco dal Peduncolo Rosso due to the similarity of the wines. In California, many plantings of Mondeuse noire were called Refosco, further adding to the confusion. DNA analysis has shown that this is not the case, and that the two varieties are unrelated. Mondeuse noire is very similar to Muscardin which is found in Southern Rhône where it is one of the thirteen grape varieties permitted in the wine Châteauneuf-du-Pape. One difference is that Muscardin has less sensitivity to downy mildew. Ampelographers also thought that Mondeuse noire was a color mutation of Mondeuse blanche but DNA evidence has shown that not to be the case with the two varieties having a parent-offspring relationship though it is not yet clear which variety is the parent and which is the offspring. References to Mondeuse usually are to Mondeuse noire rather than to Mondeuse blanche. Mondeuse noire does have a pink-berried color mutant, Mondeuse grise, which was on the verge of extinction until ampelographer Pierre Galet was able to identify vines and have cuttings planted at the Domaine de Vassal conservation vineyard in Montpellier run by the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA). In Savoie, Mondeuse noire is used in blending with Gamay, Pinot noir and Poulsard where it contributes its dark color and high acid levels to the wine that allow the wines to age well. The grape is a permitted variety in the Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) wines of Bugey in the Ain department and Vin de Savoie."
"Domina is a dark-skinned variety of grape used for red wine. It was created by Germanviticulturalist at the Geilweilerhof Institute for Grape Breeding in the Palatinate in 1927 by crossing the varieties Blauer Portugieser and Pinot noir (known in Germany as Spätburgunder). Work on the variety was the continued by Bernhard Husfeld at the same institute in the 1950s. The variety received protection and was released for general cultivation in 1974. In 2006, there were 395 hectares (980 acres) of Domina in Germany, with an increasing trend. Domina plantings are primarily found in Franconia. Domina wines are dark red and rich in tannin. In Belgium, it is authorised for AOCs : Hageland and Haspengouw. Domina gives high yields and is not very demanding with respect to vineyard conditions. It ripens later than its parent Blauer Portugieser but earlier than its parent Pinot noir. Domina wines are full-bodied and have a deep colour, but are not considered as elegant as German-grown Spätburgunder."
"Aubun is a red wine grape grown primarily in the Rhône valley. The grape has similar characteristics to Carignan grapes in that it tends to produce high yields and produces wines that are fat with slight bitter finishes. Early during the phylloxera epidemic of the 19th century, the Aubun vines showed some resistance to the pest as well as to downy and powdery mildew. The vines tends to bud late and not be affected by spring frost. In 2000, there were 1,400 hectares (3,500 acres) of Aubun in France."
"Trousseau or Trousseau Noir, also known as Bastardo and Merenzao, is an old variety of red wine grape originating in eastern France. It is grown in small amounts in many parts of Western Europe; the largest plantations are today found in Portugal, where most famously it is used in port wine. It makes deep cherry red wines with high alcohol and high, sour candy acidity, and flavours of red berry fruits, often complemented - depending on production - by a jerky nose and an organic, mossy minerality."
"Limnio (LIM-nee-oh) is a red Greek wine grape variety that is indigenous to the Greek island of Lemnos. The grape has had a long history of wine production that may extend back to Ancient Greece with wine historians widely believing it was the grape variety, Lemnia, that was described by Aristotle as producing the famous red Lemnian wine. According to wine expert Oz Clarke, Limnio is ""One of Greece's most important red vines."""
"Ancellotta is a wine grape variety mainly grown in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy, but also in some other parts of north Italy, and in south Switzerland."
Calabrese Montenuovo is an ancient variety of red wine grape from Italy. It was discovered in a vineyard in Campania and became famous when it was found to be one of the parents of Sangiovese.
"Parraleta is a red Spanish wine grape variety which might also be known under various other names, such as Tinta Caiada (Alentejo, Portugal) in several Mediterranean countries. Parraleta is chosen as a prime name as it (old synonym Parrel) was used in Somontano, region located in the north-east Spain, which is its likely place of origin. DNA profiles of Tinta Caiada (Alentejo, Portugal), and Carenisca (Sardinia, Italy), and Salceño Negro (Somontano, Spain) with that of Parraleta suggests that they are one and the same variety."
"Magarach Ruby or Rubinovyi Magarcha is a red Crimean wine grape variety that is a crossing of Cabernet Sauvignon and Saperavi. The crossing was carried out at the Magarach viticultural institute at Yalta, Crimea in 1928 in what was then the Soviet Union."
"Bondola is a wine grape variety grown in the northern part of Ticino, Switzerland. It is mainly used in traditional wines, mainly by small or family wineries, and thus not very widespread in shops and restaurants."
"Baga is a red Portuguese wine grape variety planted primarily in the Bairrada DOC. As a varietal, Baga produces tannic wines with high acidity."
"Bachet noir is a traditional French variety of red wine grape that is a sibling of Chardonnay. A little is still grown in the Aube, where it is used to add colour and body to Gamay wines."
Beaunoir is a traditional French variety of red wine grape that is a sibling of Chardonnay. The 'beautiful black' grape produces a thin wine and not much is grown these days.
"Cabernet Mitos is a dark-skinned variety of grape used for red wine. It was created at a grape breeding institute in Weinsberg in the Württemberg wine region, Germany in 1970 by crossing Blaufränkisch and Teinturier du Cher.The previous belief that it was a cross between Blaufränkisch and Cabernet Sauvignon, which even the breeders themselves stated, was corrected in 2013 through a DNA analysis.""Mitos"" is the German word for mitosis, a stage in the cell cycle. Cabernet Mitos received varietal protection and was released for general cultivation on January 24, 2001. The vines of Cabernet Mitos show good winter hardiness. In 2006, there were 317 hectares (780 acres) of Cabernet Mitos in Germany, with an increasing trend. Cabernet Mitos wines are full bodied and rich in tannin, and are well suited for oak barrel aging. The wines show similarities in aromas to Cabernet Sauvignon."
Aspiran (or Aspiran noir) is a red French wine grape variety planted primarily in the Languedoc where it permitted under Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) regulations in the red and rosé wines of the Minervois AOC. Aspiran is a very old variety with a long history of producing light bodied and perfumed wines.
"Colorino is a red Italian wine grape variety planted primarily in Tuscany. The grape is known for its deep dark colouring and is used primarily as a colouring agent in red blends. In the history of Chianti it played a minor role, mostly for its affinity and use to the governo winemaking technique. Like Canaiolo, Colorino did not rot easily while going through the partial drying process to later be added to the fermenting grape must. However the grape did not provide the same level of fruit and softening effect that Canaiolo did and fell out of favour. In the late 1980s, there was a surge of interest in the variety among Tuscan winemakers who saw in this local grape variety similarity to the role Petit Verdot plays in Bordeaux blends. Colorino was planted and used to add darker colours and structure from phenolic compounds in the grape's thick skin without the overpowering aromatics that Cabernet Sauvignon could add. This enthusiasm was short lived and by the turn of the 21st century Colorino returned once again to a minor role in Tuscan wines."
"Frappato di Vittoria or Frappato is a red Italian wine grape variety planted primarily in Sicily. As a varietal, Frappato produces light bodied wines with a distinct grapey aroma. It is most commonly seen as a component of Sicily's only DOCG wine, Cerasuolo di Vittoria, which consists of 30-50% Frappato and 50-70% Nero d'Avola. An Italian study published in 2008 using DNA typing showed a close genetic relationship between Sangiovese on the one hand and ten other Italian grape varieties on the other hand, including Frappato. It is therefore likely that Frappato is a crossing of Sangiovese and another, so far unidentified, grape variety."
"Dureza is a dark-skinned French wine grape variety from the Ardèche department of south central France in the Rhône-Alpes region. The grape is most widely known for being the father vine of Syrah—a discovery that confirmed that the Syrah vine was native to France and not introduced to the country from Persia, Sicily, Egypt or elsewhere, as had been speculated. Dureza was historically used for production of red wine, but is hardly grown any more and is not part of the list of the allowed grape varieties of any French Appellation d'origine contrôlée wine, though it can be produced under some vin de pays. There were only 11 hectares planted to Dureza in the late 1970s: by 1988 only one hectare remained. However, since the variety's relationship to Syrah was revealed, interest in Dureza has been increasing: has introduced plantings of the grape to the Saint-Joseph AOC in the northern Rhône Valley, for wine to be made under the appellation of Collines Rhodaniennes vin de pays."
"Helfensteiner is a dark-skinned German wine grape crossing of the species Vitis vinifera, that was created in 1931 with the crossing of Frühburgunder (Pinot Précoce noir) and Trollinger (Schiava Grossa). It was created by August Herold at the grape breeding institute in Weinsberg in the Württemberg region. The name of the variety is derived from that of the castle ruin Helfenstein close to Geislingen an der Steige. A relatively small amount of Helfensteiner is cultivated in Württemberg, 19 hectares (47 acres) in 2008 (and less than 1 ha in the rest of Germany combined). It produces red wines of a fruity character, and rosé wines. The reason for the variety's limited popularity with growers is its very variable yield, which is due to its susceptibility to flowering problems. Helfensteiner was later, in 1955, crossed by Herold with Heroldrebe to produce the much more successful Dornfelder. The variety shares the same parentage as Dornfelder."
"Heroldrebe is a red German wine grape variety produced by crossing Blauer Portugieser and Lemberger. It was created by August Herold at the grape breeding institute in Weinsberg in the Württemberg region in 1929, and was named after him. One of Heroldrebe's drawbacks is its relatively late ripening; it is harvested at about the same time as Pinot noir. Heroldrebe was grown on a total of 155 hectares (380 acres) in Germany in 2008, with a decreasing trend. There were 99 hectares (240 acres) in Palatinate, 32 hectares (79 acres) in Rheinhessen, and 23 hectares (57 acres) in Württemberg. In Palatinate it is typically used to produce light, almost pinkish, colored wines."
"Moreto is a red Portuguese wine grape variety that is planted primarily in the Alentejo. As a varietal, the grape makes neutral wines."
"Portan is a red French wine grape that is planted primarily in the Languedoc. The grape is a crossing of Grenache and Portugais, being breed with the aim of ripening more reliably than Grenache."
"Caladoc is a red French wine grape variety planted primarily in the southern wine regions such as the Languedoc. The grape is a crossing of Grenache and Malbec created by in 1958 at Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA). While the grape is used in several vin de pays in the Languedoc and Provence wine regions, it is not officially permitted in any Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) wines. On 15-Nov-2017 France’s National Institute of Origin and Quality (L'Institut national de l'origine et de la qualité - INAO) approved experimentation with Caladoc in the specifications of the Côtes du Rhône AOC for the production of red and rosé wines."
"Counoise is a dark-skinned wine grape grown primarily in the Rhône valley region of France. Counoise is also grown in California and Washington. Counoise adds a peppery note and good acidity to a blended red wine, but does not have much depth of colour or tannin. There were 638 hectares (1,580 acres) of Counoise in France in 2000. Counoise is one of the grapes allowed into the blend of Châteauneuf-du-Pape wine. In 2004 only 0.5% of the appellation's area was planted with Counoise. Some producers who favour the variety use about 5% of it in their blends, and those account for most of the plantings. One such producer is Château de Beaucastel, which is noted for using all the 13 allowed varieties."
"Mammolo is a red Italian wine grape that is planted primarily in Tuscany. While its use has been diminishing, Mammolo was historically included in the blended Sangiovese-based wines of Chianti where it contributed a distinctive violet or mammole aroma. In addition to small plantings in the Chianti zone, Mammolo can be found in the Vino Nobile di Montepulciano region of Tuscany and in scattered vineyards throughout Central Italy."
Marufo or Mourisco tinto is a red Portuguese wine grape that is planted primarily in the Douro DOC. It is a recommended grape in Port wine production.
"Piedirosso is a red Italian wine grape variety that is planted primarily in the Campania region. The grape is considered a specialty of the region, being used to produce wines for local and tourist consumption. Its name ""piedirosso"" means ""red feet"" that reflects the bottom of the vine which used to be red similar to the red feet of a pigeon. The grape is believed to be one of the parent varieties of the central Italy grape Abbuoto, possibly a crossing with . DNA analysis has also shown a close genetic relationship between Piedirosso and the white Campanian wine grape Caprettone that was previously thought to be a clone of Coda di Volpe."
"Tazzelenghe is a red Italian wine grape variety from the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region of northeast Italy. The grape is predominantly found in the Colli Orientali del Friuli Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC). The grape's name means ""Tongue stinging"" or ""Tongue cutting""."
Susumaniello is a variety of red wine grape from the 'heel' of Italy. It is an ancient grape variety which is grown in the province of Brindisi in the southern Italian region of Apulia.
"Brachetto is a red Italian wine grape variety grown predominantly in the Piedmont region of northwest Italy. At one time the grape was thought to be related to the French wine grape Braquet, but recent thought among ampelographers is that the two are distinct varieties. In Italy's region of Piedmont the grape is somewhat more widespread: production mostly falling within an area of the provinces of Asti and Alessandria between the rivers Bormida and Belbo plus various parts of the province of Cuneo. At Canelli, on the border between the hills of Asti and the Langhe proper, the grape is known as Borgogna. The most notable wine here is the red Brachetto d'Acqui Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) which is made in both still and spumante (fully sparkling) versions. The Piemonte Brachetto Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC), also a red wine, is made with a minimum of 85% Brachetto; it is usually still, but may be frizzante (lightly sparkling). The grape is also used for up to 10% of the blend for the Ruché-based Ruché di Castagnole Monferrato DOC."
"Manto negro is a red Spanish wine grape variety grown on the Balearic islands. It is used in wines produced under the Binissalem-Mallorca and Plà i Llevant (DO) Denominación de Origen (DO)s, as well as the Illes Balears appellations. Today, Manto negro is almost exclusively found on the island of Majorca with 320 hectares (790 acres), making it the most widely planted grape variety on the island. It represents over 20% of the total vineyard land in production. Although planted throughout the island, the vine seems to be more successful in the rocky soils of the western Binissalem region."
"Ives noir is a red hybrid grape variety that is grown throughout the United States. Named after its propagator, Connecticut wine grower Henry Ives, the grape's pedigree and exact origin are unclear. After Prohibition in the United States, Ives was a popular grape used in the production of sweet port-style wines but saw its plantings steadily decrease throughout the 20th century as the vine's susceptibility to air pollution took its toll."
"Triomphe d'Alsace is a black grape variety of Franco-German origin, commonly grown in the United Kingdom."
"Royalty (also known as Royalty 1390) is a rouge Californian wine grape variety that was developed in 1938 by Dr. Harold P. Olmo of the University of California, Davis. The grape is a red fleshed teinturier which, unlike most red wine grapes, will produced red-tinged colored wine even without maceration time on the skins. The grape is a hybrid being produced from the Vitis vinifera Trousseau gris variety from the Jura wine region of France and the teinturier grape Alicante Ganzin that, itself, is a hybrid of a Vitis rupestris variety and the Vitis vinifera grape Aramon."
Rosette or Seibel 1000 is a wine hybrid grape red-berries variety which originated with the work of Albert Seibel by a crossing of Jaeger 70 with Vitis vinifera. Rosette is also the common ancestor of St. Pepin and La Crosse grapes. Rosette is used to produce rosé wine.
"Criolla Grande (also known as Criolla and Criolla Grande Sanjuanina) is a red wine grape commonly found in Argentina. It is different from the Chilean wine grape Pais, also known as Criolla Chica, but ampelographers believe that both grapes share a common parent, and it is now listed as a crossing of Mission and Muscat of Alexandria. As of 2006, Criolla was the third most widely planted Argentine wine grape (22,500 hectares) after Cereza (30,000 hectares) and the more widely exported Malbec (24,400 hectares). It is primarily found in the Mendoza region. The grape has pink skin, which is thicker than in its Chilean cousin, Pais, and is used to produce deeply colored white wine. It is sometimes used to produce a light colored rosé. The grape is rarely exported outside of Argentina where it is used to produce massive quantities of box and jug wines."
"St. Laurent (sometimes written in French as Saint Laurent or in German as Sankt Laurent) is a highly aromatic dark-skinned wine grape variety. Its origins shrouded in mystery, St. Laurent is believed to have resulted from a crossing of Pinot noir with an unknown second parent. St. Laurent is the most widely planted red grape variety in the Czechia, growing in all wine subregions in both Moravia and Bohemia. It comprises approximately 9% of total vineyards, or 1,730 hectares (4,300 acres). In Austria, St. Laurent is the third most popular red grape variety and is primarily grown in Lower Austria and Burgenland. In 2008, Austrian plantations stood at 794 hectares (1,960 acres), and have expanded in the 2000s as a part of general red wine trend in Austria, after having declined somewhat during the 1990s."
"Shiroka Melnishka, (Bulgarian: Широка мелнишка лоза / Šhiroka Melnišhka loza), often called Melnik (Мелник, distinct from other varieties named after the town) or Broadleafed Melnik, is a red Bulgarian wine grape variety. It is planted primarily near the Greek border. In Bulgarian the grape's name means ""broad-leaved vine of Melnik"". As a varietal, Shiroka Melnishka has an affinity for oak which can produce pronounced tobacco notes. The wines are often compared to Châteauneuf-du-Pape with its similar profile of spice and power. The wine was a particular favourite of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Notable producers of wine from the variety are Abdyika Vineyard, Villa Melnik, Damianitza, Logodaj and Sintica wineries."
"Marselan is a red French wine grape variety that is a cross between Cabernet Sauvignon and Grenache. It was first bred in 1961 by near the French town of Marseillan. The vine is grown mostly in the Languedoc wine region with some plantings in the Northern Coast of California. It has also become very popular in China. The grape usually produces a medium body red wine. Along with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, Marselan is one of the grapes planted in the , a collaboration project between the Chinese and French government intended to generate interest in grape winemaking in China by demonstrating French grapes and winemaking techniques."
"Mujuretuli is a red wine grape grown in Georgia. It is also known as Mudzhuretuli, Mudshuretuli and Keduretuli."
Alvarelhão is a red wine grape grown in northern Portugal.
"Roesler is a red Austrian wine grape developed in 1970 by Dr. Gertraud Mayer at , Austria. It is the result of a crossing Zweigelt x (Seyve-Villard 18-402 x Blaufränkisch) and is named after the former director of Austria's oldest viticultural college, Leonard Roesler. The variety is deep in color and with abundant extract. It is frost resistant and can withstand temperatures as low as -25ºC (-13ºF). It is also resistant to mildew."
"Azal Tinto or Amaral is a variety of red Portuguese wine grape. It is planted in the Minho region where it is used in red Vinho Verde, while the related Azal Branco is used for white Vinho Verde."
"Douce noir (also known as Bonarda, Corbeau and Charbono) is a red Savoyard wine grape variety that has historically been grown in the Savoy region, but today is more widely planted in Argentina. The earliest mention of the grape dates from when Etruscans first planted Bonarda some 3.000 years ago in the Padana Region. It arrived in Savoie in the early 19th century, and by the end of the century it was the most widely grown red wine grape in the region. In the early 21st century it was discovered that the Bonarda grape, which is the 2nd most widely planted red grape, after Malbec, in Argentina was the Italian wine grape Bonarda Piemontese imported by Italian immigrants. The grape is also grown in California where it is known as Charbono. In California, Bonarda/Douce noir/Charbono is produced in very limited amounts with the grape having been described as a ""cult wine"" for its scarcity and devotion of its connoisseurs. However, journalists such as Alan Goldfarb describes the variety as ""... the Rodney Dangerfield of wine"" and notes that it is a hard variety to find a market for."
"Grolleau or Grolleau noir is a red French wine grape variety that is grown primarily in the Loire Valley of France. The name is derived from the French word grolle, meaning ""crow"" and is said to reflect the deep black berries of the Grolleau vine. The grape is most commonly made into rosé wine, particularly in the Anjou region. Grolleau wines tend to low alcohol content and relatively high acidity."
"Alicante Ganzin is a red French wine grape variety. Unlike most Vitis vinifera wine grapes, Alicante Ganzin is a teinturier with dark flesh that produces red juice. Most varieties used to produce red wine, such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, etc., have clear color flesh and juice with the wine receiving its color through a maceration process where the color seeps out of the grape skins for as long as they are in contact with the juice. Alicante Ganzin can thus produce light red and rose colored wine without maceration. It is believed that Alicante Ganzin is often described as the progenitor of all French teinturier grapes."
"Rotberger is a wine grape variety. Its parentage is not known with certainty but it is thought to be from a cross of Trollinger and Riesling grapes. Dr. Heinrich Birk (1898-1973) produced the cross at the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute in 1928. It is used to produce fruity, early maturing light red wines in cool-climate areas. It is often best drunk when young and can be used to produce a rosé or sparkling wine. It has no relationship with the Rotburger variety bearing a nearly similar name which is also known as Zweigelt. Production of rotberger is quite small and primarily limited to Austria, Canada, Germany, and Liechtenstein."
"Caíño tinto (also known as Borraçal in Portuguese) is a red Galician wine grape variety that is also grown in Portugal's Vinho Verde wine region where it is known as Borraçal. In Spain, it is a permitted variety in the Denominación de Origens (DOs) of Rías Baixas and Ribeiro where it produces highly perfumed wines with noticeable tartness and high acidity."
"Castelão, in Portugal also known as Periquita and João de Santarém, is a red wine grape found primarily in the south coastal regions but is grown all over Portugal and is sometimes used in Port wine production. The name is derived from the Portuguese term for parakeet. The vine thrives in sandy soils but is able to adapt to a variety of conditions. It produces a wine that can be harshly tannic in its youth but softens as it ages. In the Algarve VR, it is often blended with Negra Mole to produce a wine with less aging potential but less harsh in its youth."
"Cornalin d'Aoste or Humagne Rouge is a variety of red wine grape. It was named after the Aosta Valley in northwestern Italy where it was wrongly presumed to have originated, but where it is now almost extinct. It is primarily grown in the Valais region in Switzerland, where it is called Humagne Rouge, and the total Swiss plantations of the variety in 2009 stood at 128 hectares (320 acres). The wines produced from the variety are wild, rustic and high in tannin. That Cornalin d'Aoste and Humagne Rouge are in fact the same variety was established by DNA profiling at Changins in Switzerland and Aosta in Italy. At the same time, it was established that it is not related to the white variety Humagne Blanche. Researchers at UC Davis later established that Cornalin d'Aoste is an offspring of Rouge du Pays, also known as Cornalin du Valais."
"Béquignol noir (also known as Red Chenin) is a red French wine grape variety that originated in Southwest France but is now more widely grown in the Mendoza wine region of Argentina where it is often used to add color to blends. The grape is often confused with several other red wine varieties such as Cabernet Franc, Durif, Fer and with Béquignol noir sharing several synonyms with these grapes. However DNA profiling has shown Béquignol noir to be distinct from those grape varieties. Further research in 2011 showed that Béquignol noir may have a parent-offspring relationship with the Savagnin grape."
"Ramisco is a red Portuguese wine grape variety that is planted primarily in the Colares DOC. As a varietal, Ramisco produces very tannic and astringent wines."
"Manseng noir (sometimes translated: Black Manseng) is a wine grape variety of Basque origins that is grown primarily in South West France. It is allowed into Béarn AOC wine but very little used. Manseng Noir is deep in colour and tannic. Like Pinot noir and Muscat, the grape mutates easily and has spawn several additional grape varieties that are more commonly used in wine production, most notably Petit Manseng and Gros Manseng."
"Tinta Cão is a red Portuguese wine grape variety that has been grown primarily in the Douro region since the sixteenth century. The vine produces very low yields which has led it close to extinction despite the high quality of wine that it can produce. Improvements in bilateral cordon training and experiments at University of California, Davis have helped to sustain the variety. The vine favors cooler climates and can add finesse and complexity to a wine blend."
"Rouge du Pays, also known as Cornalin du Valais or Cornalin, is a variety of red wine grape. It is primarily grown in the Valais region in Switzerland, where it is often called Cornalin, and the total Swiss plantations of the variety in 2009 stood at 116 hectares (290 acres). It produces deep-coloured wines that typically need aging, and is something of a speciality of Valais. Cultivating Rouge du Pays requires a fairly warm climate, and the viticultural research institute at Changins has been involved in finding out how its yields can be made more regular than was previously the case. DNA profiling at UC Davis has established that Rouge du Pays is a cross of Petit Rouge and , two varieties from the Aosta Valley in northwestern Italy, close to Valais. Furthermore, Cornalin d'Aoste was established as an offspring of Rouge du Pays."
Pollera nera is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown primarily in the Liguria wine region and northwest Tuscany. Ampelographers believe that the vine has a very long winemaking history but it is rarely seen today. It is believed to have been descended from the Chianti wine grape Mammolo and the Corsican wine grape Sciacarello which would make it a half-sibling of Colombana nera.
"Servanin is a red French wine grape variety grown predominantly in the Isère department in eastern France. While the variety has a long history in the region, plantings have been steadily declining since the early 20th century with the vine now close to extinction. In the 20th century, ampelographers and (decades later) Linda Bisson categorized Servanin as a member of the Pelorsien eco-geogroup along with Bia blanc, , Dureza, , Durif, Jacquère, Mondeuse blanche, Peloursin, Joubertin and Verdesse."
"Grand Noir de la Calmette (or simply Grand noir) is a red teinturier grape variety that is a crossing of Petit Bouschet and Aramon noir created in 1855 by French grape breeder Henri Bouschet at his vineyard in Mauguio in the Hérault department. The grape was named after the breeding station Domaine de la Calmette. As a teinturier, Grand noir is often used to add color to wines that it is blended into but is paler than other choices such as Alicante Bouschet. The vine tends to bud late and has a high productivity but with some susceptibility to the viticultural hazard of powdery mildew. While Grand Noir de la Calmette originated in France and was once widely grown in the Cognac and Languedoc wine regions, today it is rarely planted in that country. Instead, the variety is predominately found in the Spanish wine regions of Galicia in northwest Spain and in the southern Portuguese wine regions of Alentejo. Grand Noir de la Calmette is often compared with its sibling grape, Alicante Bouschet, and the wines that both varieties produce tend to be very similar though Master of Wine Jancis Robinson notes that those made from Grand Noir de la Calmette tend to have more noticeable ""peppery"" spice."
"Mauzac noir is a red French wine grape variety that is grown in Southwest France. Despite the similarities in name, Mauzac noir is not a color mutation of the white Limoux wine grape Mauzac that is an important component in the Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) sparkling wine Blanquette de Limoux. Today Mauzac noir is nearly extinct but at least one grower in the Gaillac AOC is attempting to revive the variety and make varietal examples of the grape."
"Madrasa (Azerbaijani: Mədrəsə, also known as Matrassa and Madrasi) is a pink-skinned red grape variety cultivated in the southern Caucasus at least since the nineteenth century, in particular in Azerbaijan and Armenia, as well as several Central Asia countries. Most plantings of Madrasa are found near the Caspian Sea in Azerbaijan and Armenia."
"Pinot Noir Précoce or, as it is called in parts of Germany, Frühburgunder is a dark, blue-black–skinned, variety of grape used for wine and is a form or mutation of Pinot noir, which differs essentially by ripening earlier than normal (thus the use of the descriptive nomination 'précoce'). Whilst sometimes treated as a separate grape variety by ampelographers, there are nevertheless those who consider it is simply an early ripening form of Pinot Noir, and in some cases, Pinot Noir Précoce wines may therefore be found straightforwardly labelled ""Pinot noir"". As it seems highly likely that Pinot Noir Précoce is simply a natural early ripening mutation of Pinot noir, it is extremely likely to have occurred and been selected and specially cultivated in many different Pinot growing regions (e.g., Burgundy, Champagne, Alsace, Loire, and throughout many older German vineyards) on many separate occasions throughout the long history of Pinot noir cultivation in Europe. Wines from Pinot Noir Précoce are closely similar to, if not indistinguishable from, those of Pinot noir, and it is far from clear that anything distinguishes its wines other than oenological characters resulting from its early ripening (e.g., relatively fuller flavor development, lower acidity, and the like)."
"Ségalin is a red French wine grape variety that is a crossing of Jurançon noir and Portugais. As a varietal, Ségalin has the potential to produce well structured wines. Ségalin has no synonyms."
"Calitor or Calitor noir is a red French wine grape variety. It was previously widely cultivated in southern France, in particular in Provence, but is now very rare, almost extinct. Historically used as mainly a blending variety, Calitor gives high yields and produces a light-bodied and lightly colored wine. When grown on hillside sites, it can give a wine of character. Calitor is a very old variety that was first noted growing in southern France in 1600. The grape has produced two color mutations, Calitor blanc, which has been growing in the Costières de Nîmes region since at least 1782, and a pink-berried Calitor gris which are both not widely grown. Plantings of Calitor noir, itself, have been steadily declining since the early 20th century as French wine producers turned first to the more reliably productive Aramon noir and later to higher quality international varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. In 1968, there were 319 hectares (790 acres) of Calitor noir in France but by 2008 that number had dropped to just 31 hectares (77 acres)."
"Enfariné noir (or Gouais noir) is a red French wine grape variety that is grown predominantly in the Jura wine region of eastern France. Despite being known under the synonym Gouais noir in the Aisne, Aube, Marne, Meuse and Seine-et-Marne departments, the grape has no known connection to the Gouais blanc wine grape that is the parent of several wine grape varieties such as Chardonnay, Gamay and Melon de Bourgogne. While once widely planted throughout the Franche-Comté, the grape is now nearly extinct with less than 1 hectare (2.5 acres) of the variety planted in 2008."
"Garanoir is a variety of red wine grape. It was created by and at Station Fédérale de Recherches en Production Végétale de Changins in 1970 by crossing Gamay and Reichensteiner. Garanoir was developed for cultivation in German Switzerland, and is a full sibling of Gamaret, which was intended for the French part of the country. Total Swiss plantations of the variety in 2009 stood at 203 hectares (500 acres). It is grown in both French and German Switzerland. Garanoir has relatively good resistance to rot and ripens early. It gives dark purple wines, which are fruitier, lighter and less concentrated than those of Gamaret."
"Mornen noir is a red French wine grape variety that was historically grown in both the Rhône and Loire departments but is today only found in very limited plantings around the commune of Chavanay. It was thought that the grape was also to be found growing in Hungary under the names Kékmedoc and Medoc noir, but DNA analysis has confirmed that the Hungarian plantings are actually a separate variety now known as (which is listed in the Vitis International Variety Catalogue a cross between Chasselas and Muscat D'Eisenstadt.) DNA profiling has also revealed a potential parent-offspring relationship between Mornen noir and Chasselas and at one time Mornen noir was thought to be a dark-berried color mutation of Chasselas. ('Mornen' is itself a synonym of 'Chasselas'.) While ampelographers have confirmed that Mornen noir is not a Chasselas color mutation, the grape's exact relationship with Chasselas has not yet been determined."
"Brun Argenté or Vaccarèse is a red wine grape that is grown primarily in the Rhone Valley in France. It is a permitted grape in the blend of Châteauneuf-du-Pape, where the name Vaccarèse is used. However, in 2004 only 0.15% of the appellation's surface was planted with the variety. In similarity to Muscardin and Aubun, Brun Argenté is indigenous to this area of France. Descriptions of the grape's character diverge somewhat. It has been described as having similar characteristics as Syrah, producing wines with a peppery and tannic structure, but also as similar to Cinsaut and a producer of light red wines. The vine tends to bud late and is sensitive to downy mildew."
"Wildbacher is a dark-skinned grape variety and specialty of the Styria region of Austria. It is a very old variety said to go back to the Celts, and manuscripts first record the name in the 16th century. The variety is not particularly demanding in terms of soil though it does require warm sites with sufficient aeration as it is prone to rot. The grapes tend to ripen late and yields can be inconsistent. Wines made from Wildbacher typically exhibit red berry and herbal flavors with a refreshing acidity."
"Agh Shani (Azerbaijani: Ağ şanı) (also known as Agh Shany or White Shani) is a light yellow-skinned white table grape that have also been exported and are grown in various regions of Azerbaijan and in Derbend, Astrakhan and Volgograd, Russia."
Sciascinoso is a variety of red grape from Campania in the south of Italy. The clusters and berries are large. The cluster is slightly conical or cylindrical. It produces very colourful wines which are drunk within a year. It is usually blended with Piedirosso and Aglianico wines. About 440 hectares were under cultivation in 1999. Sciascinoso is used to make red Lacryma Christi wine.
"Ruby Roman is a variety of table grape grown and marketed entirely in Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan. It is red in color and about the size of a ping-pong ball. The first Ruby Roman grapes went on sale in August 2008 for 100,000 Japanese yen (US$910) per 700-gram bunch, or $26 per grape. They are said to be the most expensive variety of grapes. In July 2016, a single bunch of Ruby Roman grapes, containing 26 grapes at a weight of about 700 grams, sold for 1.1 million yen (around $8400) in the year's first auction at a wholesale market in Kanazawa."
"Complexa is red Portuguese wine grape used in the production of Madeira. The grape was created as a crossing of Castelao, Muscat Hamburg and Tintinha in the 1960s. The grape provides a deep color with less tannins than the commonly used Tinta Negra Mole."
"Negoska is a red Greek wine grape variety (Negushka) that is grown primarily in ""Central Macedonia"". Around the town of Goumenissa the grape is blended with Xynomavro to produce very fruity wines with high alcohol levels."
"Petit Rouge is a red Italian wine grape variety that ampelographers believe is indigenous to the Valle d'Aosta (French: Vallée d'Aoste) region of northwest Italy. However, there is some confusion about whether Petit Rouge is the same variety as the red Swiss wine grape . The grape is somewhat obscure and is not widely grown outside the Valle d'Aosta where it is primarily a blending variety but some varietal wines are produced. In blends, it adds floral aroma notes and dark color to the wines."
"Freisa is a red Italian wine grape variety grown in the Piedmont region of north-west Italy, primarily in Monferrato and in the Langhe, but also further north in the provinces of Turin and Biella. Freisa is a vigorous and productive vine whose round, blue-black grapes are harvested in early October. The three-lobed leaves are relatively small and the bunches are elongated in form. By the 1880s it had become one of the major Piedmontese grapes, and in that period its cultivation was stimulated by the vine’s resistance to the downy mildew caused by the Plasmopara viticola fungus. Wines made from the Freisa grape are red and usually somewhat sweet and lightly sparkling, or foaming. Still and fully sparkling versions are also produced, however, as are dry and more decidedly sweet styles. In the Canavese there is also a rosé which can be made primarily from Freisa according to Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) regulations."
"Lacrima is a rare red wine grape that is native to the Marche region of Italy. It is almost entirely found in the Italian DOC Lacrima di Morro d'Alba. The grape's name (meaning ""tear"" in Italian) is derived from its tear-like shape, or, alternatively, its thin skin that allows tear-like drops of juice to drip from the grape. Lacrima is low in tannins and is considered usually best for drinking young."
"Žametovka (also known as Ametovka and Kavčina črna) is a red Slovenian wine grape variety. This is one of the oldest domesticated grape varieties in Slovenian. Formerly it was popular in Styrian vineyards, and even more so, even today, known in Dolenjska in southeast Slovenia - from the reddish wine cviček. It produces a wine of pure red color. A single vine of Žametovka growing in the Slovenian town of Maribor is estimated by the Guinness Book of Records to be the oldest living vine still producing fruit in the world at over 400 years of age."
"Forcallat tinta is a red Spanish wine grape variety that is native to the Castile-La Mancha region of central Spain, as well as in Alicante and Valencia provinces in the Valencian Community. The name of the cultivar means ""forked"" in Valencian, which probably refers to the bunches having a wing or shoulder, rather than a tendency to produce forked vines as suggested by Favà. It tends to produce pale-colored wines and is most often used as a minor blending component in Vino de la Tierra (VdlT) wines. It is an authorized variety in the Comunitat Valenciana, where it has become almost extinct and only a few wine makers like are making efforts to recover it, with interesting proposals like La forcallà d'Antònia. Extant plots are found in Fontanars dels Alforins, La Font de la Figuera, Villena and probably Moixent, though the cultivar was once a prevailing one in and Alto Vinalopó regions. in Villena (Alicante) with vineyards in neighbouring Almansa (Albacete) also works with the variety, offering wines from biodinamic and organic farming. DNA profiling conducted in the early 21st century determined that the white berried grape is a distinct variety and not a color mutation of Forcallat tinta. The white cultivar Trepadell is also called Forcallat blanc in the village of La Font de la Figuera, with only one remaining plot of about 600 plants. is also present in the Marina Alta region and has been elaborated by ."
Flot rouge is a red hybrid grape that is a crossing of Munson (also known as Jaeger 70) and the Languedoc-Roussillon wine grape Aramon noir. The grape was created by French viticulturalist Albert Seibel and was crossed with the Seibel grape 405 to create Seibel 6150 which was one of the parent varieties for which is still grown in New York.
"Pamid is an old grape variety used for red wine. It has been cultivated in Bulgaria since the times of the ancient Thracians. In the past, it was the most widely spread Bulgarian variety, but today its plantations are highly limited. Pamid is also cultivated in Yugoslavia, Albania, Turkey, Greece, Hungary and Romania. The bunch is medium-sized (10–16 cm), and the grape is small (14–15 mm) and juicy. The skin is thin, red or sometimes dark red. It has excellent fertility, and its vintage is around the middle of September. Its yield is about 4–5 kg. It does not need any particular kind of soil, but the grapes with best quality are cultivated in hilly areas with light drained soils. This grape accumulates sufficient sugar – from 18 to 24% – but its acidity is low: 4–5 g/dm3. The wines are red, light table wines for mass consumption. They have low acidity and low extract and that is why they are not appropriate for maturing and should be consumed young, right after fermentation and clarification."
"Camaraou noir is a red French wine grape variety that was historically grown in South West France but is now more widely planted in the Spanish wine region of Galicia where it is known as Espadeiro. However, despite its Spanish synonym Camaraou noir has no relationship to the Portuguese wine grape Espadeiro that is used to make red Vinho Verde. The grape may have some relation to the Jurançon and Béarn wine grape Camaralet de Lasseube which is also known as Camaraou blanc but DNA analysis has shown that the two varieties are distinct and not color mutations of one or the other."
Kratosija (Macedonian: Кратошија) (also Kratoshija or Kratoshiya) is a red wine grape variety grown in the Tikveš wine-growing region of North Macedonia. This wine is characterized by an intense ruby-red color and aroma of red berry fruits.
"Pineau d'Aunis (also known as Chenin noir) is a red French wine grape variety that is grown primarily in the Loire Valley around Anjou and Touraine. A favorite of Henry Plantagenet, the English king had Pineau d'Aunis wine first brought to England in 1246. Today the grape is permitted in several Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) wine regions of the Loire Valley, including Cheverny and . While a red wine grape, Pineau d'Aunis is often treated like Pinot noir and used to make rosé and white wines in both still and sparkling wine styles."
"Vuillermin (French: [vyjɛʁmɛ̃]) is a red Italian wine grape variety grown along the border of Switzerland in the Aosta Valley of northwest Italy. First documented under the name Vuillermin in 1890, the grape was virtually extinct until it was discovered by ampelographers at the of Aosta growing in isolated vineyards in communes of Châtillon and Pontey."
"Bombino nero is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown in southern Italy, particularly the regions of Apulia, Basilicata, and Lazio, as well as on the island of Sardinia. It is a permitted grape variety in the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) wines of Castel del Monte and Lizzano. The grape is primarily a blending grape but it can also be used as a varietal for red and rosé wines. Though DNA evidence has shown that Bombino nero is not a dark-berried color mutation of the similarly named Bombino bianco, ampelographers still believe that the two varieties are related in some way."
"Joubertin is a red French wine grape variety that was historically grown in the Savoie wine region of southeast France. The grape was once prized for its productivity and high yields but its plantings have declined as the grape has fallen out of favor and it is now on the verge of extinction. In the 20th century, ampelographers and (decades later) Linda Bisson categorized Joubertin as a member of the Peloursin eco-geogroup along with Bia blanc, , Dureza, , Durif, Jacquère, Mondeuse blanche, Peloursin, Servanin and Verdesse."
Cornifesto is a red Portuguese wine grape variety that is used in the production of Port. In Port production it is considered a minor grape that is usually used to make lighter bodied wines.It originated from the crossing of Castellana Blanca and Alfrocheiro Preto.
"Albarossa is a red Italian wine grape variety that was created in the Veneto wine region in 1938 by grape breeder at the in Conegliano. Dalmasso originally thought he created the grape from a crossing of Nebbiolo and Barbera but DNA profiling in 2009 confirmed that the ""Nebbiolo"" vine used wasn't Nebbiolo at all but rather a very old French wine grape variety from the Ardèche, Chatus. The confusion stemmed from a synonym of Chatus, Nebbiolo di Dronero (Nebbiolo of Dronero, a small commune in the Piedmont wine region where Nebbiolo is grown but so apparently was Chatus)."
"Rimava is a red Slovak wine grape variety that is a crossing of the Southwest France wine grapes Abouriou and Castets. The variety was created in 1976 at the in Modra. The grape was named after the Rimava river, a tributary of the Sajó. Along with , Hron and , which were created using the same parent varieties, Rimava was officially authorized for commercial wine production in 2011."
"Valdiguié is a red wine grape grown primarily in the Languedoc-Roussillon region of southern France, where it is generally known by the alias Gros Auxerrois. In California it has been known as Napa Gamay or Gamay 15. Until 1980 Napa Gamay was believed to be the Gamay of Beaujolais, but following genetic analysis the name ""Napa Gamay"" has been banned from U.S. wine labels since January 1999. Confusingly, both the Pinot noir clone Gamay Beaujolais and Valdiguié were sometimes also labelled as ""Gamay Beaujolais"" until that name was banned on labels on April 2007. Other synonyms include Valdiguer, Cahors, Jean-Pierrou at Sauzet, Quercy and Noir de Chartres."
"Uva Tosca is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Emilia-Romagna region of east-central Italy where it is the only grape variety able to grow in the higher elevations of the Val Secchia area. Despite what its name may allude to, ampelographers have little evidence to believe that the grape originated in Tuscany or has any close genetic relationship with the notable Tuscan wine grape, Sangiovese, that is also known under the synonym of Uva Tosca. In 2010, DNA analysis suggested that Uva Tosca may be a natural crossing between the Alto-Adige wine grape Schiava Grossa and ."
"Hron is a red Slovak wine grape variety that is a crossing of the Southwest France wine grapes Abouriou and Castets. The variety was created in 1976 at the in Modra. The grape was named after the Hron river, a tributary of the Danube that is the second longest river in Slovakia. Along with , Rimava and , which were created using the same parent varieties, Hron was officially authorized for commercial wine production in 2011."
"Rossola nera is a red Italian wine grape variety that has been growing in the Valtellina region of Lombardy since at least the 17th century. In 2004 DNA profiling determined that the grape has a parent-offspring relationship with the Piedmont wine grape Nebbiolo though which variety is the parent and which is the offspring is not yet clear. However, most ampelographers believe that Nebbiolo is likely the parent variety since written records in Piedmont have noted Nebbiolo being grown since at least the 13th century."
San Giuseppe nero is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown in central Italy where it is a permitted variety in the Indicazione geografica tipica (IGT) wines of the Lazio region. Some plantings of the grape can be found in southern Italy which combined with the central Italy plantings gave San Giuseppe nero a total of 387 hectares (960 acres) reported in the official 2000 Italian viticultural census.
"Tibouren or Rossese di Dolceacqua is a red French wine grape variety that is primarily grown in Provence and Liguria but originated in Greece and possibly even the Middle East. Intensely aromatic, with an earthy bouquet that wine expert Jancis Robinson describes as garrigue, Tibouren is often used in the production of rosés. While the unique aroma and character of the wines produced by Tibouren are valued by producers, it is not a widely planted variety. This is due, in part, to the viticultural issues of the grape's sensitivity to coulure and tendency to produce highly irregular yields from vintage to vintage. The wines produced from Rossese are a local specialty found around Dolceacqua."
"Bonamico is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the province of Pisa in Tuscany where the grape has a reputation for producing very high yields. Some ampelographers speculate that the grape may have originated around the town of Palaia with the grape being known under the synonym of Uva di Palaia. While often used as a table grape, Bonamico can be a minor blending component in several Tuscan Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) and Indicazione Geografica Tipica (IGT) wines where it often contributes floral aroma notes and acidity."
Acitana is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown in northeast Sicily where it is often blended with Nerello Cappuccio and Nerello Mascalese around the village of Messina though Acitana is officially not a permitted variety for wines labeled under the local .
"Douce Noire grise or (Dame Noire grise) is a red French grape variety that was described by ampelographer Pierre Galet in his 2000 work Dictionnaire encyclopédique des cépages but is not longer used in commercial wine production. Despite the similarities in their names, Douce Noire grise is not a color mutation of, or directly related to, the French wine grape Douce noir which is also known as Bonarda in Argentina and Charbono in California."
"Pallagrello nero is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown in Campania. The grape has a long history in the region and, like the similarly named Pallagrello bianco, was one of the varieties planted in 1775 by architect and engineer Luigi Vanvitelli in the fan-shaped Vigna del Ventaglio vineyard created for the royal palace of King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies (Ferdinand IV of Naples) in Caserta. Following the phylloxera epidemic of the mid-19th century and the economic devastation of the World Wars of the early 20th century, plantings of Pallagrello nero declined greatly and the variety was thought to be extinct until it was rediscovered growing in an abandoned Campanian vineyard in the 1990s. Despite having similar names and both varieties originated in Campania, Pallagrello nero is not a color mutation of the white Campanian wine grape Pallagrello bianco though DNA profiling has not determined yet if the two varieties are closely related. Likewise, despite Pallagrello nero also being known under the synonym of Coda di Volpe nera, DNA analysis has ruled out a relationship with the white Campanian wine grape, Coda di Volpe, which, itself, is also known under the synonym Pallagrello and has similar looking ""fox tail-shaped"" grape clusters. There is some DNA evidence to suggest that Pallagrello nero maybe related to an old red Campania variety grown in the province of Caserta known as but the exact extent of that relationship is not yet known."
Rufete is a red Spanish/Portuguese wine grape variety that is grown primarily used in port wine production in the Douro region of Portugal. It is also grown up along the Duero basin across the border in the Spanish province of Castile and León and can be found in the Dão DOC of Portugal where the variety is known as Tinta Pinheira.
"Avanà is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Piedmont wine region of northwest Italy. Historically, the grape has also been grown in the Dauphiné and Savoie wine region of eastern France where it was known as Hibou noir and in the Valais region of Switzerland. The grape is most often used as a blending variety in the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) zones of Pinerolese, with Barbera, Persan, Freisa and , and Valsusa, with Barbera, Dolcetto, Neretta Cuneese and other local red Piemontese varieties."
"Uvalino is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Piedmont wine region of northwest Italy. While the name uvalino means ""small berries"", ampelographers believe that the name may be derived from uvario which in the local Piedmontese dialect was used to denote wine grapes that were primarily minor blending varieties. In recent years, the high levels of the antioxidant resveratrol of Uvalino has brought attention to the grape due to its potential health benefits."
"Colombana nera is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown in Emilia-Romagna and Tuscany. Despite similarities in name, the grape did not get its name from nor is it grown in the San Colombano al Lambro region of Lombardy nor is it permitted in the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) wine of the same name. Rather, ampelographers believe that Colombana nera is named after the Abbey of San Colombano located in the commune of Bobbio in the Piacenza province of Emilia-Romagna where the grape has had a long history of cultivation."
Rossignola is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Veneto wine region of northeast Italy. The variety was first mentioned growing in the province of Verona in the early 19th century and today is a permitted blending variety in several Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) wines of the Veneto including Bardolino and Valpolicella.
Brun Fourca is a red French wine grape variety that once grew widely throughout Provence and Southwest France but is now limited to small plantings within the Palette Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC).
"Catanese nero is a red Italian wine grape variety that is predominantly grown in Sicily. While ampelographers believe that grape likely originated in the shadow of Mount Etna in province of Catania on the east coast of the island, today it is mostly grown in the northwestern provinces of Agrigento, Palermo and Trapani. A minor blending variety used in rosé production, the grape is not currently permitted for use in any Denominazione di origine controllata classified wines."
"Milgranet is a red French wine grape variety that is predominantly grown in the Toulouse region of South West France. In addition to the red skin variety, there exist a rarer white skin clone known as Milgranet blanc that is often not seen in wine production. According to wine expert Jancis Robinson, Milgranet produces deeply colored wines with a firm tannic structure."
"Trevisana nera is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Veneto region of northeast Italy. While ampelographers believe that the name Trevisana suggest that the grape originated in the province of Treviso, today the grape is almost exclusively found in the northern province of Belluno, particularly around the commune of Feltre, where the grape is a permitted variety in the Indicazione geografica tipica (IGT) zone of Vigneti delle Dolomiti."
"Castets is a red French wine grape variety that was historically grown in the Aveyron region of France. While some plantings exist in Southwest France, the variety's numbers are dwindling and is now nearly extinct. In Slovakia, Castets was crossed with Abouriou to create several varieties including Hron, , Rimava and ."
"Piccola nera is red Italian and Slovenian wine grape variety that is grown in the province of Trieste within the Friuli-Venezia Giulia wine region and across the border in neighboring Slovenia where ampelographers believe that the grape originated. Piccola nera, whose name means ""little black"", tends to produce to light bodied red and rosé wines that are meant to be consumed young. It is a permitted variety in the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) wines of Carso where it is usually blended with Terrano and in Venezia Indicazione geografica tipica IGT classification where the grape can be used to make varietal wines."
"Gouget noir is a red French wine grape variety that is grown in the Allier and Cher departments of central France. The grape was once widely planted with almost 17,000 hectares (42,008 acres) in the mid-19th century but the phylloxera epidemic greatly diminished it numbers and as of 2008 there was just 10 hectares (25 acres) of the grape planted in France."
"Téoulier is a red French wine grape variety found in south east France. Ampelographers speculate that the grape may have originated around the Provençal town of Manosque due to the town's close association with several synonyms of the variety. For most of the 20th century, plantings of Téoulier have steadily declined and today is rarely found. There is also a white mutation of the variety known as Téoulier blanc."
"Bonda is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Aosta Valley region of northwest Italy around the communes of Châtillon and Quart. Historically the grape has been confused with another grape of Aosta, , but DNA analysis in the early 21st century showed that the two grapes were distinct and not closely related. Despite being known under the synonym of Prié rouge, Bonda is not a color mutation of Prié blanc nor do the two grapes seem to be closely related."
"Magliocco Canino is a red Italian wine grape variety that is predominantly grown in the Calabria region of southern Italy. It is often used as a blending grape, often with Gaglioppo of which the varieties are often confused. In the late 20th century there was just over 1500 ha (3700 acres) of Magliocco Canino planted."
Fuella is a red wine grape that is grown primarily in the Bellet region near Nice. It is considered one of the oldest vines in southeastern France and produces wines that are deep colored and reflective of their terroir. It is often made into rosés.
"Cygne blanc is a white Australian wine grape variety that is a seedling of Cabernet Sauvignon that was discovered in 1989 in Western Australia. Unlike Cabernet blanc, which was a crossing of Cabernet Sauvignon and , and Shalistin which is a white-berried color mutation of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cygne blanc is a selfling that sprang from a seed of a Cabernet Sauvignon berry that fell on the ground and took root. Indigenous to Australia, Cygne blanc has been touted as the ""first truly Australian grape variety""."
Tinta Miuda is a Portuguese red wine grape that is grown primarily in the Oeste and Ribatejo regions. The grape is often used in the production of blended bulk and table wines but can also be used to produce varietal wine.
"Avarengo is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Piedmont wine region of northwest Italy where it is a permitted blending component in the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) wines of Pinerolese. Here the grape is usually blended with Avanà, and other local red Piemontese varieties."
"Bracciola nera is a red Italian wine grape variety that is primarily found in the Liguria and Toscana wine regions of western Italy. The only Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) that Bracciola nera plays a significant role is in the Colli di Luni DOC of Ligura where the grape is permitted to be blended with Sangiovese, Canaiolo, Pollera nera, Ciliegiolo, Vermentino nero and other varieties. A late-ripening variety, Bracciola nera usually contributes acidity to blends."
"Uva Rara is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Piedmont and Lombardy wine regions of northern Italy. The grape is a permitted blending variety along with Nebbiolo in the Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) wines of Ghemme. In the Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) wine region of Oltrepò Pavese the grape is often blended with Barbera and Croatina. While Uva Rara's name means ""rare grape"" in Italian, the variety is actually widely planted with 608 hectares (1,502 acres) of the vine recorded in Italy in 2000."
"Aglianicone is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Campania and Basilicata region of southern Italy. Despite the similarities in naming, Aglianicone is not a clonal mutation of Aglianico but DNA analysis does suggest a close genetic relationship between the two varieties. The grape has a reputation of being a high yielding vine that produces wines of generally low quality. In 2000, there were 140 hectares (350 acres) of Aglianicone planted."
"Brugnola is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Lombardy wine region of Valtellina. While historically, Brugnola was thought to be a local synonym for Emilia-Romagna wine grape Fortana, DNA analysis has shown that the two grapes are distinct variety and that, instead, Brugnola shares a close genetic relationship with the Piedmont wine grape Nebbiolo. Today, Brugnola is a permitted grape variety in the Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) of with the grape most often seen from the Valtellina subzone of Grumello."
"Gueuche noir is a red French wine grape variety that has been historically grown in the Franche-Comté of eastern France but is now close to being extinct. Though its exact relationship has not yet been determined by DNA analysis, ampelographers believe that the grape variety is closely related to the Hunnic grape Gouais blanc which is notable for being the mother vine to several grape varieties including Chardonnay and Gamay. There also might be a relationship between Gueuche noir and the Jura wine grape Enfariné noir."
"Vien de Nus is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown primarily in the Valle d'Aosta DOC. It is particularly associated with the town of Nus where it is the primary grape in the Nus Rosso wine of the region. Outside of this region, the grape is rarely found elsewhere and is nearly extinct."
"Étraire de la Dui (also known simply as Étraire) is a red French wine grape variety that was historically grown in the Rhone and Savoy wine regions. Its numbers were hit hard following the phylloxera epidemic and now only a few plantings remain in Savoy and the southeast fringes of the Rhone valley. According to wine expert Jancis Robinson, the grape produces a wine similar in style to Persan and can produce wine with aging potential."
"Arrouya noir is a red French wine grape variety grown in the Jurançon region of Southwest France. The grape has a long history in the region, growing in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques since at least the late 18th century. Ampelographers believe that Arrouya noir has some genetic relationship with Camaraou noir, Fer and Petit Courbu though the exact nature of those relationships is not yet known. The variety also shares some similarities in morphology with Cabernet Franc and until the late 19th century was often confused for the Loire and Bordeaux wine grape, especially in the Basses-Pyrénées and Hautes-Pyrénées region."
"Petit Bouschet is a red teinturier grape variety that is a crossing of Aramon noir and created in 1824 by French grape breeder at his vineyard in Mauguio in the Hérault department. The grape was used by Louis' son, Henri Bouschet, to create several more varieties including Alicante Bouschet, Grand Noir de la Calmette and Morrastel Bouschet. Petit Bouschet saw a surge of plantings in the late 19th century as France recovered from the phylloxera epidemic where it was often used to add color to blends made from hybrid grapes and other high yielding varieties. As its offspring Alicante Bouschet became more popular, plantings of Petit Bouschet fell off and the grape is now hardly found in France."
"Fumin is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown primarily in the Valle d'Aosta region of northwest Italy. According to wine expert Jancis Robinson, the grape is ""tough"" and used primarily as a blending grape in the Denominazione di origine controllatas (DOCs) of the region. The grape is one of the parent varieties of the Aosta wine grape Vuillermin."
"Tinta Carvalha is a red Portuguese wine grape variety that is widely planted throughout Portugal, most notably in the Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro Province, due to its easy maintenance and high yield potential. It is primarily a blending grape that on its own tends to produce light bodied, nondescript wines. It is an approved grape variety used in Port wine production as well as the non-fortified wines of the Chaves and Valpaços wine region."
"Gros Verdot is a red French wine grape variety that was a historically important grape in the Gironde wine region of Bordeaux but plantings of the variety have been banned in the region since 1946 with the grape no longer being a permitted variety in any AOC Bordeaux wines. Today the grape is not widely cultivated with limited plantings in France, Chile and California where it is an acceptable component in Bordeaux-style Meritage blends. Despite the similar name, ampelographers believe there is no direct genetic relation between Gros Verdot and Petit Verdot."
Pascale di Cagliari is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown in Sardinia.
"Barbera Sarda is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown on the island of Sardinia where it often used to add acidity to blends. Despite the similarities in their names, there is no known close genetic relationship between the Sardinian Barbera and the notable Piedmontese wine grape variety Barbera. Nor does there seem to be any close relationship with other grapes names Barbera, such as Barbera bianca and Barbera del Sannio."
"Grisa nera is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Piedmont wine region of northwest Italy where it is used in both winemaking and as a table grape. The grape is most often used as a minor blending component with wines made from Barbera, and Plassa."
"Vermentino nero is a red Italian wine grape variety that is predominantly grown in province of Massa-Carrara in Tuscany. After World War II, the vine was almost lost to extinction until Podere Scurtarola, a producer from Massa, began replanting old vineyards with the grape. By 2000, there were 199 hectares (492 acres) of Vermentino nero growing in Italy with the grape authorized for production in the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) wines of Candia dei Colli Apuani and Colline Lucchesi. The grape was long believed to a dark-berried color mutation of Vermentino though some ampelographers believe that the grape may have Spanish origins and be related to Monastrell or the Aragonese grape Parraleta used in the wines of Somontano. As of 2012, DNA profiling on the grape variety has not been able to confirm or deny either theory."
"Morrastel Bouschet is red French wine grape variety that is a crossing of the Spanish wine Vitis vinifera grape Graciano and the red-fleshed teinturier Bouschet Petit. The grape is often confused with its parent vine, Graciano, that is known as Morrastel in France and Uzbekistan, the Moristel grape from Aragon, as well as Mourvèdre which is known as Monastrell in Spain. Today Morrastel Bouschet is found mostly in the Aude and Hérault departments of southern France."
"Canari noir is a red French wine grape variety that has been historically grown in the Ariège department in the foothills of the French Pyrénées. However DNA profiling in 2001 showed that plantings of a grape called Gamay Luverdon growing in the Italian wine region of Piedmont were in fact plantings of Canari noir. Across the Pyrénées in Spain, the grape variety known as Batista was also found to be identical to Canari noir. Like Pinot noir and Grenache, Canari noir has color mutations known as Canari blanc and Canari gris."
"Nielluccio is a red wine grape variety that is widely planted on Corsica. It is the principal grape variety used in the production of the Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée AOC red wine Patrimonio, where it must by law make up 95% of the blend. An early budding vine, Nielluccio produces wines lacking in color and with high alcohol levels. It is commonly used to make rosé wine. There is confusion about the grape's exact origins with some wine experts describing the grape as being indigenous to Corsica while other theories report that the grape is of Italian origins and possibly even a genetically identical clone of the Tuscan wine grape Sangiovese that came to Corsica from Genoa."
"Cesanese Comune (more commonly known as just Cesanese) is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown primarily in the Lazio region. The grape has three Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) regions dedicated to it-, and . Cesanese di Affile appears to be a distinct sub-variety of Cesanese Comune unique to the commune of Affile. (much like Brunello is a unique clone of Sangiovese unique to commune of Montalcino) There are noticeable differences between Cesanese Comune and the grapes found in Cesanese di Affile, including the size of the grape berry itself. The sub-variety Cesanese d'Affile is considered to be of superior quality of Cesanese Comune and is used as minor ingredient in the Tuscan cult wine . The grape has very old origins, and may have been used in Roman winemaking. Today it is rarely seen outside of the Lazio."
"Valentino nero is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Piedmont wine region of northwest Italy but was initially bred at the Conegliano research center in the Veneto. In 1936, its creator, , stated that the grape was a crossing of two Vitis vinifera Piedmontese varieties, Nebbiolo and Dolcetto, but DNA profiling in 2009 showed that the French wine grape Chatus and Dolcetto were the parent vines."
"Magliocco Dolce (also known as Marsigliana nera) is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown mostly in the Calabria region of southern Italy. In agricultural census counts, plantings of Magliocco Dolce are often grouped with the related, but distinct, red grape variety Magliocco Canino. Throughout history, numerous red southern Italian wine grape varieties have been variously known under the synonyms of ""Magliocco"" or ""Magliocchi"", most notably Gaglioppo, but recent DNA analysis has shown those grapes to be unrelated to Magliocco Dolce or Magliocco Canino."
Œillade noire (French pronunciation: ​[œjad nwaʁ]) is a red French wine grape variety that has been historically grown in the Languedoc and Provence wine region but it is now close to extinction. The grape is often confused for the Rhone wine grape Cinsault which is known under the synonym œillade noire when it is sold as a table grape. It was also once thought to be a color mutation of Picardan which is known as œillade blanche and share several similar synonyms to œillade noire. However the grape has no known relation to both Cinsault and Picardan.
"Ederena is a red French wine grape variety that is a crossing of the Bordeaux wine grape Merlot and the Southwest France variety Abouriou. The grape was created in 1952 at the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA) center in Bordeaux. In the United States, Ederena is being cultivated by E & J Gallo Winery and the University of California, Davis in the San Joaquin Valley. There is also some plantings of the grape in Switzerland. The name Ederena comes from the Basque ederrena which means ""the most beautiful""."
"Termarina rossa is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Emilia-Romagna region of northern Italy. The grape is unique among Vitis vinifera varieties in that it is naturally seedless. Historically Termarina rossa was grown in the provinces of Parma and Reggio Emilia for use in production of jams and saba, a sweet syrup, made from boiling the must but today it is used as a blending variety in some of Indicazione geografica tipica (IGT) wines of the area."
"Barsaglina is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown in Tuscany and Liguria where it most often used to add color and tannins to blends. Some ampelographers speculate that grape may be related to Sangiovese due to morphological similarities. Barsaglina was near extinction until a Tuscan wine producer, , help revive the variety by making it a significant component of his red Indicazione Geografica Tipica (IGT) Toscana blend. The grape is also permitted to be used in the Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) wines of Colli di Luni."
"Persan is a red French wine grape variety that is grown primarily in the Savoie region. While the name hints at a Persian origins for the grape, it is most likely native to the Rhône-Alpes region with the name ""Persan"" being a corruption of the synonym ""Princens"" which is also the name of a small hamlet by Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne in Savoie which has been noted since the 17th century for the quality of its vineyards."
Negrara is a red Italian wine grape variety grown in north east Italy including the Veneto region where it is a permitted variety in the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) wine Amarone.

In Argentina the grape is known as Criolla Chica."
"Plassa (also known as Scarlattino) is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Piedmont wine region of northwest Italy where it was once historically used as a table grape but now is almost always used for winemaking. Here the grape is most often used as a minor blending component adding tannins to wines made from Barbera, , Grisa nera and Chatus."
"Bouteillan noir is a red French wine grape variety that is grown in the Provence wine region of southern France. While the grape has been recorded growing in the Vaucluse region since at least the early 18th century, today the grape is virtually extinct. Despite sharing synonyms with another Provençal grape, Calitor, and the Languedoc wine grape Aramon noir, Bouteillan noir has no known relationship with either of those variety. The white Provençal grape (not to be confused with the Cognac and South African wine grape Colombard) was once thought to be a white berried color mutation of Bouteillan noir but research conducted by Dr. Linda Bisson of the University of California, Davis shows that while the two grapes are likely related, one is not a color mutation of the other."
Salvador is a red wine grape that is grown primarily in the Central Valley of California with some experimental plantings in Washington state. The grape is normally used as a teinturier imparting some of its deep coloring to the blend. The grape's juice has a gelatin like texture and is difficult to extract from its small bunches.

"Barbera del Sannio is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Campania region of southern Italy. Despite the similarities in name and appearance, the grape has no close genetic relationship with the Piedmont wine grapes Barbera or Barbera bianca or the Sardinian wine grape Barbera Sarda and is, instead, more closely related to the Campanian varieties and and the Apulian grape Nero di Troia. In Campania, Barbera del Sannio is often used as a blending variety that adds color and aroma notes to the wine but it is also permitted to be made as a varietal wine in Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) of ."
"Rossolino nero is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Valtellina region of Lombardy in northern Italy. The grape was once thought to be a clone of Rossola nera but DNA profiling in the late 20th and early 21st century has shown that the two grapes are distinct varieties but are likely related. Around the village of Teglio, a pink-skinned color mutation of Rossolino nero exist that is known as Rossolino Rosa."
"Tarrango is a red grape variety used in Australian wine production. This slow-ripening grape was created in 1965 by the CSIRO Horticultural Research Station at Merbein in Victoria, Australia, as a hybrid of Touriga Nacional and Sultana in order to create wines of good acidity, but low in tannin. Its wines are often similar to Beaujolais in style. Requiring an unusually warm climate, it is principally grown in the wine-producing areas of northern Victoria. Brown Brothers has been the most prominent producer since the 1980s, selling Tarrango as a rosé."
"Perricone (also known as Pignatello) is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown in Sicily.

During the 19th century, the grape was known by several other names, including the Los Angeles grape, and the California grape."
"Girò is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown on Sardinia and is used mostly in the production of fortified wines in the Giro di Cagliari Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC). The grape was once widely planted throughout Sardinia but its plantings were decimated when the phylloxera epidemic hit the island at the end of the nineteenth century. At the turn of the 21st century there were 552 hectares (1,364 acres) of the grape planted throughout Italy, mostly in the Sardinian provinces of Cagliari and Oristano."
"Cienna is a red Australian wine grape variety first harvested in 2000. It is a mix between the Spanish wine grape Sumoll and Cabernet Sauvignon grape. This grape was initially created in 1972 by CSIRO. The aim was to produce high quality grapes suited for Australian conditions. One of the most notable wineries that produces a light-style, light-alcohol Cienna wine is Brown Brothers from Victoria, Australia."
"Bouchalès or Grapput is a red French wine grape variety that is grown primarily in Bordeaux and Southwest France wine appellations. Plantings have declined in recent years as the vine has shown high sensitivity to downy mildew and black rot. Old vine plantings of Bouchalès that more than a 100 years exist at in the Fronsac AOC located just northwest of the city of Libourne in the ""Right Bank"" region of Bordeaux. These vines are believed to be some of the oldest vines in Bordeaux (where only 27% of the vines average more than 30 years age ), having likely survived the phylloxera epidemic of the late 19th century due to the ancient Libournais practice of flooding the vineyards in winter which would disrupt the nymph stage in the life cycle of phylloxera."
"Barbarossa is the name of several red/pink colored Italian wine grape varieties. At one point the French wine grape Barbaroux was thought to also be a Barbarossa grape but DNA evidence published in 2009 confirmed that the French Barbaroux grown in Provence was a separate variety distinct from, at least, the Barbarossa grapes grown in Piedmont and Liguria. Further research is still being done map out the exact relation among all the Barbarossa varieties in Italy and with the Barbaroux grape grown in Corsica."
"Italia is a fairly popular Italian seeded white table grape variety. It was bred by Luigi and Alberto Pirovano in Vaprio d'Adda by crossing and Muscat Hamburg in 1911.

"Lakemont is a white table grape, part of the ""Three Sisters"" group, consisting of Himrod, Lakemont, and Interlaken. All are named after cities in the Finger Lakes region of North America. Lakemont ripens later than the other two ""sisters"", but it is sweeter and has bigger fruit, and has a slightly different flavor. Some nurseries claim that Lakemont is more productive than both Himrod and Interlaken."
"Passerina is both a rare local white grape that is found in the Marche, in Italy and a DOC for wines of the same name. Many researchers have studied its identity, so to boast an extensive bibliography and a high number of citations of the grapes on the most famous treatises of ampelography. However, its origins remain uncertain. Known by various names such as ""Pagadebito Gentile"", ""Campolese"" and ""Uva Passera"", the term ""Passerina"" is attributed to those grapes that have small berries often devoid of seeds. Passerina is used in some Marche wine blends, including the DOC Falerio dei Colli Ascolani."
"Roupeiro is a white Portuguese wine grape planted primarily in the Alentejo and Douro regions. In Alentejo, the grape is known as Alva. In the Douro, it is known as Codega."
"Drupeggio (also known as Canaiolo bianco) is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Central Italy wine regions of Tuscany and Orvieto. The grape is often confused for the white Tuscan variety Vernaccia di San Gimignano, which is also known under the synonym Canaiolo bianco and may be counted as one and the same in field blends. Drupeggio is a permitted variety in several Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC)s including Orvieto in Umbria where it is usually blended with Trebbiano, Verdello, Grechetto and Malvasia Toscana and in the red and rosé wines of Barco Reale di Carmignano where it can blended with Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon. It is also a permitted variety for use in Vin Santo production but the grape's limited ability to raisin sufficiently for use in straw wine production makes its appearance in these Italian dessert wines very rare."
"Luglienga (also known as Lignan blanc and Seidentraube) is a white Italian wine and table grape variety that is grown across Europe. The grape has a long history of use, dating back to at least the 14th century in Piedmont but is today most seen a table grape that is occasionally used for home winemaking."

"Pearl of Csaba (Csabagyöngye in Hungarian) is a white variety of grape. It was created in 1904 by the Hungarian viticulturalist , presumably by crossing Madeleine Angevine × Muscat Courtillier (= Muscat Précoce de Saumur). Some sources instead state the parent varieties as Bronner x Muscat Ottonel, but this is seen as less likely. The variety's name was taken from the city Békéscsaba, which is also called Csaba for short. Pearl of Csaba is primarily used as a table grape. Worldwide cultivation is estimated to be around 2,000 hectares (4,900 acres), and it is primarily found in Romania, Hungary and Bulgaria."
"Grenache blanc (also known as garnatxa blanca in Catalonia) is a variety of white wine grape that is related to the red grape Grenache. It is mostly found in Rhône wine blends and in northeast Spain. Its wines are characterized by high alcohol and low acidity, with citrus and or herbaceous notes. Its vigor can lead to overproduction and flabbiness. However, if yields are controlled, it can contribute flavor and length to blends, particularly with Roussanne. Since the 1980s, it has been the fifth most widely planted white wine grape in France after Ugni blanc, Chardonnay, Semillon and Sauvignon blanc."

"Picardan or Picardan blanc is a white wine grape which is one of 13 permitted blending grapes within the Châteauneuf-du-Pape AOC in Rhône wine region in France, although very little planted. The Vitis International Variety Catalogue previously listed Oeillade blanche as the primary name of the variety, but now identifies Araignan as the primary name. However, since the variety is practically unknown for any other use than the Châteauneuf-du-Pape blend, it most commonly goes under the name used for it in that appellation. Picardan gives a wine which considered to be light and rather neutral in character."
"Arbane (or Arbanne) is a white French wine grape variety that has been historically grown in the Aube region of Champagne, but has now all but disappeared from the vineyards with less than 1 hectare (2.5 acres) left in France in 2006. Despite its rarity, it is still permitted grape variety to be blended with Chardonnay, Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier and other varieties in the Champagne cuvée. Recent years have seen a renewed interest in the older, almost extinct grape varieties of the Champagne region, including Arbane. The Champagne house in Buxeuil is the only producer of a """" Champagne made only from Arbane, while a few others, including and Drappier, produce blends which include both Arbane and other now rare Champagne varieties such as Petit Meslier and Pinot blanc. Moutard-Diligent also produce a ""Cuvée Six Cépages"" which uses six of the seven authorized grapes varieties : Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Pinot Meunier, Petit Meslier, Pinot blanc and Arbane; the additional approved grape variety being Fromenteau (Pinot gris)."
"Petit Meslier is a rare white wine grape that is a minor component of some Champagne blends. It is valued for its ability to retain acidity even in hot vintages. In the very rare cases where it is not blended, it makes crisp wines tasting of apples. The Traminer family of grapes can be difficult to grow, with poor disease resistance and low yields."
"Bukettraube (/bu-ket-trau-be/), also called Bouquet Blanc, Bouquettraube, Sylvaner Musqué or Bukettrebe, is a variety of white grape of German origin. is supposed to have created it in Randersacker in the 19th century, although an Alsatian origin has also been claimed. Bukettraube is a cross of Silvaner and Schiava Grossa."
"Goldriesling is a grape variety of the species Vitis vinifera used for white wine. It was created in 1893 by Christian Oberlin in Colmar, Alsace by crossing Riesling with another grape variety, which is sometimes given as , but not identified conclusively. Goldriesling is typically characterised by Muscat-like aromas and high acidity, and ripens fairly early. It has been used as a crossing partner for several other grape varieties including , Léon Millot, Marechal Joffre and Maréchal Foch. Goldriesling is an approved grape variety for German wine, but is almost only cultivated in Saxony, where it covered 17 hectares (42 acres) in 2008."
"Muscat d'Eisenstadt (also known as Muscat de Saumur and Muscat Précoce de Saumur) is a white variety of grape of French origin. It was first cultivated in 1842 by Auguste Courtiller (1795–1875), who created it by selecting seedlings from a Pinot Noir Précoce vine with open pollination. Courtiller worked in the Jardin des Plantes of the city of Saumur. Muscat d'Eisenstadt shows very early ripening, which is indicated by the term ""précoce"" in its name. This property has made Muscat d'Eisenstadt popular to use as a crossing partner for many other grape varieties, including Huxelrebe and possibly including Muscat Ottonel."
"Optima is a white wine grape that was created by viticulturalist at the Geilweilerhof Institute for Grape Breeding in the Palatinate in 1930. Morio crossed a Riesling x Silvaner cross with Müller-Thurgau. The Riesling x Silvaner is sometimes mentioned as Rieslaner, but more often just as ""a Riesling x Silvaner"". Due to the random element of genetic recombination involved in sexual reproduction of plants, no two crosses of the same parent grape varieties will be identical, so there is a difference between the Riesling x Silvaner cross Rieslaner, and each other such cross. Optima received varietal protection and was released for general cultivation in 1970 and 1971, respectively. Its name is derived from the Latin language word for ""the best"". Optima ripens very early, even before other varieties which are considered as early ripening, such as Müller-Thurgau. Its late budding made it popular in the Mosel region, since it thus was less prone to frost damage. It can also grow on poor sites, where more demanding grape varieties such as Riesling do not ripen very reliably. It also easily achieves very impressive must weights, resulting in its use as a booster of Prädikat levels and sweetness in cheap German blended wines, primarily in Rheinhessen and Mosel. This use is similar to the variety Ortega. Varietal wines made from Optima grapes are usually yellow-green in colour, can show aromas similar to Riesling, but are lower in acidity. For this reason they have been described as ""flabby and undistinguished"", and as mentioned above, primarily used in blends. German plantings of Optima peaked at 420 hectares (1,000 acres) in 1990, but in similarity with many other new breeds of white German grapes, Optima has lost popularity in recent years. It is now grown on less than 100 hectares (250 acres) of vineyards in Germany. The remaining plantations are found primarily in Mosel and Rheinhessen. It is known under the synonyms (breeding codes) Geilweilerhof 33-13-113 and Gf. 33-13-113. Optima was used in a crossing to produce the grape variety Orion."
"Bronner is a white grape variety used for wine. It was bred in 1975 by Norbert Becker at the viticultural institute in Freiburg, Germany. The variety was initially known under its breeding code FR 250-75, and was later named in honour of (1792-1864), who was a German pharmacist and viticultural pioneer. It received varietal protection in 1977. Bronner shows good resistance against fungal diseases and is in many respects similar to Pinot blanc."
"Ehrenfelser is a white wine grape variety of German origin. It was created by Dr. Heinrich Birk (1898-1973) at the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute in 1929, by crossing Riesling with what was thought at the time to be Silvaner, but DNA markers have since indicated it was the Alsace variety Knipperlé. Ehrenfelser was first grown primarily in the Palatinate and Rheinhessen regions in Germany, however as is the case with most white German ""new crosses"", plantings within Germany have decreased considerably in recent years. In 2006, only 112 hectares (280 acres) of plantings remained, down from 255 hectares (630 acres) in 1999. Outside Germany, Ehrenfelser has found some success mainly in Canada, in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia. Wineries including Cedar Creek, Lake Breeze, Gray Monk, Gehringer Brothers, Mount Boucherie, Quails' Gate and Summerhill make both still and ice wine styles. There have also been smaller plantings in Washington state and Canterbury, New Zealand. The grape tends to ripen earlier and produce higher yields than Riesling. The variety normally consistently produces grapes of at least Kabinett level ripeness and tends to produce well in vineyards where Riesling has difficulties. Ehrenfelser derives its name from the Burg Ehrenfels ruins located on the Rhine near Rüdesheim. It is also known under the synonym Geisenheim 9-93. Ehrenfelser was crossed with Reichensteiner to create Ehrenbreitsteiner."
"Ehrenbreitsteiner is a white wine grape variety of German origin. It was created by Helmut Becker at the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute in 1964, by crossing the varieties Ehrenfelser and Reichensteiner. It was granted plant variety rights in 1993 and was certified in 1994. Ehrenbreitsteiner was created in a programme where Becker was searching for new grape varieties more resistant to phylloxera attacks and fungal diseases. Since one of the parents, Ehrenfelser, was named after a fortress on the Rhine, Burg Ehrenfels, Ehrenbreitsteiner was named after another one with a similar name, Ehrenbreitstein Fortress, which also combines the names of the two parents Ehrenfelser and Reichestiner. The fortress itself has no connection to viticulture. Ehrenbreitsteiner gives high crops due to a reliable fruit set, and is adaptable to many different soil types. Wines from Ehrenbreitsteiner are aromatic and high in acidity, and somewhat similar to those of Riesling. Small amounts of Ehrenbreitsteiner are cultivated in Germany, Canada, Austria, Hungary and Italy, but the variety is not of major importance in any wine region."
"Mondeuse blanche is a variety of white grape almost exclusively found in and around the Savoy (Savoie) wine region in France. With just 5 hectares (12 acres) of plantations in 1999, it leads a dwindling existence and is used primarily in the VDQS wine Bugey and the AOC Vin de Savoie."
"Arnsburger is a white variety of grape used for wine. It was created 1939 by Heinrich Birk (1898-1973) at the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute by crossing two clones of Riesling, clone 88 and clone 64. Arnsburger did not receive varietal protection until 1984. It was named after Arnsburg Abbey, a ruin of a Cistercian abbey in Wetterau, as a homage of the importance of Cistercians in the history of German wine. Plantations of Arnsburger is very small. Other than in Germany, small plantation on Madeira, in Italy and on New Zealand are known. Arnsburger has low susceptibility to gray rot, a fruitiness similar to Riesling. It gives higher yields than Müller-Thurgau but lower must weights. The only synonym of Arnsburger is its breeding code Geisenheim 22- 74. Arnsburg was used as a crossing partner for ."
"Freisamer is a white German wine grape variety grown primarily in the Baden region with some plantings in eastern and western Switzerland. The variety was created in 1916 by Karl Müller at the Staatliches Weinbauinstitut in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany by crossing Pinot gris and Silvaner. The purpose of the crossing was to find an improved variety similar to Pinot gris. The name is a contraction of Freiburg and Dreisam, the river that runs through Freiburg. Freisamer is primarily used to make full bodied sweet wines. In 2008, there were only 4 hectares (9.9 acres) of Freisamer plantations in Germany, most of which were in Baden."
"Madeleine Angevine is a white wine grape from the Loire Valley in France that is also popular in Germany, Kyrgyzstan and Washington state. The early-ripening grape is a cross between Madeleine Royale and Précoce de Malingre grapes that grows well in cooler climates. Madeleine Angevine makes an attractive fruity wine with a flowery nose, similar to an Alsatian Pinot blanc. It is crisp, acid and dry and pairs particularly well with seafoods such as crab and oyster. Madeleine Angevine was crossed with to make the and grapes. It was crossed with Traminer to make the grape. In Washington State, the grape has developed a cult following in the Puget Sound region for its floral character and easy-drinking nature."
Debina is a white Albanian & Greek wine grape primarily in the Përmet region in Albania and Zitsa region of Epirus. The grape's high acidity lends itself to sparkling wine production.
"Zéta is a Hungarian wine grape, a crossing of Furmint and Bouvier. It was introduced to the Tokaj-Hegyalja wine region of Hungary in 1951 and authorized for production in 1990. Previously known as Oremus, its name was changed to Zéta in 1999. Its main asset is a particular aptitude for high sugar concentrations, early ripening and susceptibility for botrytis. As Oremus, it was used in the production of Tokaji wines."
"Ezerjó is a white Hungarian wine grape grown primarily in the Mór region. Locally it is prized for its very fruity nose and crisp, full-bodied freshness. It is rare to find a bottle outside of Hungary as most is consumed by the local population and production is limited to certain small areas. This wine has a very long history including being a favorite with the royals of the Habsburg dynasty. It is also used to make sweet dessert wines."
Bianca is a white Hungarian wine grape variety that was developed in 1963 in the Eger wine region of northeast Hungary. The grape is a hybrid crossing of Bouvier and (an offspring of Villard blanc). The grape was officially register for use in wine production in 1982 and today is used to make a wide assortment of wines from dry varietals to sweet dessert wines. Bianca is growing in popularity among organic vineyards due to its natural high resistance to many fungal diseases that affect grapevines.
"Falanghina, also called Falanghina Greco, is a variety of wine grape, Vitis vinifera, used for white wines. It is an ancient grape variety which may have provided a basis for the classical Falernian wine, and has considerable character. It is cultivated on the coast of Campania north of Naples, and frequently consumed in southern Italy along with seafood. The name for the wine appears to derive from the Latin falangae, or stakes for supporting the grapes in a vineyard. In November 2014 Falanghina was approved as a recognized varietal by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau for use in the United States."
"Verduzzo (or Verduzzo Friulano) is a white Italian wine grape grown predominantly in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region of northeast Italy. It is also found in significant plantings in the Piave Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) of the Veneto region, though some of these plantings may be of the separate Verduzzo Trevigiano variety. Verduzzo Friulano is used in varietal and blended wines, many of which fall under DOC as well as vino da tavola designations, that range in style from dry to late harvest wines. According to wine expert Oz Clarke, most of the sweeter examples of Verduzzo can be found in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia with the grape being used for progressively drier styles of the wine the further west into the Veneto. The grape is widely associated with the Denominazione di origine controllata e Garantita (DOCG) wine of Ramandolo which gained DOCG status in 2001. It is also often seen in the DOC wines from the Colli Orientali del Friuli. Wine expert Karen MacNeil has stated that the Verduzzo-based Ramandolo is one of the ""lightest-bodied, most exquisite dessert wines made anywhere"". According to wine writers Joe Bastianich and David Lynch, Verduzzo has the potential to produce honeyed sweet wines with a citrus note similar to ""an orange jelly candy"" as well as somewhat tannic dry whites with ""chalky"" notes."
"Escanyavella is a white Catalan wine grape variety planted primarily in DOQ Priorat. The name literally translates from Catalan as ""old lady strangler"" and coughing is often a common reaction to those who eat the raw grapes. While grown in small numbers in Priorat, there are a number of wineries that use it as part of their blends and one that makes a wine completely from the grape although. It is a thick skinned grape with high acidity and is harvested later than other white varieties. Despite not being an officially recommended grape for DOQ Priorat wine certification, there has been an effort recently by several cellars in the region to recuperate and revitalize this nearly lost grape."
"Doradillo is a white wine grape grown primarily in the Riverland region of South Australia. It originates from Spain, and is also known as Blanquette of South Australia. Doradillo is also used as a synonym for the grape varieties Jaén Blanco and Doradilla, but Doradilla is also a distinct variety."
"Rotgipfler is a grape variety used to make aromatic white wine. It is almost exclusively found in the Gumpoldskirchen district of the Thermenregion in Austria. It is often blended with Zierfandler (which is also known as Spätrot) to make Spätrot-Rotgipfler. It is also increasingly used for quality wines. Such Rotgipfler wines are powerful, high in alcohol and suitable for cellaring. In 1999 there were 118.42 hectares (292.6 acres) of Rotgipfler vineyards in Austria. Rotgipfler has been named for the red tips of its vine leaves. The earliest known mention of Rotgipfler was in 1837 in Steiermark by Johann Burger. Rotgipfler has been identified as a cross between Traminer and Roter Veltliner."
Roter Veltliner is a grape variety used to make white wine. It is found in Austria. Some of the better wines come from the Wagram district of .
Goldburger is a white Austrian wine grape grown primarily in the Burgenland region. The grape is a crossing of Orangetraube and Welschriesling and was created in 1922 by Fritz Zweigelt at the Höhere Bundeslehranstalt und Bundesamt für Wein- und Obstbau (HBLAuBA) in Klosterneuburg.
"Molette is a white French wine grape planted primarily in the Savoie region. As a varietal wine, Molette tends to produce neutral tasting wine so it is often blended with Roussette to add more complexity. DNA analysis has revealed Molette to be a cross between Gouais blanc and an unidentified grape variety."
Trousseau Gris is a French grape variety made into white wine. It is occasionally found in eastern France and was once widely grown in California under the name Gray Riesling. In cool climates it can produce fresh aromatic wines. It needs gentle handling and careful winemaking to bring out its best. It is a white mutation of the red Trousseau grape.
"Tsolikouri (Georgian: ცოლიკოური) is a light yellow-skinned white grape variety grown mainly in western Imereti district of Georgia. It cultivated in Kolkhida Lowland at an altitude of 160 m (520 ft) above sea level. Out of 400 different types of grapes in the country, Tsolikouri is among the most widespread varieties. Nearly 90% of vineyards in western Georgia grow Tsolikauri. This sort usually matures by mid October. Grown in Orzhonikidze vineyards during Soviet rule of Georgia, Tsolikouri was considered one of high-quality grapes along with and Izabella varieties. It has been used for production of premium dry, semi-sweet and semi-dry wines.Tsolikauri, Kolkheti, Lelo, Tvishi wines are made from Tsolikouri grapes. According to former Soviet statesman Vyacheslav Molotov, Tsolikouri was one of favorite wines of Soviet leader, Joseph Stalin."
"Rkatsiteli (/rəˌkɑːtsɪˈtɛli/; Georgian რქაწითელი rkats’iteli; literally ""red stem"" or ""red horned"") is a kind of grape used to produce white wine."
"Mtsvane or Mtsvane Kakhuri is a grape variety used to make Georgian wines. It is used to make white wine. It was so named to refer to the yellowish-green colouring of the ripened berries. It is often blended with Rkatsiteli to create a fruity, aromatic wine. In the Georgian language the word mtsvane means new, young and green."
"Kanzler is a white German wine grape variety that was produced in the city of Alzey as a crossing of Müller-Thurgau and Silvaner. Today it is primarily grown in the Rheinhessen where it is valued for the high must weights that the grapes can achieve. However, the grape is very sensitive to terroir and vineyard site selection with a tendency to produce very low yields in unfavorable locations."
"Arinto or Arinto de Bucelas is a white Portuguese wine grape planted primarily in the Bucelas, Tejo and Vinho Verde regions. It can produce high acid wines with lemon notes."
Encruzado is a white Portuguese wine grape grown primarily in the Dão DOC. It is mainly used as a blending grape. It is also known as Salgueirinho.
"Savagnin Rose or Roter Traminer is a variety of wine grape. It has a pink, reddish or brownish red skin colour, but is counted as a ""white wine grape"" since it does not have the deep purple/blue/black colour of ""red wine grapes"". Savagnin Rose is a member of the Traminer family of grapes, and as such is related to both Savagnin Blanc and Gewürztraminer. It has a different skin colour than Savagnin Blanc, and does not have the aromatic properties of the much more common Gewürztraminer, which is a musqué mutation of Savagnin Rose, or of a similar red-skinned Traminer variety. Savagnin Rose is now relatively rare in cultivation, and primarily found only in pure plantation and varietal wines in Alsace, where the designation Klevener de Heiligenstein denotes a wine produced from Savagnin Rose. It is also likely that a proportion of non-Musqué red Traminer exists side by side with Musque red Traminer/Gewürztraminer in older vineyards of Germany and Austria. The vines of the Savagnin Rose variety planted in Alsace bear striking similarities, morphologically, to Gewürztraminer vines and are almost indistinguishable on inspection. Outside of DNA testing and analysis of the wine that both grapes produce, the only noticeable difference is that just prior to veraison the grapes of Savagnin Rose turn almost translucent while the skins of Gewürztraminer grapes are more opaque. The most obvious way to distinguish the two was to compare the type of wines that each produces with Gewürztraminer wine being much more aromatic. Until the 1970s, winemakers would label wines of better quality ""Gewürztraminer"" and wines of lesser quality ""Traminer"" or ""Klevener de Heiligenstein"", regardless of the final composition of Gewürztraminer, Savagnin Rose and/or Traminer in the wine. In 1973, the names Traminer and Savagnin Rose was discontinued from use on Alsatian wine labels. Due to the significant plantings of Savagnin Rose in Heiligenstein and the villages around it, the wine style of ""Klevener de Heiligenstein"" was granted a grace period for use of that name."
"Arrufiac (or Arrufiat) is a white French wine grape variety that is primarily planted in the Gascony region of South West France. It is a secondary grape in the wines from the Pacherenc du Vic-Bilh Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC). While the grape has had a long history being blended with Petit Courbu in Gascon wines, it has only recently experienced a resurgence of interest in the late 20th century following the release of white blends from of , one of the region's largest , in the 1980s."
"Vespaiola is a white Italian wine grape variety planted primarily in the Veneto region of northeastern Italy, where it is often dried to produce passito style dessert wines. Along with Friulano, Vespaiola is an important component in the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) white wine of Breganze produced in the province of Vicenza. Vespaiola grapes ripen to high sugar levels and are used to produce sweet wines with a characteristic golden hue. In fact, the grapes of Vespaiola get so concentrated with sugars that the name Vespaiola comes from Vespa, in reference to wasps that are attracted to the sugary aromas in vineyards. Despite its similar-sounding name, Vespaiola should not be confused with red Italian wine grape, Vespolina, which is grown in the Piedmont and Lombardy regions."
"Juwel is a white German wine grape variety that was produced in the mid-20th century as a crossing between Kerner and Silvaner. By the end of the 20th century, only around 30 hectares of the grapes were still in production, mostly found in the Rheinhessen."
"Montepila is a white Spanish wine grape. It is one of the authorized varieties in the Montilla-Moriles Denominación de Origen (DO), in Andalusia, Spain. Montepila is not known under any other synonyms."
"Österreichisch-Weiß (literally, Austrian white) is a grape variety for white wine. It is now very rarely cultivated, but is noted for being one of the parents of Silvaner, the other parent being Traminer. Österreichisch-Weiß itself is the offspring of Weißer Heunisch (Gouais blanc) as father with an unknown mother variety. In older times, Österreichisch-Weiß (up to 90%) blended with Traminer contributed to giving ""Grinzinger"" (wine from Grinzing in Vienna) a good reputation. It is often confused with . The name Österreicher has previously also been used as a synonym for Brauner Veltliner and Silvaner."
Roublot is a traditional French variety of white wine grape that is a sibling of Chardonnay. It was once quite widely grown near Auxerre.
"Orléans is a variety of white grape (sp. Vitis vinifera) which up until the 19th century was much grown in Germany, but in very little use since the early 20th century. It has large berries with thick skins and a high yield. Young Orléans wine has been described as somewhat reminiscent of wine made from white varieties of the pinot family, but with pineapple aromas."
"Albana is a white Italian wine grape planted primarily in the Emilia-Romagna region. The wine made from the grape, Albana di Romagna, was first awarded DOCG status (Denominazione Origine Controllata e Garantita) in 1987. The grape produces deeply colored wines and could be related to Greco di Tufo."
"Durella or Durello is a white Italian wine grape variety originating from the Veneto wine region of northeast Italy. Today it is sparsely cultivated, though some producers like to experiment with it since its high acid levels makes it suitable for sparkling wines. The white Veneto wine grape Bianchetta Trevigiana is believed to be the result of a natural crossing between Durella and the nearly extinct red wine grape ."
"Barbera bianca is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Piedmont wine region of northwest Italy. Despite being named Barbera bianca, the grape is not a color mutation of the red Piedmontese wine grape Barbera that is the third most widely planted grape variety in Italy. In fact, DNA analysis conducted in the early 21st century shows no genetic relationship at all between the two grape varieties. Barbera bianca is noted for its high acidity levels, the vast majority of it tartaric rather than malic acid. This propensity for high acid lends the grape well to sparkling wine production. Barbera bianca is a permitted grape variety in the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) wines of produced in the province of Alessandria."
"Azal branco is a white Portuguese wine grape planted primarily in the Minho region but with greater expansion to Amarante, Basto, Baião and Vale do Sousa sub-regions. It noted for the high acidity of its wines, and is used for white Vinho Verde. Varietal Azal Branco wines can be somewhat reminiscent of Riesling. Total Portuguese plantations are around 5,100 hectares (13,000 acres), which makes it the second-most planted grape variety of Minho, after Loureiro. The Azal variety provides an intense green color when maturated and an aroma of citric fruits (such as lemon or green apple) and nuts. It produces young, fresh yet acidic wines."
Avesso is a white Portuguese wine grape planted primarily in the Minho region of Portugal. It can make full-bodied aromatic wines. Ampelographers believe it may be related to the Portuguese grape Jaen.
"Gutenborner is a white German wine grape that is also used in English wine production. The grape was created in 1928 by Heinrich Birk at Forschungsanstalt Geisenheim by crossing of Müller-Thurgau and (also known as Chasselas Napoleon). The only synonym of Gutenborner is its breeding code, Geisenheim 17–52."
"Roussanne is a white wine grape grown originally in the Rhône wine region in France, where it is often blended with Marsanne. It is the only other white variety, besides Marsanne, allowed in the northern Rhône appellations of Crozes-Hermitage AOC, Hermitage AOC and Saint-Joseph AOC. In the southern Rhône appellation of Châteauneuf-du-Pape AOC it is one of six white grapes allowed, where it may be blended into red wines. Roussanne is also planted in various wine-growing regions of the New World, such as California, Washington, Texas, South Africa and Australia as well as European regions such as Crete, Tuscany and Spain. The berries are distinguished by their russet color when ripe—roux is French for the reddish-brown color russet, and is probably the root for the variety's name. The aroma of Roussanne is often reminiscent of a flowery herbal tea. In warm climates, it produces wines of richness, with flavors of honey and pear, and full body. In cooler climates it is more floral and more delicate, with higher acidity. In many regions, it is a difficult variety to grow, with vulnerability to mildew, poor resistance to drought and wind, late and/or uneven ripening, and irregular yields."
"Räuschling is a white variety of grape used for wine. It is today almost only found in small amounts in German-speaking parts of Switzerland, where Räuschling can produce fruity, crisp white wines with good acidity. Räuschling has previously been much more common in Switzerland, Germany and Alsace. Before the widespread planting of Müller-Thurgau, Räuschling and Elbling were the most common grape varieties in Switzerland. German plantations were found in Franconia, Palatinate and Württemberg, as well as in Baden in medieval times. It is also thought to have been the grape variety of the early wines traded from Tramin, with Großer Traminer being one of its synonyms. The name of the variety is supposed to derive from the robust leaf canopy of Räuschling vines which make noise - ""rauschen"" in German - in strong wind. However, the name Reuschling first appeared in the vineyard ordnance (Weingartordnung) issued in 1614 by Count . In the herbals written by Hieronymus Bock in the 16th century, it is referred to as Drutsch or Drutscht. The name Großer Räuschling has been used to differentiate it from the variety Knipperlé, which was previously common in Alsace and which is also called Kleiner Räuschling. Räuschling and Knipperlé are thought to be closely related. DNA profiling has revealed Räuschling to be a cross between Gouais blanc (Weißer Heunisch) and a vine of the Pinot family."
"Reichensteiner is a white wine grape that is mainly grown in Germany (106 hectares (260 acres) (2008 fig.)), England (85.38 hectares (211.0 acres) (2010 fig.)), and New Zealand (72 hectares (180 acres) (2009 fig.)). It is a cross between Müller-Thurgau and Madeleine Angevine x , and was first bred in Germany during 1939. In England, it is the 5th most grown variety after Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Bacchus, and Seyval blanc (2010 fig.). It is quite high in sugars, so is suited to cooler climates, and is suitable for making both sparkling and still wines, but often needs blending with other varieties as it does not add much flavor. It has been used to breed Garanoir (Gamay noir x Reichensteiner) and Ehrenbreitsteiner."
"Green Hungarian, Butschera (Hungarian) or Putzscheere (German) is a white Hungarian wine grape. It is also found in California, but in recent years the grape has been declining in number of plantings. The grape variety is likely to have originated from the border area between Hungary and Romania, or the Carpathians. In former times, it was much cultivated in much of central and eastern Europe as a high-yielding grape for simple wines, which has resulted that it is known under a large number of synonyms in different languages. It was also used as a table grape. Today, very little of it remains in cultivation in Europe."
"Chasan is a white French wine grape variety grown primarily in the Languedoc wine region. According to the Vitis International Variety Catalogue, the variety is a crossing of Listan and Pinot. However, some sources (such as wine experts Jancis Robinson and Oz Clarke) describe the grape as a crossing between Listan and Chardonnay. All sources agree, however, that the variety was created in 1958 by at the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA) - Unité Expérimentale du Domaine de Vassal & Montpellier SupAgro. One possible source for the confusion of the grapes parentage is that a common synonym of several clones of Chardonnay are sometimes listed as Pinot Chardonnay and Chardonnay, itself, was a crossing of Pinot and the obscure French wine grape Gouais blanc."
"Pigato is a white Italian wine grape planted primarily in Liguria. The grape is found in the Riviera di Ponente zone in Italy's region of Liguria which makes sturdy, aromatic wines with plenty of fruit. DNA evidence proves that Pigato, Vermentino and Favorita are the same variety.It gains its name, which means ""spotted"" from the appearance of the ripe grapes."
"Muscat Rouge à Petits Grains is a wine grape for white wine that is a member of the Muscat family of Vitis vinifera. Its name comes from its characteristic small berry size and tight clusters, and from its skin colour. It's a variation of the more common Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains with a reddish colour, which in some of its synonyms are described as brown, gray or violet. Muscat Rose à Petits Grains is a further variation with lighter, pinkish skin colour. It originates from Greece."
"Tourbat is a white grape variety planted primarily in the French wine region of the Côtes du Roussillon AOC where is sometimes called Malvoisie du Roussillon. It is also found in the Italian wines from Sardinia where the grape is known as Torbato and in the Aragon region of Spain. As a varietal, Tourbat is known for its smokey notes."
"Jacquère is a variety of white grape found primarily in the Savoy wine region of France. It is a high-yielding vine variety which is used to produce lightly scented, refreshing and gently aromatic dry white wine, such as Vin de Savoie. Jacquère is the grape used in Apremont wines and is the usual wine paired with cheese fondue (a dish from the same region). It is also found in Bugey wines. Furthermore, Jacquère has been grown in some Condrieu vineyards, but it is officially not allowed to be used in Condrieu Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée wine. After increased plantings in the 1980s, it has remained at a level of about 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres) in France since the 1990s."
"Perle is a white German wine grape planted primarily in Franconia. The grape is a crossing of Gewürztraminer and Müller-Thurgau. As a varietal, Perle produces highly aromatic wines."
"Burger is a white wine grape of French origin, today planted primarily in the Central Valley. Its French name is Monbadon. In the early history of Californian wine, Burger was a majority variety but its influence has steadily decreased and now it is used primarily in bulk jug wine production."
"Sacy is a white wine grape grown primarily in the central and northeastern France within the Yonne and Allier départments. Sacy ripens early, and produces light-coloured wines low in acid and alcohol."
"Arbois or Arbois Blanc is a white French wine grape variety planted primarily in the Loire regions. Despite being a minor grape, in the late 20th century it was the third most widely planted grape variety in the Loir-et-Cher département which includes the winemaking areas of Cheverny, Cour-Cheverny, Montrichard, Oisly, Saint-Romain-sur-Cher, Valençay as well as vineyards that make wines under the Touraine AOC, and Vin de Pays du Loir et Cher. By 2004 acreage had steadily declined to around 750 acres (300 hectares). It is still a permitted grape variety in the Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) regions of Cheverny AOC, Valençay AOC and Vouvray AOC."
"Neuburger is a white Austrian wine grape. The grape is a crossing of Roter Veltliner and Sylvaner. As varietal, it generally produces full bodied wines."
"Humagne Blanche or Humagne is a white Swiss wine grape planted primarily in the Valais region. The total Swiss plantations of the variety in 2009 stood at 30 hectares (74 acres). The grape produces a full bodied wine that is richer than Amigne and Petite Arvine, but more neutral in flavour than the latter. DNA profiling at Changins in Switzerland and Aosta in Italy established that Humagne Blanche is not related to the red Swiss variety Humagne Rouge."
Completer or Malanstraube is a white Swiss wine grape variety grown primarily in eastern Switzerland around Graubünden. The Completer vine was once domesticated but has now become mostly feral though some Swiss winemakers will make limited quantities of wine harvested from the wild vines. Wine produced from Completer tends to be very full bodied and aromatic.
Verdesse is a white French wine grape variety grown primarily in the Bugey AOC of eastern France (though it is not currently permitted in the AOC wine). It is also permitted under the Vin de Savoie AOC for wines produced in the Isère department up to a maximum allowance of 10%. Ampelographers believe that the variety is likely very old and originated along the Drac and Grésivaudan valleys in Isère.
"Maceratino is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown predominantly in the Marche along the Adriatic coast of Italy. Ampelographers believe the grape may have some relation to Greco and Verdicchio, as evidence by the several overlapping synonyms, but no definitive link has been proven. For most of the 20th century, and into the 21st century, plantings of Maceratino have been declining and becoming increasingly rare. White wines from Colli Maceratesi DOC must use at least 80 per cent Maceratino in the blend."
"Favorita is a white Italian wine grape grown primarily in the Piedmont region. It is most widely planted on the left bank of the Tanaro river in the Roero district near Alba, though some plantings exist on the right bank of the Tanaro in the Langhe hills. Recent DNA profiling shows that Favorita is related to the Liguria grapes Pigato and Vermentino, which may support the theory that the grape originated there. Since the late 20th century, plantings of Favorita have been on the decline as Chardonnay and Arneis have increased in popularity among producers on the right and left bank of the Tanaro respectively. Featuring larger berry sizes than most wine grapes, Favorita has been a popular table grape in Piedmont."
Crouchen is a white South African and Australian wine grape variety that originated in the western Pyrenees of France but is now virtually extinct in France due to its high susceptibility to fungal diseases like powdery and downy mildew. The grape is known under a wide variety of synonyms including Clare Riesling and Cape Riesling though it is not related to the well known international variety Riesling. Recent European Union regulation aimed at standardizing wine labelling laws has encouraged wineries to move away from these synonyms but their use still persists.
"Rieslaner is a breed cross of the Silvaner and Riesling grape that was first bred in Veitshöcheim, Franconia, Germany in 1921 by the grape breeder August Ziegler. It is a late ripening grape that is fairly high in acidity. Today it is mostly grown in the Franconia (Franken) region and in the Palatinate (Pfalz) region where the grape is often affected by botrytis. Rieslaner is bred to do well with botrytis, and it holds a lot of potential to form an acidic, fruity, and full yield when it is ripened."
"Fernão Pires is a white Portuguese wine grape grown throughout Portugal, especially in the Tejo and Bairrada, where it is also known as ""Maria Gomes"". This variety is known to produce wines with a spicy aromatic character, though often with delicate exotic fruity notes. Generally not expected to be a long-living wine, this wine is best drunk in its infancy or matured for up to 2 or 3 years. Outside of Portugal there are some significant plantings in South Africa."
"Fiano is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown primarily in the Campania region of southern Italy and on the island of Sicily. In Campania, this fairly strong flavored white wine grape is particularly noted around Avellino where the Denominazione di origine controllata e Garantita (DOCG) wine of Fiano di Avellino is produced. The grape has a long history in the Campanian region and is believed to have been the grape behind the ancient Roman wine Apianum. Even today, the name Apianum is permitted to appear on wine labels of the DOCG wine Fiano di Avellino. Outside of Italy, several Australian wine producers have begun to use the grape. Production seems to be increasing, although the number of vineyards growing it is still small. One place of production is in the McLaren Vale wine region of South Australia and in the Hunter Valley wine region of New South Wales. More recently, some winemakers in Argentina are producing Fiano in the La Rioja district, north of Mendoza. Beyond its strong flavors and intense aroma notes, the Fiano grapevine is noted viticulturally for the relatively low yields it produces."
Cortese is a white Italian wine grape variety predominantly grown in the southeastern regions of Piedmont in the provinces of Alessandria and Asti. It is the primary grape of the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) wines of Cortese dell'Alto Monferrato and Colli Tortonesi as well as the Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) wine of Cortese di Gavi. Significant plantings of Cortese can also be found in the Lombardy region of Oltrepò Pavese and in the DOC white blends of the Veneto wine region of Bianco di Custoza. Cortese has a long history in Italian viticulture with written documentation naming the grape among the plantings in a Piedmontese vineyard as early as 1659. The grape's moderate acidity and light flavors has made it a favorite for the restaurants in nearby Genoa as a wine pairing with the local seafood caught off the Ligurian coast.
"Addoraca is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Calabria region of southern Italy where it is blended with Coda di Volpe bianca, and Muscat blanc à Petits Grains in the passito dessert wine Moscato di Saracena."
"Verduzzo Trevigiano is a white Venetian grape variety that is grown in the Eastern Veneto wine area (northeast of Italy). In the past the name Verduz referred to a wide range of grape varieties in the Venetian area. By the descriptions found, they were often morphologically very different, but shared the character of late ripening. However we can very frequently find the name Verduzzo in the ampelographic list of the 19th century, there is not any sign of this Verduzzo until the beginning of the 20th century. At that time just two varieties, with the same name Verduzzo, were still coltivated in the Veneto and Friuli area, they were what we today call Verduzzo Friulano and Verduzzo Trevigiano. The two varieties are clearly different, as demonstrated even with DNA profiling analyses in 2010 and 2011.However at the beginning of the 20th century, the two Verduzzo were called with the same name and often were present in the same vineyard and made wine together. Cosmo proposed to call the two varieties with different names: Verduzzo friulano for the varieties typical of Ramandolo production that was the only one present in that area of Friuli, and Verduzzo Trevigiano for the other one, that was present in the oriental zone of Veneto, where even Verduzzo friulano was spread, but which has a sure origin in the Treviso province how showed by the papers of Lepido Rocco."
"Forastera is a white Spanish wine grape variety that is primarily grown in the Canary Islands. While it may have historically been used in sack production, now it is mostly a minor blending grape permitted in the Denominaciones de Origens (DOs) of the Canary Islands."
Pardillo is a white Spanish wine grape planted primarily in western Spain. Varietal wines made from Pardillo are neutral flavored.
"Caíño blanco or Cainho branco is a white Spanish and Portuguese wine grape variety that is grown in northwest Spain and northern Portugal in a stretch of area between Vinho Verde and the Denominación de Origen (DO) of Rías Baixas. The grape is often confused for Albariño and in Vinho Verde it is sometimes known under the name Alvarinhão (a synonym shared with another Portuguese grape, Fernão Pires). While DNA profiling conducted in the early 21st century has shown that the two grapes are distinct varieties, the evidence has suggested that Caíño blanco maybe an offspring of Albariño from a natural crossing with the red Portuguese wine grape Azal tinto (also known as Caíño Bravo)."
Giró blanc is a pink-skinned Spanish wine grape variety grown in the Balearic islands where it used in white wines produced under the Illes Balears appellation. Ampelographers believe that the grape is indigenous to Majorca with DNA profiling showing no known relationship to the Sardinian wine grape Girò or to Grenache which is known as Girò (without the blanc designation) on Majorca. Today the grape is almost exclusively found on the island of Majorca with 6 hectares (15 acres) in cultivation in 2012.
"Pedro Giménez is a white Argentine wine grape that is rapidly declining in plantings. Despite the similar name, the Spanish wine grape Pedro Ximénez is a different variety with ampelographers not yet certain if the two grapes are in any way related. Grown predominantly in the Mendoza wine region, Pedro Giménez makes simple wines similar to those made from Cereza and Criolla Grande. It is also grown in Bolivia, where it is made into single varietal wine at the Uvairenda winery in Samaipata. There are some plantings in Chile where it is a minor grape in pisco production."
"Albalonga is a white German wine grape variety that is a crossing between Rieslaner and Müller-Thurgau. It is grown primarily in the Rheinhessen where, in favorable vintages, it can produce wines up to auslese-level sweetness. However, the variety is prone to various grape rots which can make viticulture difficult for the variety."
Nobling is a white German wine grape variety that is a crossing between Silvaner and Chasselas. The variety was created in 1940 at the in Baden-Württemberg by grape breeder Johannes Zimmermann. It is primarily found in the Baden wine region but its number have been declining for most of the late 20th and early 21st century from its high point of 100 hectares (250 acres) in the late 1970s.
"Arvesiniadu or Arvisionadu is a rare native white Italian wine grape variety that is grown on the island of Sardinia. It is usually used in blends but can also be made into sweet or dry varietal style wines under the Indicazione geografica tipica (IGT) designation of Isola dei Nuraghi. The research project ""AKINAS - Unique vines from the biodiversity of Sardinia"" defines Arvisionadu as a ""Unicum"", a term used to define those vines for which no genetic correspondence has been found."
"Coda di Pecora is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Campania region of southern Italy, particularly in the province of Caserta. The name Coda di Pecora means ""goat's tail"" in the local dialect and for many years was thought to be a clonal variation of another white Campanian variety, Coda di Volpe, whose name means ""foxtail""."
"Vernaccia di Oristano is a white Italian wine grape variety grown on the island of Sardinia which makes a wide range of wine styles for the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) of Vernaccia di Oristano based in the province of Oristano. This includes both dry and sweet wines as well as fortified ""sherry-like"" wines aged in a solera. The grape has a long history on the island of Sardinia with Sardinians claiming that consuming ample quantities of wine produced from the grape as being responsible for low instances of malaria on the island. Despite the similarities in their names and synonyms, Vernaccia di Oristano is a distinct variety that is not related to the Tuscan wine grape Vernaccia used to make Vernaccia di San Gimignano. The grape also does not appear to be related to the red wine grapes Aleatico or Grenache which are known as Vernaccia in different parts of Italy."
"Vital is a white Portuguese wine grape variety that is grown primarily in Western Portugal. Sometimes known under the synonym Malvasia Corado, the variety tends to produce rather neutral flavor wine with low acidity unless the grape is grown in vineyards of high altitude. Another common synonym in the Lisboa VR of the former Estremadura Province is Malvasia Fina though ampelographers are not sure if Vital is related to the Malvasia grown widely in Italy, Greece and throughout Europe. One key difference that ampelographers note is that the shape of the leaves of Vital and the various Malvasia species tend to be very different. Even in the Douro DOC there is a Malvasia Fina used in Port wine production that may or may not be the same variety as Vital."
Würzer is a white German wine grape variety that is a crossing of Gewürztraminer and Müller-Thurgau. The variety was bred at a German viticultural research station in the town of Alzey in 1932 but wasn't commercially planted on a significant scale until the 1980s. Today there are a little over 100 hectares (250 acres) of the variety planted mostly in the Rheinhessen. The grape has a reputation among growers for being a consistent producer with good yields.
"Terrantez (also known as Cascal) is a white Portuguese wine grape variety that was once widely used on the island of Madeira to make the sweet fortified wine for which the island is known. Today, the variety is nearly extinct on the island. There are still some limited plantings in the Minho Province where, as Cascal, is a permitted blending variety with Alvarinho and other grapes in the Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) wine Vinho Verde. As Terrantez the grape is permitted in several of the Indicação de Proveniencia Regulamentada (IPR) regions of the Azores including Biscoitos IPR on Terceira Island, Graciosa IPR on the white island of Graciosa and Pico IPR on Pico Island."
"Moscato Giallo or Yellow Muscat is a white Italian wine grape variety that is a member of the Muscat family of grapes. Known for its large deep cluster of loose, deep-yellow berries and golden colored wine, Moscato Giallo is grown mostly in northern Italy where it is most often used to produce passito style dessert wines. The grape is also planted in Croatia where it is known as Muškat žuti."
Claverie is a white French wine grape variety that was once widely planted in the Landes region by Dutch traders who prized the varieties ability to produce wines with high alcohol levels. Today the variety exist in small isolated plantings in Southwest France and is nearing extinction.
"Taminga is white Australian wine grape variety that was developed in the late 20th century by viticulturalist and grape breeder at CSIRO. It is a cross of a previously created crossing and the Vitis vinifera variety Traminer Rot (Gewürztraminer) Like Tarrango, a 1960s crossing between Touriga Nacional and Sultana, Taminga was bred to maintain high acidity levels while growing in hot Australian vinyards. Early results from Taminga show that it can ripen consistently in different vineyard location and produce wines that wine expert Jancis Robinson describes as ""commercially acceptable."
"Brustiano bianco is a white French wine grape variety from the island of Corsica. The grape was thought to be extinct until DNA testing of vines on nearby Sardinia led to the discovery that the Licronaxu bianco and its color mutation grapevine Licronaxu nero were in fact Brustiano bianco. This discovery has allowed for the grape to be reintroduce to Corsica where it is often blended with Vermentino, and ."
"Besgano bianco is a white Italian wine grape variety that was historically used in the production of the dessert wine Vin Santo, blended with Malvasia Bianca Lunga and Verdea, but today is rarely planted and is more often used for table grape production than winemaking. The grape is also known as Colombana bianca but it is not a color mutation of the Tuscan and Emilia-Romagna wine grape Colombana nera."
Biancone di Portoferraio is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown almost exclusively on the island of Elba off the coast of Tuscany. Some ampelographers have speculated that the grape may have originated on the French island of Corsica where the grape shares a close genetic relationship with the Corsican wine grape (also known as just Biancone).
"Arilla is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown on the island of Ischia in the Tyrrhenian Sea near the Gulf of Naples. However, despite being exclusively found on the island, ampelographers believe that the grape may have actually originated in Sicily. Today, Arilla is noted for its very high yields of grapes that produces relatively neutral tasting wine that is often blended with other local Italian grape varieties such as Biancolella, Forastera and ."
"Terret blanc is a white French wine grape variety growing primarily in the Languedoc-Roussillon region of southern France. It is a mutation of the Terret vine that also spawned the dark skinned Terret noir and light-skinned Terret gris varieties. In official statistics, the plantings of two ""light-berried"" Terret grapes (Blanc and Gris) are often counted together. The varieties reached their peak in French wine productions in the late 1980s when together the Terret varieties were the ninth most widely planted white grape variety. In the Languedoc, plantings of Terret were equal to that of Chardonnay."
"Weldra is a white South African wine grape variety that is a crossing of Chenin blanc and Trebbiano. According to wine expert Jancis Robinson, Weldra can maintain good acidity levels through ripening but tends to produce rather neutral tasting wines."
"Rovello bianco or Greco Muscio is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Campania region of southern Italy. While the grape has been described in wine literature since 1875, the variety was on the verge of extinction until a collaboration by the University of Naples Federico II and University of Palermo along with a local wine grower in Taurasi help revive the variety with new plantings in 2003."
The Diamond grape is a white grape which is a cross between the Concord and grapes. It was developed in the 1880s in New York. It is used today in table wines and grape juice.
"Regner is a white German wine grape variety that is a crossing of the table grape Seidentraube (also known as Luglienga bianca) and the Vitis vinifera red grape variety Gamay. The variety was developed in 1929 and by 1990 there was almost 420 acres (170 hectares) of Regner planted in Germany, mostly in the Rheinhessen. By the late 20th century, wine growers in England were also experimenting with the variety."
Albanella is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Marche region where it is a primary component in the white Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) wines of . The grape is often confused with the similarly named grape Albanello and was long thought to be identical to the Tuscan wine grape Trebbiano but has established through DNA analysis to be its own distinct variety.
"Caprettone is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Campania region of southern Italy where it is a minor blending component in the Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) wine of Lacryma Christi bianco. Caprettone is also grown in the Rogue River Valley of southern Oregon. Historically, the grape was believed to be a clone of the Campanian grape Coda di Volpe but DNA analysis has shown that the two grapes are instead distinct varieties."
"Coda di Volpe is a white Italian wine grape variety that has been historically grown in the Campania region around the town of Naples. It is often confused with another white Italian wine grape, , that share many of the same synonyms as Coda di Volpe."
"Blatterle is a white Italian wine grape variety from the Alto-Adige of northeast Italy. The grape, which was historically grown around the commune of Bolzano in South Tyrol and the Eisacktal valley, gets its name from the term in the local Tyrolese dialect for ""little leaves"". While not widely used in commercial wine production, the grape is sometimes blended with other local Tyrolese varieties, such as , and Müller-Thurgau."
Souvignier gris is a white German wine grape variety that was created in 1983 Dr. Norbert Becker by crossing the red French wine grape variety Cabernet Sauvignon with the white German grape crossing previously created by Becker known as Bronner. Bronner is a crossing of the hybrid varieties Merzling (mother vine) and Gm 6494 (father vine).
"Donzelinho branco is a white Portuguese wine grape variety that is classified as one of the ""Very Good"" varieties authorized to be used in Port wine production. While rarely seen as a varietal wine, Donzelinho branco is a permitted variety in the white blends of several northern Portuguese wine regions including the Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) of Douro and Trás-os-Montes and the Vinho Regional (VR) wines of Duriense and Transmontano."
"Graisse is a white French wine grape variety that is grown primarily in the Armagnac region of western France where the grape is used for both wine production and distillation. The pulp of the grape is characterized by its high viscosity levels, which can create some difficulties in winemaking, to produce a wine that expert Jancis Robinson describes as being of average to low quality. In recent years, plantings of Graisse have been steadily declining."
"Pascal blanc is a white French wine grape variety grown in the Provence region of southern France. While once more widely planted, this ancient Provençal variety is nearly extinct with only a few plantings left in the Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) region of Cassis and some hectares used for experimental vin de pays."
Viosinho is a white Portuguese wine grape variety that is grown primarily in northern Portugal where it attains high acidity levels. It is primarily found in the Trás-os-Montes and Douro DOCs. It is used primarily as a blending grape where it adds structures and flavor to both still and fortified Port wines.
"Bianco d'Alessano is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Apulia region of southern Italy, where it is often blended with Verdeca. In the early 21st century, the grape was planted in the South Australian wine region of Riverland where varietal examples of Bianco d'Alessano has won wine competition awards as an ""Alternative Variety"" (as opposed to an ""International Variety""). In Italy, the grape has also been historically used in the production of vermouth."
"Meslier-Saint-François is a white French wine grape variety that is now grown predominantly in the Loir-et-Cher department of the Loire Valley. Historically, the grape was found more widely throughout the Loire and western France and was even used in the production of Armagnac. However, for most of the 20th century Meslier-Saint-François has been following a similar route to the Loire grape Arbois with plantings rapidly declining. The grape is a crossing of Gouais blanc and Chenin blanc making it a sibling of Balzac blanc and Colombard."
"Minella bianca is a white Italian wine grape variety that is indigenous to the island of Sicily where it is grown in the foothills of Mount Etna. The name Minella is derived from the Sicilian word minna (or ""small breast"") to which the berries have some resemblance due to their elongated shape. Minella bianca is very rarely seen as a varietal and is most often used in field blends with Carricante and Catarratto bianco."
"Albaranzeuli bianco is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown primarily in Sardinia. Ampelographers use to believe that the grape was originally Spanish in origin and was introduced to the island when it was ruled by the Crown of Aragon. Recent DNA profiling has suggested that the grape may have originated on the island as a crossing between the red Sardinian wine grape Girò and the Spanish table grape , known locally as Pansa Rosa di Málaga and distinct from the Veneto wine grape Molinara that is used in Amarone. A pink skinned grape known as Albaranzeuli nero is also found in Sardinia but its exact relationship to Albaranzeuli bianco is not yet clear."
"Vigiriega is a Spanish white wine grape variety that is grown in the Canary Islands (El Hierro and Tenerife) and in the province of Granada (Andalusia). It used to be more widely cultivated throughout Andalusia until the Phylloxera epidemic at the end of the 19th Century. Vigiriega is a vigorous, resistant and high producing variety; it produces few medium-sized bunches, with large, loose berries. The berries are almost round and pale green, and are also used as table grapes. The must is usually high in sugar and in acidity, and is prized for making sparkling wine. The wines made from Vigiriega are fruity and not too aromatic, with the main notes being green apple, pear, citric fruits and fennel, depending on the ripeness. It is also known as bujariego, diego, derijadiego, vijariego, vijiriego and vujariego."
"Alionza is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Emilia-Romagna region of north central Italy, where it has a long history of being used since the 14th century as both a table grape and blending grape for wine production. While sometimes confused with the Greek wine grape Sklava, DNA analysis in the early 21st century has suggested, instead, that Alionza may be closely related to the Tuscan wine grape Trebbiano."
Balzac blanc is a white French wine grape variety that is grown in the Charente and Charente-Maritime regions of Southwest France where it was once used for Cognac production but now is nearly extinct. The grape was one thought to be a color mutation of Mourvèdre (known as Monastrell and Balzac noir) but DNA analysis in 2000 showed that the two grapes were distinct and that Balzac blanc was a crossing of Gouais blanc and Chenin blanc.
"Asprinio bianco is a white Italian wine grape variety grown primarily in southwest Italy around the Naples region of Campania. It is currently not believed to be related to the similarly named French wine grape of the Languedoc region, Aspiran. In Naples the grape is used to make lightly sparkling frizzante wine."
Biancame is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Marche and Emilia-Romagna regions of Italy. Here it is an important component in the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) wines of Bianchello del Metauro and .
"Saint-Pierre Doré is a white French wine grape variety grown primarily around the Saint-Pourçain AOC in the Auvergne region of Central France. While the grape has a long history in the region of being very productive and producing high yields, its plantings have been steadily declining over the last century and now the variety is almost extinct. DNA profiling has confirmed that it is one of several varieties descended from Gouais blanc, the French white grape variety that is also the mother vine to Chardonnay, Gamay and Melon de Bourgogne as well as several other varieties."
"Ortrugo is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Piacenza hills of the Emilia-Romagna region of north central Italy. Here the grape is often blended with Malvasia in the DOC white wines of the area. According to wine expert Oz Clarke, the grape has moderate acidity with high alcohol potential and often contributes a deep yellow color to the wine. In some regions the grape is used in slightly sparkling frizzante and fully sparkling spumante wines."
"Baratuciat is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Piedmont wine region of northwest Italy. For most of its history, Baratuciat was used mainly as a table grape with some limited use for wine production with sweet late-harvest dessert wines. On 23 June 2008 the grape was officially added to the Italian registry of wine grape varieties. In the Piedmontese language, the name Baratuciat is similar to the term used in the local dialect to denote cat's testicles, which ampelographers theorize may be a reference to the morphological shape of the grape's berries or to the characteristic ""Sauvignon blanc-like"" aromas of the grape, and wine made from it, which can be similar to a cat's litter box and elderflowers. Today, Baratuciat is found almost exclusively in the province of Turin, particularly in the Susa Valley, where it is found in the villages of Almese, Buttigliera Alta, Rosta, Rubiana and Villar Dora."
Chenel is a white South African wine grape variety that was produced by a crossing of Chenin blanc and Trebbiano. The variety was produced in the late 20th century for viticultural purposes and its resistance to various grape rots.
Retagliado bianco is a white Italian wine grape variety that has been growing in Sardinia since at least the late 19th century. Here it is an authorized grape in the Indicazione geografica tipica (IGT) wines of Colli del Limbara where it is usually blended with Vermentino.
"Cascarolo bianco is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown primarily in the Piedmont wine region of northwest Italy. The grape has a long history in the region and was noted in 1606 by , vineyard owner and official jeweler to Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy, as growing in the hills around Torino and producing wine of high esteem. It was once thought that Cascarolo bianco was the same variety as the Hungarian wine grape (also known as Augster Weisser) but DNA profiling in the early 21st century determined that the two grapes are unrelated. Today ampelographers believe that the grape is an offspring of the Swiss wine grape Rèze with DNA evidence suggesting some relationship with another white Piedmontese grape, Erbaluce. Ampelographers believe that the name Cascarolo is derived from the Italian cascolare, meaning ""to fall"", which could be a reference to the susceptibility of the variety to the viticultural hazard of coulure which causes unfertilized grape flowers to develop into poorly formed berries that fall off the vine."
"Prié blanc is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown almost exclusively in the Valle d'Aosta DOC of northwest Italy. The Valle d'Aosta varietal wine Blanc de Morgex et de La Salle is made from Prié blanc grapes. Ampelographers consider Prié blanc one of the oldest grape varieties in the Valle d'Aosta. Through a complex pedigree it appears to have some genetic relationship with most every other grape variety in the region. Recent DNA analysis has connected the grape to the Spanish wine grapes of in Andalusia and Albillo in Ribera del Duero and province of Ávila, but it is not yet known if the grape originated in Spain and traveled to Italy or the inverse."
"Sauvignon gris is a pink-colored wine grape that is a clonal mutation of Sauvignon blanc. The grape is primarily found in Bordeaux and Chile, where it was imported with Sauvignon blanc and Sauvignon vert cuttings. The grape produces less aromatic wines and is often used for blending."
"Bianchetta Trevigiana is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol and Veneto wine regions of northeast Italy. Here the grape is rarely used a varietal but, instead, is a permitted blending grape adding acidity to the wines of several Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) zones including the sparkling wine Prosecco and has also been used for vermouth production. The name Trevigiana is derived from the province of Treviso where the grape is believed to have originated from. While there are several grape varieties that variously share the synonym Bianchetta, most notably the grape Albarola, DNA analysis has shown no direct genetic relationship between Bianchetta Trevigiana and any of the other Bianchetta varieties. Likewise, despite sharing the synonym Vernaccia (the root of which translate to ""vernacular"" or ""local"") with the notable Tuscan and Sardinian wine grapes, Biancheta Trevigiana appears to have no close relationship with any of those varieties. Instead, ampelographers believe that the grape is the result of a natural crossing between the white Veneto wine grape Durella and the nearly extinct red wine grape ."
Biancolella is a white Italian wine grape variety grown primarily in the Campania region of southern Italy. It is a permitted grape in a few Campanian Denominazione di origine controllatas (DOCs) but is used mostly as a blending variety.
"Verdea is a white Italian wine grape variety that originated in Tuscany but is today mainly grown in the Lombardy wine region of northern Italy. The grape is sometimes confused with the white Verdeca grape of the Apulia region and the French wine grape Verdesse from Savoy due to similarities in their names and synonyms. Verdea can be used to make a wide variety of wines, ranging from the late harvested Vin Santo to dry sparkling wines."
"Marzemina bianca is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Veneto region of northeastern Italy. Ampelographers believe that the grape is a natural crossing of the Trentino wine grape Marzemino and the Soave wine grape Garganega. This parent-offspring relationship between Marzemina bianca and Marzemino makes the variety distinct from grapes like Pinot blanc and Grenache blanc which are other color mutations of Pinot noir and Grenache, respectively. DNA analysis has confirmed that the Veneto grape is the offspring of Marzemina bianca and Raboso Piave. Despite having the synonyms Champagna and Champagne Marzemina bianca is not grown in the French wine region of Champagne and is not used in the production of Champagne nor does the grape appear to have any known relation to the traditional Champagne wine grapes of Chardonnay, Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier. While the grape is usually used as a blending component in still wines and late harvest passito style wines, one producer in the Veneto does make a lightly sparkling frizzante version of the grape under the synonym Sampagne that is classified as a vino da tavola."
"Bigolona is a white Italian wine grape variety from the Valpolicella region of northeast Italy where it has been growing since at least the early 19th century. The wine has traditionally been used in the production of late harvest and botrytized dessert wines with the grape's synonym Smarzirola being derived from the Italian marcire meaning ""to rot""."
"Sarfeher is a white Hungarian wine grape planted primarily in the Great Hungarian Plain. In addition to making still, varietal wines Sarfeher is also used in sparkling wine production."
"Albanello bianco (or just Albanello) is a white Italian wine grape variety grown primarily in Sicily where it has a long tradition producing sweet dessert-style wines from grapes that have been dried in the sun on mats for several days after harvest. In the eighteenth century, the grape was an important component in the rare and expensive Marsala-style wine Ambrato di Comiso. In recent years, plantings of Albanello have been steadily declining and as of the 2000 census there were 125 hectares (309 acres) of the variety still planted in Italy, nearly all in Sicily. Part of the decline has been attributed to the variety's difficulties to cultivate and tendency to ripen late."
"Verdeca is a white Italian wine grape variety that is primarily grown in the Colli Piacentini region of Emilia-Romagna in central Italy and Apulia in southern Italy where ampelographers believe that the grape may have originated. In Apulia, it is one of the main grapes in the Denominazione di origine controllata wines of Locorotondo DOC and Martina Franca DOC along with Bianco d'Alessano. In Campania, it is grown on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius where it used as a blending variety with Falanghina, Coda di volpe and Greco in both the white wines and the sweet dessert wine of the region, Lacryma Christi. It is also a minor component used in the some vermouth production."
Lauzet is a white French wine grape variety that is permitted in the Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) wines of the Jurançon region. For most of the 20th century its numbers have been declining and today the grape is near extinction.
"Pampanuto (also known as Pampanino) is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Apulia region of southern Italy. Here the grape is used primarily a blending variety, often paired with higher acid grape varieties that need to have their acidity toned down."
"Findling is a white German wine grape variety that arose from a mutation of Müller-Thurgau plantings in the Mosel wine region. Compared to Müller-Thurgau, Findling produces grapes of higher must weights, which is an important consideration in the German wine classification system. However, according to wine expert Jancis Robinson, the grape produces wine of average to low quality and is prone to various grape rot infections."
"Rossese bianco is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown around the communes of Roddino and Sinio in the Langhe region of the province of Cuneo in Piedmont. While sharing the name Rossese with several Italian varieties (including Rossese di Dolceacqua, Grillo and ), DNA profiling has shown that all these varieties have unique genetic profiles and appear to have no close relationship to each other. Ampelographers believe that the name Rossese came from a description of the intense color of the Rossese berries with the many varieties that are known as Rossese having skin colors that range from deep red to pink to dark gold after veraison."
"Vega (also known as Incrocio Dalmasso 2/26) is a white Italian wine grape variety that was created in 1937 by by crossing the Hungarian wine grape Furmint with the Croatian wine grape Malvazija Istarska. Developed at the of Conegliano in the Veneto wine region of northeast Italy, the grape has slowly spread since its release. As of 2000, there were 28 hectares (69 acres) of Vega planted throughout Italy."
"Bariadorgia (also known as Carcajolo blanc) is a white Italian/French wine grape variety that likely originated on the island of Sardinia but today is only found in limited planting on Corsica. Despite similarities in synonyms, Bariadorgia/Carcajolo blanc is not a color mutation of the red Spanish wine grape Parraleta which is also known as Carcajolo near on Sardinia."
"Pallagrello bianco is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown in Campania. The grape has a long history in the region and was one of the varieties planted in 1775 by architect and engineer Luigi Vanvitelli in the fan-shaped Vigna del Ventaglio vineyard created for the royal palace of King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies (Ferdinand IV of Naples) in Caserta. Following the phylloxera epidemic of the mid-19th century and the economic devastation of the World Wars of the early 20th century, plantings of Pallagrello bianco declined greatly and the variety was thought to be extinct until it was rediscovered growing in an abandoned Campanian vineyard in the 1990s. Despite having similar names and both varieties originated in Campania, Pallagrello bianco is not a color mutation of the red Campanian wine grape Pallagrello nero though DNA profiling has not determined yet if the two varieties are closely related. DNA analysis has ruled out a relationship with another white Campanian wine grape, Coda di Volpe, which is known under the synonym Pallagrello and has similar looking ""fox tail-shaped"" grape clusters."
"Bia blanc is a white French wine grape variety that is no longer commercially cultivated for wine production with only a few plantings existing worldwide in viticultural archives and experimental vineyards. The exact origins of Bia blanc are not yet known though ampelographers have noted that the grapevine shares some morphological similarities to the red Isère grape Peloursin, one of the parent varieties to Petite Sirah (Durif)."
"Cococciola is a white Italian wine grape variety that is one of the few Italian grape varieties to have its number of plantings increase in the late 20th century at a time when measures to combat Europe's perceived wine surplus and general decline of viticulture saw the numbers of many varieties decline. Today, Cococciola is a permitted variety in the Trebbiano d'Abruzzo Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) from the Abruzzo region of central Italy (Ari, Vacri and Rocca San Giovanni) ."
"Verdello is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown mostly in the Umbria region of central Italy where it plays a minor role as a blending grape in several Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) wines, including Orvieto. Despite similarities in their names, the Italian Verdello grape has no close genetic relationship with the Portuguese wine grape Verdelho that is grown on the islands of Madeira and Azores. However, like the Portuguese grape, Verdello's name likely comes from the dark green color of its berries before veraison."
"Camaralet is a white French wine grape variety that is grown primarily in Southwest France. While historically known for its strong aromatics and flavor profile, the grape has been declining in importance and planting and is now nearly extinct."
Verdiso is a white Italian wine grape variety grown primarily in province of Treviso in the Veneto wine region of northeast Italy. It is a permitted variety in the sparkling wine Denominazione di origine controllata DOC of Prosecco located north of the city of Treviso along the Piave river.
"Mantonico bianco is a white Italian wine grape variety grown in the Calabria wine region of southern Italy. The grape should not be confused with the similarly named Calabrian grape Montonico bianco or with , which is known as Mantonico in the province of Cosenza in Calabria. In the early 21st century, DNA profiling suggested that Mantonico bianco may be one of the parent varieties of the red Calabrian grape Gaglioppo which is also known as Mantonico nero. Today Mantonico bianco is used to make both dry varietal and sweet passito-style dessert wines under several Calabrian Indicazione geografica tipica (IGT) designations. The grape is also potentially one of the permitted varieties in the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) wines of Bivongi and Donnici, however, the regulations for those DOCs do not differentiate between Mantonico bianco and Montonico bianco with the later most often being used in those wines."
"Aubin vert is a white French wine grape variety that is grown in the Lorraine region where it is an authorized variety for the Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) wines of the Moselle. While often confused for the Côtes de Toul grape Aubin blanc, DNA analysis in 1999 showed that Aubin vert was the result of a crossing of Gouais blanc with Pinot (an ancestor vine to Pinot noir). This makes the grape a half-sibling to Aubin blanc (a cross of Gouais blanc and the Jura wine grape Savagnin) but full sibling to Chardonnay, Aligoté, Gamay and Melon de Bourgogne."
"Mantonico bianco is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Calabria region of southern Italy. Ampelographers believe that the grape is likely of Greek origins and was transported to southern Italy by ancient Greek settlers. Though the variety has a long history in Calabria, its numbers have been slowly declining with 1100 hectares/2700 acres planted in the region by the end of the 20th century."
"Greco is an Italian wine grape that may be of Greek origin. The name relates to both white (Greco bianco) and black (Greco nero) grape varieties. While there is more land area dedicated to Greco nero, the Greco bianco is the grape most commonly referred to by ""Greco"". In the Campania region it is used to produce the Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) wine Greco di Tufo. In Calabria, it is used to make the Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) wine Greco di Bianco. The name ""Greco"" is sometimes used as a synonym for several varieties of supposed Greek origins-most notably Trebbiano."
"Nasco is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown primarily in Sardinia around the city of Cagliari. The grape has a long history on the island and is described by wine expert Jancis Robinson as ""ancient"". There is a special Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) designation, Nasco di Cagliari, for varietal wines that are 95–100% Nasco."
"Rèze is a white Swiss wine grape variety that is primarily found around the village of Sierre in the canton of Valais in southwest Switzerland. Here the variety is used to produce vin des glaciers—a sherry-style wine that utilizes a solera system of wine stored in larch wood or oak barrels that are never fully emptied with newer vintages being added to the barrels containing the older vintages. Despite its historical use in the production of vin des glaciers, its plantings have nonetheless been declining over the last century and now the variety is almost extinction. In the 21st century, DNA profiling determined that Rèze is likely one of the parent varieties to the Piedmont wine grape Cascarolo bianco and the Trentino wine grapes Nosiola and ."
"Versoaln (or Versailler) is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the South Tyrol wine region of northeast Italy. In the commune of Tisens, in South Tyrol, one of the world's oldest vines is a Versoaln vine planted at that has been dated to be at least 350 years old by the viticulturists at the University of Göttingen."
"Courbu is the name of three different, but related varieties of wine grapes primarily found in South West France. All are Vitis vinifera grapes. The name Courbu, without suffix, can refer to both Petit Courbu and Courbu blanc, and not all sources differ between the two."
"Vitovska or Vitouska, also known in Slovene as Vitovska Grganja or Garganja, is an Italian and Slovene wine grape predominantly planted in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region and the Karst Plateau in the Slovenian Littoral. The name vitovska is of Slovene origin, from Vitovlje, and grganja is of Friulian origin, from gargànie (nere). The grape is now mostly found in the lower Isonzo and Carso regions of northeast Italy. The grape produces a dry white wine. Vitovska is a cross between Prosecco Tondo and Malvasia Bianca Lunga."
"Vitis × doaniana (Doan's grape) is a hybrid grape resulting from the natural hybridization of Vitis mustangensis with Vitis acerifolia. Its native range is Oklahoma, Colorado, Texas, and New Mexico."
"Koshu (甲州 kōshū) is a white wine grape variety that has been grown primarily in the Koshu Valley in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan. Though long thought to be of exclusively European origin, it is now known to be a hybrid (probably naturally occurring) of Europe's Vitis vinifera and one or more East Asian Vitis species. The name “Koshu” is a former name for Yamanashi and the present-day name of the main town in the valley where the majority of Koshu grapes are grown."
"Manzanilla is a variety of fino sherry made around the port of Sanlúcar de Barrameda, in the province of Cádiz, Andalusia (Spain), and is produced under the Spanish Denominación de Origen Protegida (DOP) of Manzanilla-Sanlúcar de Barrameda DOP. In Spanish, chamomile infusion is called ""manzanilla"", and thus this wine gets the name because the wine's flavour is said to be reminiscent of such infusion. The sherry is manufactured using the same methods as a fino and results in a very pale, dry wine. It is often described as having a salty flavour, believed to develop from its being manufactured on the sea estuary of the Guadalquivir river. Sanlúcar de Barrameda's cool temperatures and high humidity contribute to a higher yield of flor yeast than in Jerez or El Puerto de Santa María. The thicker cap of flor better protects the wine from contact with the air, resulting in a fresher, more delicate flavour than other varieties of fino. It is typically aged for five years in a solera, but some types may be aged longer."
"Pione (ピオーネ pione) is a large-berried, purple skinned, table and rosé wine grape variety that has been grown in Japan since 1957."
"Teran grape is a variety of red grape from Istria, Croatia. It is mostly found in western part of Istria. It is a late-ripening variety and grows in large clusters with densely packed berries. Berries have highly resistant skin and deep ruby red color. The vine requires a lot of sun but less water. It is sensitive, both to extremely strong sun (burning hazard) and to excessive humidity (botrytis). When the grapes are fully ripe and all other needed conditions are met, a very good quality red wine can be made from them. Its alcohol content is usually between 11 and 14%."
"Chatus is a red wine grape variety native to Ardèche, France."
"Bangalore blue grape, also simply called Bangalore Blue, is a variety of fox grape (Vitis labrusca) grown in districts around Bangalore in India. It is one of the three major varieties of grape in the state of Karnataka (the other two being Thomson seedless and Anab-E-Shahi Dilkush). It received a geographical indication tag from the Government of India in 2013."
"Cserszegi fűszeres is the name of a white Hungarian wine-grape variety and of the wine made from it. Its name derives from its place of origin: the village of Cserszegtomaj, near Keszthely. The attribute fűszeres means spicy."
"Roussin de Morgex (sometimes known as Rossano Rosso in Italy) is an Italian grape variety, native to the western part of Valle d'Aosta in the municipality of Morgex. It is a pink-skinned teinturier grape that produced a light pink juice. Although it may by used as one of the autochthonous varieties allowed in the red DOC wine from the region, Valle d'Aosta Rosso, in 2010 it was not cultivated commercially; according to wine writer Ian D'Agata nobody had made wine from it in 300 years. Since then, small experimental plantings have been made, and a subsequent 20 bottle batch of pink sparkling wine produced by Cave Mont Blanc in 2014 showed sufficient promise to spur further research and planting."
"Corvinone is a red Italian wine grape variety native to the Veneto region of northern Italy. In 2010 a total grape growing area of 930 hectares (2,300 acres) was planted worldwide, with all of it in Italy save for 1 hectare (2.5 acres) in Argentina. Seldom found in wine alone, Corvinone is blended, along with Rondinella, Molinara and other autochthonous varieties, in Corvina-dominant red wines of the Valpolicella and Bardolino regions of Veneto. Corvinone is similar enough to the more widespread Corvina variety that it has historically often been mistaken as a clone; indeed its name in Italian suggests a meaning of ""large corvina"". More recent ampelographical work and DNA profiling has shown it to be a separate variety, however."
"Garró is a native Spanish red wine grape variety close to extinction. The word garró means ankle, particularly that of a pig, in Catalan. It has historically been grown in Baix Ebre in Catalonia, as well as in Valencia, and other parts of eastern Spain. The Spanish DOPs of Pla de Bages in Catalonia and Valencia grow it as an authorised variety under the synonym Mandó."
"Mencía, known as Jaen in Portugal, is a grape variety native to the western part of the Iberian Peninsula. In Spain, it is planted on over 9,100 hectares (22,000 acres), with another 2,500 hectares (6,200 acres) in neighboring Portugal. It is primarily found in the Bierzo, Ribeira Sacra, Valdeorras, Monterrei and Dão wine regions. Most wines produced from Mencía have traditionally been light, pale, relatively fragrant red wines for early consumption. This style of wine was the result of post-Phylloxera plantations on fertile plains, which tended to give high yields but diluted wine. In recent years, much more concentrated and complex wines have been produced by a new generation of winemakers, primarily from old vines growing on hillsides, often on schist soils, in combination with careful vineyard management. This has led to a renewed interest in Mencía and the denominaciones de origens using it, such as Bierzo, Valdeorras, Ribeira Sacra, Monterrei and the little-known Liébana. Since the 1990s, the grape is increasing in popularity, and an increasing number of noted Spanish winemakers are now working with it."
"Loureira Tinta is a rare red wine grape cultivated in Galicia, Spain. It is an authorised variety in the Rías Baixas DOP. Galicia also grows a white variety called Loureira."
"Chelva is an old variety of white wine grape originating in Extremadura, Spain. In 2015 there were 5,730 ha (14,159 acres) of Chelva vineyards in Spain, almost all of which were in Extremadura."
"Alcañón is a rare white wine grape variety from Somontano Aragon, Spain. It was previously thought to be the same variety as Macabeo, but genetic analysis has shown that they are distinct varieties. It is an authorised variety in the Somontano DOP."
"Doradilla is a variety of white wine grape originating in Málaga, southern Spain. It is a distinct variety from Doradillo."
"Sumoll Blanc is a white grape variety, native to Tarragona in Catalonia, Spain. Although it shares its name with the red grape variety Sumoll, it is genetically unrelated."
"Cayetana blanca, also known as Cayetana or Jaén, is a white Spanish wine grape. It is grown mainly in the south of Spain, especially in Extremadura and in the Jerez region where it is distilled for use in brandy production. It is mentioned in the 1513 treatise Obra de Agricultura by Gabriel Alonso de Herrera. It may have originated in the Alentejo region of Portugal, although it is now rare in that area. Cayetana Blanca was the third most planted white grape variety in Spain, with 39,919 ha (98,640 acres) in 2015, totalling 4% of the grapes and 9% of the white variety hectarage."
"Prensal is a white wine grape variety from the Balearic Islands, Spain. It is an authorised variety of the island's wine region of Binissalem (DOP), and there were 145 ha (359 acres) of Prensal grown in Spain in 2015."
"Hebén is a very rare white grape variety grown for wine and table grapes in Spain. It is an ancient variety found to have originated as a table grape in North Africa as Gibi. It is the parent variety of a large number of grapes grown in the Iberian Peninsula and the wider Mediterranean. It has paired with Alfrocheiro to produce the rare Portuguese varieties Trincadeira das pratas, Tinta grossa, Castelão branco, and Malvasia fina, as well as the Spanish Allarén. With Muscat of Alexandria it has produced Moscatel nunes/Nuno gomes in Portugal and Moscatel de Angüés in Spain. In Spain, it has a parent relationship with some very widely grown varieties: Airén, Cayetana, Viura, Xarel·lo, and Pedro Ximénez. In total, around 60 offspring varieties have been identified. Its sparse bunches are an attribute that can be seen some in children varieties such as Pedro Ximénez and Xarello. It produces solely female flowers, unlike the majority of self-pollinating vinifera varieties grown for wine today."
"Karasakız is a Turkish red wine grape variety grown in the Thrace region. It is known as Kuntra in Bozcaada. It has been used in cognac production for a long time. Recently, it is used as a wine grape variety by making both varietal and blending with other grape varieties. In Bozcaada, it is often blended with Karalahna grape variety."
"Karalahna is a Turkish red wine grape variety grown in Tenedos. It is used as a wine grape by making both varietal and blending with other grape varieties. In Tenedos, it is often blended with Kuntra grape variety."
"Emir is a native white grape in the Cappadocia region of Turkey. It is mostly planted in the Cappadocia and Nevşehir provinces in Turkey. Emir makes straw yellow color wines with green reflections that has a green apple, kiwi, lemon and orange aroma on the nose. It makes crisp, refreshing wines. Emir is also used to make sparkling wines as well. Wines are light, medium bodied, light yellow color with high acidity and delicate. Emir doesn't match with oak barrel and generally should be consumed in 1 – 2 years."
"Çavuş (Bozcaada Çavuşu), is a white prolific Turkish grape variety which is grown especially in Bozcaada-Çanakkale, Marmara Region and Central Anatolia Region."
"La Crescent is a white grape varietal developed by the University of Minnesota's cold hardy grape breeding program. Since its release to the market in 2002 La Crescent has been planted with success in Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Vermont, and Wisconsin. Per the licensing application the variety is cold-hardy to −36 °F (−38 °C) and per the patent application wines produced will feature desirable aromas of citrus, apricot, pineapple, and muscat (as found in Riesling or Vignoles varieties) and lacks ‘foxy’ aromas associated with V. labrusca and herbaceous aromas associated with V. riparia."
"Maréchal Foch (French pronunciation: ​[maʁeʃal fɔʃ]) is an inter-specific hybrid French red wine grape variety. It was developed at the Oberlin Institute in Colmar-Alsace, at the beginning of the 20th century, by Eugène Kuhlmann, then known as Kuhlmann 188-2. The variety arrived in the U.S. in 1946, where it was subsequently renamed Marechal Foch in honor of Marshall Ferdinand Foch, Supreme Allied Commander during the First World War. Some believe it to be a cross of Goldriesling (itself an intra-specific cross of Riesling and Courtiller Musqué) with a Vitis riparia - Vitis rupestris cross. Others contend that its pedigree is uncertain and may contain the grape variety . It ripens early, and it is cold-hardy and resistant to fungal diseases. The berry size is small, which makes it prone to bird injury. The quality of wine produced by Marechal Foch vines is highly dependent upon vine age, and the flavor profile associated with many new-world hybrid varietals is much reduced in examples made with fruit picked from older vines."
"Marechal Joffre is a red inter-specific hybrid grape variety created by French viticulturist (1858–1932). Like Marechal Foch, which was also created by Kuhlman, Marechal Joffre is named after a notable French World War I general, in this case Marshal (Fr. Maréchal) Joseph Joffre. The grape is a crossing of the Vitis vinifera variety Goldriesling and another inter-specific crossing . Through Millardet et Grasset 101-14, the pedigree of Marechal Joffre includes varieties from other species in the Vitis genus including Vitis riparia and Vitis rupestris."
"Zarya severa (Northern Lights) is a red grape variety. It is a descendant of the Asiatic wild grape Vitis amurensis and the grape Malingre Précoce and is thus a hybrid vine. The crossing took place at the Potapenko Viticulture Research Institute in Rostov Oblast, Russia in 1936. Because of its high winter frost resistance as well as its resistance to downy mildew, this variety, often mentioned by breeders in Eastern Europe, became a major breeding stock in the search for new varieties. Synonym: Zora Severa Parentage: Malingre Précoce x Vitis amurensis"
"Hibernal is a variety of white wine grape of the hybrid with Vitis vinifera which was developed in 1944, by Heinrich Birk at the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute. The variety is a genetic crossbreed of the Seibel 7053 and Riesling clone 239 grape varieties. Hibernal has had plant variety protection since 1977 and was included on the list of varieties in 1999. Hibernal was developed for the same reasons as other new varieties developed by the Geisenheim Institute, such as Ehrenbreitsteiner, , Rondo and Saphira. The basic idea was to develop pest and fungus-resistant vines. In bad years Hibernal is susceptible to mildew (powdery mildew and downy mildew) and must be provided with 1-2 sulphur treatments shortly before and/or shortly after flowering. The variety, however, has a very good winter hardiness even against stronger frosts. The full-bodied and racy wine produced has a taste at times similar to a Scheurebe. The variety is particularly important in South East Europe."
"The Concord grape is a cultivar derived from the grape species Vitis labrusca (also known as fox grape) that are used as table grapes, wine grapes and juice grapes. They are often used to make grape jelly, grape juice, grape pies, grape-flavored soft drinks, and candy. The grape is sometimes used to make wine, particularly sacramental kosher wine. Traditionally, most commercially produced Concord wines have been finished sweet, but dry versions are possible if adequate fruit ripeness is achieved. The grape is named after the town in Massachusetts where it was developed. The skin of a Concord grape is typically dark blue or purple, and often is covered with a lighter-coloured epicuticular wax ""bloom"" that can be rubbed off. It is a slip-skin variety, meaning that the skin is easily separated from the fruit. Concord grapes have large seeds and are highly aromatic. The Concord grape is particularly prone to the physiological disorder black spot. In the United States 417,800 tons were produced in 2011. The major growing areas are the Finger Lakes District of New York, Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, Southwestern Michigan, and the Yakima Valley in Washington. They are sometimes found growing wild."
Rabigato is a white Portuguese wine grape variety that is popularly grown in the Douro Region especially Douro Superior.
"Taferielt is an indigenous Moroccan wine, table, and raisin grape. It produces medium to very long clusters of dense, ellipsoid/obovoid, blue-black grapes. It is a parent, along with Jaén blanco, of the Moroccan variety Blanc de Rhafsaï. It is a very old variety thought to descend from the wild vines of Morocco, showing clear differentiation from other vines of the Middle Atlas, and the Kabylie and Aurès Mountains of Algeria. It covered 80% of vineyard space in the Rif mountains in the early 1960s, and previously was found as far afield as the Balearic Islands in pre-phylloxera times, where it was known as Farrana noir. Its name, Taferielt, probably originates as a placename since it does not occur as a word in any of the Berber dialects in its traditional area of cultivation. It has good resistance to oidium and mildew."
"St. Vincent is a red wine grape that originated in the United States from a chance seedling that first came to the attention of Scott G. Toedebusch, in 1973, while managing a vineyard owned by Lucian W. Dressel in Augusta, Missouri. Dressel originally called the vine “Stromboli” because the leaves turned a bright red in the fall, and the vines had volcanic production. Philip Wagner of Boordy Nursery in Maryland, one of the original propagators of the vine, suggested that a more melodious name would be St. Vincent, (the name of the patron saint of the Cote d'Or in Burgundy), and the name was changed."
"Pálava is a variety of white wine grape developed in 1953 by in Moravia. The variety is a genetic crossbreed of the Gewürztraminer and Müller Thurgau grape varieties. The variety has not spread far beyond its homeland, outside of the Czech Republic is planted in Slovakia, albeit in small quantities. In 2018 it was grown in the Czech Republic on 594 hectares of vineyards, mostly (45%) in the Mikulovská region. Pálava wines are typically full-bodied, aromatic and subtly sweet. Their colour is golden-yellow."
"Mtevandidi is an indigenous red grape variety from the region of Guria in the country of Georgia, primarily used for producing table wine. It is known also by the synonyms Akido (""two-bunched sprout""), Achido, Didd Mtevana, Didmtevana, and Didtevano.There are no written sources regarding the origin of Mtevandidi. Botanical and agricultural features suggest that this variety is indigenous to Georgia."
"Chinuri (also known as Kaspuri and Kaspuri White) is a white wine grape variety of high acidity. It is associated with Georgian wine, and is grown in Kartli, reaching full maturity by late October. Chinuri is commonly used for both still and sparkling wines by blending with Goruli Mtsvane and Aligote.It exhibits good resistance to fungal diseases and phylloxera."
"Krasnostop Zolotovsky is an indigenous Russian grape variety that is regarded as the local grape with the best potential for red wine production. The name 'Krasnostop' is derived from the Russian words Krasniy (Russian: Красный, which means Red) and Stopa (Russian: Стопа, which means Grape stalks), that describe the appearance of its stems. It gives wines that are typically rich in tannins, alcohol and acidity, with flavors reminiscent of dark plums, redcurrant and green pepper. Notable producers include and , both of which produce a varietal wine from this rare grape."
"Sezão (Spanish: Sousón), formerly known as Souzão, is a Portuguese wine grape that is used in the production of port wine and table wines."
"Nocera is a dark black Italian grape variety producing deeply colored, high acidity wines. It originates from the north eastern region of Sicily and is now also grown in Calabria. It is an allowed component of five DOC wines (Bivongi, Mamertino di Milazzo, Sicilia, Faro, and S. Anna di Isola Capo Rizzuto) as well as 15 IGT wines. It has good vigor but poor disease resistance."
"Prunesta is a rare native Italian red wine grape variety. According to Ian D'Agata in Native Wine Grapes of Italy: ""It has a midium-sized, very stocky, pyramidal, winged bunch, with large, oval, blue-black berries."" It is a component of 10 Calabrian IGT wines, primarily in the Province of Reggio Calabria and the Province of Crotone."
"Bayan Shirey is a high-quality local grape variety native to Azerbaijan. Named after the village of Bayan, Dashkesan region of Azerbaijan. The variety is successfully cultivated in the Russian Federation (Dagestan), Moldova, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan. Bunches weigh 180-190 grams. Vegetation period is 160-165 days. Bayan Shirey is also the name for a white wine made from the Bayan Shirey grape variety grown in some areas of Azerbaijan."
"Carricante is a white wine indigenous to Sicily, Italy. This late-ripening vine is the main variety used in the Etna DOC. It is usually found blended with Catarratto and Minella bianca. As a varietal wine, Carricante produces a fresh, straw-yellow, lightly fragrant white wine. The name Carricante comes from the Italian caricare (to load, to burden), in reference to the variety's heavy yields. It is not related to the variety Nocera, which is sometimes called Carricante nero. Carricante is grown at high altitudes on Mount Etna relative to other grapes, growing at around 950 meters above sea level on the eastern slopes and at 1,050 meters on the southern slopes. Wines made from it tend to be high in total acidity with a low pH and have traditionally been subject to malolactic fermentation."
"Muscadelle is a white wine grape variety. It has a simple aroma of grape juice and raisins like grapes of the Muscat family of grapes, but it is unrelated. DNA analysis has indicated that Muscadelle is a cross between Gouais blanc and an unidentified grape variety."
"Beba is a white Spanish grape variety grown for both wine and table grapes in the province of Extremadura. It is a vigorous, high-yielding vine that is sensitive to low temperatures and dampness during bloom. Annual productivity varies greatly depending on prevailing weather influences. It is grown for both wine and table grapes. It is also known as: Beba de los Santos, Beba de los Santos de Maimona, Beba de Palos, Beba Dorada, Beba Dorada de Huelva, Beba Dorada de Jaen, Beba Dorada de Jerez, Beva, Bevah, Bevan, Eva de los Santos, Eva de los Santos de Maimona, and White Malaga. This was the vine presented by Louis XIV's ambassador to King Narai of Siam, where it became the start of a flourishing grape industry."
"Brustiano faux is an indigenous French wine grape that is no longer in cultivation in France as of 2010. The variety is currently preserved by the Centre de Ressources Biologiques de la Vigne, a division of the INRA in France.

Bical is a white Portuguese wine grape planted primarily in the Bairrada region. It can produce high acid wines and is often used in sparkling wine production.
"Antão Vaz is a native Portuguese white wine grape variety. Genetic testing has shown it to be a cross of the white Cayetana blanca (through which it is a grandchild of Hebén) and the almost unknown red , which is thought to be extinct in its native Portugal. It is grown primarily in the Alentejo region, with additional plantings around Lisbon and in the Península de Setúbal. It is vigorous and productive, and requires a hot climate. The thick skins on these large loosely packed grapes enable them to withstand high heat and dehydration. It produces complex, light yellow wines with citrus and tropical aromas. Depending on the time of harvest, the wines can range from very acidic to ripe and alcoholic."

"Palo Cortado is a rare variety of sherry that is initially aged under flor to become a fino or amontillado, but inexplicably loses its veil of flor and begins aging oxidatively as an oloroso. The result is a wine with some of the richness of oloroso and some of the crispness of amontillado. Only about 1–2% of the grapes pressed for sherry naturally develop into palo cortado."
"Oloroso (""scented"" in Spanish) is a variety of fortified wine (sherry) made in Jerez and Montilla-Moriles and produced by oxidative aging. It is normally darker than Amontillado. Oloroso is usually dark and nutty. Unlike the fino and Amontillado sherries, in oloroso the flor yeast is suppressed by fortification at an earlier stage. This causes the finished wine to lack the fresh yeasty taste of the fino sherries. Without the layer of flor, the sherry is exposed to air through the slightly porous walls of the American or Canadian oak casks, and undergoes oxidative aging. As the wine ages, it becomes darker and stronger and is often left for many decades. Oloroso sherry is also the base for many of the sweet sherries developed for the international market, such as Bristol Cream, in which oloroso is sweetened and sometimes has the color removed by charcoal filtering to achieve a desired effect."
"Amontillado (Spanish pronunciation: [amontiˈjaðo]) is a variety of sherry wine characterised by being darker than fino but lighter than oloroso. It is named after the Montilla region of Spain, where the style originated in the 18th century, although the name ""Amontillado"" is sometimes used commercially as a simple measure of colour to label any sherry lying between a fino and an oloroso. It features prominently in the Edgar Allan Poe short story ""The Cask of Amontillado"". An Amontillado sherry begins as a fino, it fortified to approximately 13.5% alcohol with a cap of flor yeast limiting its exposure to the air. A cask of fino is considered to be amontillado if the layer of flor fails to develop adequately, is intentionally killed by additional fortification, or is allowed to die off through non-replenishment. Without the layer of flor, amontillado must be fortified to approximately 17.5% alcohol so that it does not oxidise too quickly. After the additional fortification, Amontillado oxidises slowly, exposed to oxygen through the slightly porous American or Canadian oak casks, and gains a darker colour and richer flavour than fino. Amontillado is characterized by nutty aromas, tobacco, aromatic herbs and often ethereal, polished notes of oak. The fusion of two different aging processes makes Amontillado wines extraordinarily complex and intriguing."

"Blanc du Bois (French, white [grape] of the woods [forest]) is an American hybrid grape that was created in 1968 by John A. Mortensen at the University of Florida’s Central Florida Research and Education Center in Leesburg, Florida. Mortensen created this variety by crossing various Vitis vinifera grape varieties such as Golden Muscat with native Florida varieties. When released in 1987, Blanc du Bois became another grape variety in the small but growing number of vine types that can both produce marketable wine on their own yet can withstand Pierce's Disease, a bacterial infection that destroys nearly all vinifera vinestocks imported into the southern United States. Despite the name, the grape variety has nothing to do with woods or forests; rather it was named in honor of Emile DuBois, an influential grapegrower and winemaker in the Tallahassee, Fla., area."

"Madeira is a fortified wine made on the Portuguese Madeira Islands, off the coast of Africa. Madeira is produced in a variety of styles ranging from dry wines which can be consumed on their own, as an aperitif, to sweet wines usually consumed with dessert. Cheaper cooking versions are often flavoured with salt and pepper for use in cooking, but these are not fit for consumption as a beverage. The islands of Madeira have a long winemaking history, dating back to the Age of Exploration (approximately from the end of the 15th century) when Madeira was a standard port of call for ships heading to the New World or East Indies. To prevent the wine from spoiling, neutral grape spirits were added. On the long sea voyages, the wines would be exposed to excessive heat and movement which transformed the flavour of the wine. This was discovered by the wine producers of Madeira when an unsold shipment of wine returned to the islands after a round trip. Today, Madeira is noted for its unique winemaking process which involves oxidizing the wine through heat and ageing. The younger blends (three and five years old) are produced with artificial methods that heat and accelerate the aging process and the older blends, colheitas and frasqueiras are produced by the canteiro method. Because of these methods of production these wines are very long lived and those produced by the canteiro method will survive for decades and even centuries, even after being opened. Wines that have been in barrels for many decades are often removed and stored in demijohns where they may remain unharmed indefinitely. Some wines produced in small quantities in Crimea, California and Texas are also referred to as ""Madeira"" or ""Madera""; however, most countries conform to the EU PDO regulations and limit the use of the term Madeira or Madère to only those wines that come from the Madeira Islands."

"Terence Thomas Kevin O'Leary (born 9 July 1954) is a Canadian businessman, author, politician, and television personality. From 2004 to 2014, he appeared on various Canadian television shows, including the business news programmes SqueezePlay and The Lang and O'Leary Exchange, as well as the reality television shows Dragons' Den and Redemption Inc. In 2008, he appeared on Discovery Channel's Project Earth. Since 2009, he has appeared on Shark Tank, the American version of Dragons' Den. O'Leary co-founded SoftKey Software Products, a technology company that sold software geared toward family education and entertainment. During the late 1980s and 1990s, SoftKey acquired rival companies such as Compton's New Media, The Learning Company, and Brøderbund. SoftKey later changed its name to The Learning Company and was acquired by Mattel in 1999, with the sale making O'Leary a multimillionaire. O'Leary was soon fired by Mattel after the acquisition resulted in significant losses and multiple shareholder lawsuits. In 2017, he campaigned to be the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada. He was a frontrunner in the polls during much of that time, but dropped out in April 2017, one month before the election, citing a lack of support in Quebec."

"Gerald Albert Asher (born 18 August 1932) is an English wine personality, based since 1974 in San Francisco, California. Initially a wine merchant and importer, today he is a wine writer. Born in London and raised partly in rural Essex because of the Blitz, Asher's career in wine began in 1950, when he took a part-time job at a wine retailer in London's Shepherd Market. He founded his own merchant house, Asher, Storey and Co, in 1955, to import rare and lesser-known French wines to Britain. Active until 1970, the firm was widely seen as ground-breaking for its introduction to the British market of several previously obscure wines that proceeded to become popular. In 1971, Asher relocated to New York to take up a senior position at Austin, Nichols and Co, which imported Bordeaux-classed wines to the United States. The next year he also became wine editor at Gourmet magazine, a post he would hold for the next three decades, writing the ""Wine Journal"" column, which eventually became monthly. In 1974, he received the Mérite agricole from the French government for his contributions to French agriculture. He moved the same year to San Francisco, where he became head of the Monterey Wine Company. He writes that he had ""a topsy-turvy introduction to California wine"", having never tasted any before a 1967 visit, but he soon began championing it, organising the annual California Vintners Barrel Tasting Dinner along with Paul Kovi and Tom Margittai of New York's Four Seasons Restaurant. The barrel tasting, which started in 1976, played an important role in building the image and understanding of California wines on the East Coast of the United States, and over the next decade became seen by critics as the wine event of the year. Asher started the Mosswood Wine Company in 1978, within the McKesson Corporation, and headed it until 1987, when McKesson sold off its interests in wine and spirits to concentrate on pharmaceuticals. Asher took early retirement to focus solely on his wine writing, which he continues today. He retained the post of wine editor at Gourmet until 2002, and thereafter contributed a selection of wines to each issue until the magazine discontinued in 2009. Many of his wine essays from Gourmet have been republished in book form; five volumes of these columns have been published, most recently A Carafé of Red in 2012. Asher's writing and knowledge of wine are both acclaimed, with British wine critic Jancis Robinson calling him ""America's most elegant wine writer"". James Beard, an American chef and food writer, says Asher's writing ""makes one feel that one is sitting in a room with Gerald, enjoying his ... awesome knowledge and expertise in the world of wine."" Asher has received many accolades for his writing and work with wine during his life. He was inducted into the California Vintners' Hall of Fame by the Culinary Institute of America in 2009."
"Jofroi of Waterford (fl. 1300) was a French translator. Probably a native of Waterford in Ireland, Jofroi was a Dominican, apparently based in Paris, where he produced translations of Latin works into the French language. ""He has no surviving connection with Ireland other than his name. It appears from an allusion in his work that he was based in Paris."" Jofroi's known translations are: 
* translation of the Secretum Secretorum, one of the most widely read books in Western Europe in the Late Middle Ages. Jofroi's French was later translated into English. 
* translation of a history of the Trojan War, authorship attributed to Dares Phrygius (pseudepigraphical). (Another book widely circulated in Latin in the Late Middle Ages.) 
* translation of a history of Rome by Eutropius (historian). (Once again, a popular book in Latin). 
* a co-translation, with Servais Copale, of three prose poems His original work is a catalogue of all the known wines and ales of Europe."
"Benjamin Cane is an Australian winemaker currently based in Western Australia. He has made award-winning wines of different varietals across three continents, with pinot noir standing out as a true source of passion and inspiration."
"The following four constitute the Italian system of labelling and legally protecting Italian wine: 
* Denominazione di origine (DO, rarely used; pronounced [denominatˈtsjoːne di oˈriːdʒine]; English: “designation of origin”), 
* Indicazione geografica tipica (IGT; [indikatˈtsjoːne dʒeoˈɡraːfika ˈtiːpika]; “indication of geographical typicality”), 
* Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC; [denominatˈtsjoːne di oˈriːdʒine kontrolˈlaːta]; “controlled designation of origin”), and 
* Denominazione di origine controllata e garantita (DOCG; [denominatˈtsjoːne di oˈriːdʒine kontrolˈlaːta ɛ ɡaranˈtiːta]; “controlled and guaranteed designation of origin”). The system was introduced in 1963 shortly after the Treaty of Rome established Italy as a founding member of the European Economic Community, and was modelled on the extant French Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) laws. It was overhauled in 1992 to match new European Union law on Protected Designation of Origin, introducing the more general Denominazione di Origine Protetta (DOP) designation for foods and agricultural products, including wines. Further EU reforms to harmonise agricultural policy in 2008 meant that designations used in member states, and thus Italian designations, were registered with the EU by the end of 2011, with subsequent new denominations or elevations approved by the EU."
"Indicazione geografica tipica (Italian: [indikatˈtsjoːne dʒeoˈɡraːfika ˈtiːpika]) is the third of four classifications of wine recognized by the government of Italy. Created to recognize the unusually high quality of the class of wines known as Super Tuscans, IGT wines are labeled with the locality of their creation. However, they do not meet the requirements of the stricter DOC or DOCG designations, which are generally intended to protect traditional wine formulations such as Chianti or Barolo. It is considered broadly equivalent to the French Indication Géographique Protégée designation (and former vin de pays classification); wines from Aosta Valley, where French is co-official, may state Vin de pays on the label in place of Indicazione geografica tipica. This classification is seen to be a higher quality wine than vino da tavola."
"Trockenbeerenauslese (literal meaning: ""dried berries selection"") is a German language wine term for a medium to full body dessert wine. Trockenbeerenauslese is the highest in sugar content in the Prädikatswein category of the Austrian and German wine classifications. Trockenbeerenauslese wines, often called ""TBA"" for short, are made from individually selected grapes affected by noble rot (i.e., botrytized grapes). This means that the grapes have been individually picked and are shrivelled with noble rot, often to the point of appearing like a raisin. They are therefore very sweet and have an intensely rich flavor, frequently with a lot of caramel and honey bouquet, stone fruit notes such as apricot, and distinctive aroma of the noble rot. The finest examples are made from the Riesling grape, as this retains plenty of acidity even at the extreme ripeness. Other grape varieties are also used, such as Scheurebe, Ortega, Welschriesling, Chardonnay, and Gewürztraminer and many are more prone to noble rot than Riesling since they ripen earlier. These wines are rare and expensive due to the labor-intensive method of production, and the fact that very specific climatic conditions (which do not necessarily occur every year) are required to create botrytized grapes. Some of the best wines of this type are sold almost exclusively at the various German wine auctions. They are usually golden to deep golden in colour, sometimes even dark caramel. The body is viscous, very thick and concentrated, and arguably can be aged almost indefinitely due to the preservative powers of its high sugar content. Although TBA has very high residual sugar level, the finest specimens are far from being due to high level of acidity. Trockenbeerenauslesen have also been in common production since the 1960s in Austria. Most TBA wines from Austria come from Neusiedlersee, Burgenland. On both sides of lake Neusiedl those wines are produced. East of the lake, the village of Illmitz is known for the production of ""liquid gold"". At the western side of the lake in Rust and St. Margarethen, wine of exceptionally good quality can be found. This region is known for its wide and shallow lakes which can lose more than half their volume due to evaporation. The mists created by these lakes provide a very conducive climate for noble rot to shrivel grapes. The style is similar to, but much more concentrated than, Sélection de Grains Nobles from Alsace. In comparison to Sauternes, the wines are considerably sweeter, have a lower alcoholic strength and are usually not oaked. As with most other premium grade dessert wines, Trockenbeerenauslese is to a large extent sold in half bottles of 375 ml."
"Armand de Brignac, colloquially known as the ""Ace of Spades"" after its logo, is the name of the tête de cuvée Champagne brand produced by Champagne Cattier and sold in opaque metallic bottles. The brand's first bottling, Armand de Brignac Brut Gold, is identifiable by its gold bottle with French pewter Ace of Spades labels. The Armand de Brignac champagnes are produced in a multi-vintage style, and the Brut Gold cuvée is a blend of the grape varieties Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier, and Chardonnay. Two other cuvées, a Rosé and a Blanc de Blancs (100% Chardonnay), were released in 2008. In 2015, a Demi Sec and a Blanc de Noirs (100% Pinot Noir) also joined the range."
"In Peru, pisco is a ""designation of origin"" that is reserved for the alcoholic beverage belonging to a variety of grape aguardiente produced in Peru since the late 16th century. It is the typical destillate of this country, elaborated from fermented wine of certain grapes (Vitis vinifera), whose value has crossed its borders, as evidenced by the records of shipments made through the port of Pisco to Europe and other parts of the Americas since the 17th century, places such as England, Spain, Portugal, Guatemala, Panama and United States, from the mid-19th century. It is one of the productos bandera del Perú and it is only produced on the coast (up to 2000 meters above sea level) in the departments of Lima, Ica, Arequipa, Moquegua y Tacna. About the designation of origin pisco, there is a dispute between Chile and Peru. While in the former country the product is simply referred to as ""pisco"", in the latter the label ""Peruvian pisco"" is promoted for their variety of pisco as a form of aggressive marketing in their national brands, generally with the support and encouragement of the government as a way of improving their national image."
"The appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC; French pronunciation: ​[apɛlasjɔ̃ dɔʁiʒin kɔ̃tʁole]; ""controlled designation of origin"") is a French certification granted to certain French geographical indications for wines, cheeses, butters, and other agricultural products, all under the auspices of the government bureau Institut national des appellations d'origine, now called Institut national de l'origine et de la qualité (INAO). It is based on the concept of terroir and a form of geographic protectionism."
"The country of Georgia is the first among the EU neighbourhood countries to take an important step towards protecting its local food and beverages from being copied in other countries. The country has a rich history of local and specialist agricultural production and has long been famed for its wines. Names of as many as 18 premium quality local wines have been protected by the use of appellation system, the appellations usually being the geographical name of the area in which the wine is produced. While the appellation system is associated particularly with wine, the geographical indication is a type of intellectual property right which indicates a geographical area and is used to designate the goods originating in that geographical area, specific quality, reputation, or other characteristics of which are attributable to that geographical area and production or processing or preparation of which takes place in the geographical area.The list of products with names protected under the appellation system was later expanded by mineral waters and currently as many as 37 products including local sorts of cheese, dairy, sweets and spirits have been registered as appellations of origins and geographical indications in Georgia."
"The denominação de origem controlada (or DOC) is the system of protected designation of origin for fruit, wines, cheeses, butters, and other agricultural products from Portugal."
"Semi-generic is a legal term used in by the United States Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau to refer to a specific type of wine designation. The majority of these were originally based on the names of well-known European wine-producing regions. Consumers didn't recognize grape varieties at that time and New World producers used the familiar names to suggest the style of wine they were offering for sale. U.S. regulations require that semi-generic names (for example, California champagne) may be used on a wine label only if there appears next to such name the appellation of ""the actual place of origin"" in order to prevent any possible consumer confusion. The practice primarily ceased in 2006 with the Wine Trade Agreement, though existing brands can continue the practice, considered grandfathered in."
"Valtiendas is a Spanish geographical indication for wines referred to legally as Vino de calidad con Indicación Geográfica. This is one step below the mainstream Denominación de Origen quality wines and one step above the less stringent Vino de la Tierra table wines on the quality ladder. It is located in the province of Segovia (region of Castile and León) and borders on the well-known wine region of Ribera del Duero. Only the following red grape varieties are authorized: Tempranillo or Tinta del país, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Albillo, Garnacha and Merlot."
"A growing region is an area suited by climate and soil conditions to the cultivation of a certain type of crop or plant group. Most crops are cultivated not in one place only, but in several distinct regions in diverse parts of the world. Cultivation in these areas may be enabled by a large-scale regional climate, or by a unique microclimate. Growing regions, because of the need for climate consistency, are usually oriented along a general latitude, and in the United States these are often called ""belts"". The growing region of a traditional staple crop often has a strong cultural cohesiveness."
"Prodotto agroalimentare tradizionale (PAT) is an official approval for traditional Italian regional food products similar to the Protected Geographical Status of the European Union. A list of approved products is published by the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies. It lists only products that do not qualify for pan-European approval, and as such PAT is only applicable within Italy. The denomination is attributed by each regional government, in collaboration with the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies. In 2018 the region with the largest number of approved products was Campania, with 515."
"A wine rating is a score assigned by one or more wine critics to a wine tasted as a summary of that critic's evaluation of that wine. A wine rating is therefore a subjective quality score, typically of a numerical nature, given to a specific bottle of wine. In most cases, wine ratings are set by a single wine critic, but in some cases a rating is derived by input from several critics tasting the same wine at the same time. A number of different scales for wine ratings are in use. Also, the practices used to arrive at the rating can vary. Over the last couple of decades, the 50–100 scale introduced by Robert M. Parker, Jr. has become commonly used. This or numerically similar scales are used by publications such as Wine Enthusiast, Wine Spectator, and Wine Advocate. Other publications or critics, such as Jancis Robinson and Michael Broadbent, may use a 0–20 scale, or a 0–5 scale (often in terms of numbers of stars) either with or without half-star steps. In recent years, with the advent of aggregated user-generated ratings, there has also proliferated group rating systems, such as the one employed by CellarTracker, using input from non-professional wine tasters who taste under differing conditions. In addition to a simple numerical score, most wine ratings are meant to supplement the wine tasting notes, which are brief descriptions of the wine critic's overall impression of the wine, including its flavor qualities. However, often the emphasis (in particular in marketing) is on the score applied by a critic rather than on the total wine tasting note."
"The color of wine is one of the most easily recognizable characteristics of wines. Color is also an element in wine tasting since heavy wines generally have a deeper color. The accessory traditionally used to judge the wine color was the tastevin, a shallow cup allowing one to see the color of the liquid in the dim light of a cellar. The color is an element in the classification of wines."
Piquette is a French wine term which commonly refers to a vinous beverage produced by adding water to grape pomace but sometimes refers to a very simple wine or a wine substitute.
"Vendange tardive (""VT"") means ""late harvest"" in French. The phrase refers to a style of dessert wine where the grapes are allowed to hang on the vine until they start to dehydrate. This process, called passerillage, concentrates the sugars in the juice and changes the flavours within it. The name is sometimes written as the plural form, vendanges tardives, referring to the fact that several runs through the vineyard is often necessary to produce such wines.In other countries such as Germany or Austria the term Spätlese is used to describe wine using the same making process. Alsace wines were the first to be described as vendange tardive but the term is now used in other regions of France. Since 1984, the term has been legally defined in Alsace and may only be applied to wines that exceed a minimum must weight and pass blind tasting by the INAO. Sélection de Grains Nobles (""SGN"") is an even sweeter category, for grapes affected by noble rot. Vendange tardive is also an official wine designation in Luxembourg."
"Federweisser (also Federweißer , from German Feder, ""feather"", and weiß, ""white""; from the appearance of the suspended yeast, also known as Sturm, from German Sturm, storm in Austria), is an alcoholic beverage, typically 9% alcohol by volume, although versions of up to 13.5% alcohol by volume are not uncommon. (In contrast to all other alcoholic beverages, the alcohol content stated on a bottle of Federweisser is inconclusive, and presents an uppermost limit, not the actual content at any given time.) It is the product of fermented freshly pressed grape juice, known as must. The term in principle includes all stages of fermentation from must to finished wine. Across continental Europe, it is known as Suser, Sauser, Neuer Süßer (new sweet), or Junger Wein (young wine) in Southwest Germany, Switzerland and South Tyrol, Fiederwäissen in Luxembourg, Sturm (storm, from the cloudy appearance) in Austria, Federweißer in Bavaria, Neuer Wein (new wine) in the Palatinate, Federweiser in Franconia, burčiak in Slovakia, burčák in Czech Republic, vin bourru or vernache in France, murci or karcos in Hungary, ""მაჭარი"" (machari) in Georgia, ""մաճառ"" (machar) in Armenia. (Note that, in Switzerland, this same term has a completely different meaning. There, Federweisser refers to a white wine made from red grapes, typically pinot noir.)"
"H. Bonciu, or Horia Bonciu (Romanian pronunciation: [ˈhori.a ˈbont͡ʃju]; reportedly born Bercu, Beniamin or Hieronim Haimovici, also known as Bonciu Haimovici, Haimovici Bonciu; May 19, 1893 – April 27, 1950), was a Romanian novelist, poet, journalist and translator, noted especially as an atypical figure on his country's avant-garde scene. His work, comprising several volumes of poetry and two novels, is a mixture of influences from the diverse literary schools of Europe's modernism, and, unusually in the context of Romanian literature, borrows heavily from German-born movements such as Expressionism. The autofictional and cruel detail in Bonciu's narratives makes him a senior figure among Romania's own authors, while its capture of the unnaturally grotesque also finds him as one of the country's Neoromantics and Surrealists. Opposed by the literary establishment when his erotic subjects became more widely known, and further marginalized for his Jewish origin, H. Bonciu was even prosecuted in the 1930s on grounds of ""pornography"". His work was banned by the local fascist movements, and later selectively censored by the communist regime. The controversy, like his refusal to rally with any particular cultural movement of the interwar, has touched the critical reception of his work, and has introduced a decades-long debate about its contextual value. While some scholars find Bonciu a necessary addition to the modern literary canon and a forerunner of postmodern literature, others describe him as mediocre or pretentious."

The Franzia family sold the brand to Coca-Cola in 1973 when Fred Franzia was in his early adult years; and it was sold to The Wine Group in 1981. Teresa Franzia (born Teresa Carrara, 1879–1949) founded the Franzia Wine Company in 1906. Teresa's daughter, Amelia Franzia Gallo, was the wife of winemaker Ernest Gallo. Teresa loaned Ernest the money to start his company."
"Blue Nun is a German wine brand launched by the company (Mainz) in 1923 with the 1921 vintage, and which between the 1950s and 1980s was a very popular international brand. For most of its existence, Blue Nun was a single German wine, which until the late 1990s was classified as a Liebfraumilch, but the name is now used for a whole range of wines of various origins. When it was created, the label was designed as a consumer-friendly alternative to the innumerable German wine labels with Gothic script and long, complicated names. With the creation of its UK office in 1927, Sichel targeted the export market. Beginning in the 1950s, Blue Nun was advertised as a wine that could be drunk throughout an entire meal, thereby eliminating the often intimidating problem of wine and food pairing. Blue Nun can be said to have been the first wine to have been produced and effectively marketed with an international mass market in mind. After World War II, the brand became spectacularly popular in the United Kingdom and the United States, selling for the same price as a second growth red Bordeaux wine. At its peak of popularity in 1984–1985, annual sales in the U.S. were 1.25 million cases, with another 750,000 cases sold in other markets. During the 1970s in the U.S., a series of radio adverts promoting the wine were produced, featuring Stiller and Meara. Their ads were so effective, they boosted sales by 500%. From the late 1980s, and more so in the 1990s, easy-drinking, semi-sweet German wines began to decline in popularity. Consequently, the brand's popularity declined, and the wine began to be perceived as tacky and dated. This change was reflected in the drink of choice of Alan Partridge, a fictional, over-the-hill British television and radio presenter. However, sales increased after Blue Nun was purchased by the Mosel-based German family firm Langguth, which bought the previous owners Sichel in 1996. They repositioned the brand, reclassifying it from a Liebfraumilch to a regular Qualitätswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete (QbA), changing the grapes from Müller-Thurgau to 30% Riesling, and making it less sweet. It remains relatively low in alcohol at 9.5%."

The character Phil was one of the major introductions made by executive producer Michael Ferguson, who wanted to bring in some macho male leads. Phil and his brother Grant became popularly known as the Mitchell brothers in the British media with Phil initially portrayed as the more level-headed of the two thugs. Storylines featuring the Mitchell family dominated the soap opera throughout the 1990s, with Phil serving as one of the show's central characters and protagonist villains throughout the subsequent decades. McFadden temporarily left the series in late 2003, then returned in April 2005 for a brief appearance before making a permanent return in October 2005. During his time on EastEnders, Phil's most prominent aspects include his battles with alcoholism; sparking numerous feuds; partaking in various criminal activities that sometimes lead to him getting arrested as a result; having occasional relationship problems; being embroiled in multiple family troubles; suffering from cirrhosis of the liver; and bonding with his two children Ben (Charlie Jones/Joshua Pascoe/Harry Reid/Max Bowden) and Louise (Rachel Cox/Brittany Papple/Tilly Keeper). His first major event was a popular love triangle storyline dubbed ""Sharongate"", wherein Phil had an affair with Grant's wife Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) and was subsequently attacked by his brother when the truth was finally revealed; the episode where Grant discovered Phil's affair with Sharon had attracted 25.3 million viewers, thus standing out as a huge ratings winner because of it. The follow-up of Sharongate saw Phil embarking on a problematic marriage with Ben's mother Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth); constantly tormenting Kathy's eldest child Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) over the course of their long-running animosity; having a one-night stand with Ian's ex-wife Mel Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite); escalating his two most competitive rivalries with Mel's husband Steve Owen (Martin Kemp) and their common nemesis Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass); becoming the surrogate father of godson Jamie (Jack Ryder); establishing a companionship with Jamie's estranged uncle Billy (Perry Fenwick); clashing with love rival Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) over Louise's parentage; harbouring resentment against Mark's younger brother Martin Fowler (James Alexandrou) for accidentally killing Jamie in a car accident; teaming up with Sharon's adoptive brother Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) to eliminate their crime boss Jack Dalton (Hywel Bennett) and then cover up the latter's murder; marrying policewoman Kate Morton (Jill Halfpenny) after saving her from Dalton's earlier arrangement to have her killed; crossing paths with Kate's superior DCI Jill Marsden (Sophie Stanton) when she occasionally tries to bring him to justice; being set-up for armed robbery by Sharon and Dennis' illegitimate father Den Watts (Leslie Grantham); helping exonerate Sam for Den's murder after the latter's spouse and killer Chrissie (Tracy-Ann Oberman) frames her for the crime; waging a conflict against Peggy's gangland enemy Johnny Allen (Billy Murray) that culminated in Get Johnny Week; discovering at his wedding to Stella Crawford (Sophie Thompson) that she had been abusing Ben during their relationship; becoming a prime suspect in the murder of his uncle Archie (Larry Lamb); setting fire to The Queen Victoria public house in light of his addiction to crack cocaine; getting shot by ex-lover Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) on the day of his wedding to Sharon; rescuing his two cousins Ronnie (Samantha Womack) and Roxy (Rita Simons) from being murdered by their notorious adversary Nick Cotton (John Altman); framing ex-business partner Max Branning (Jake Wood) for the murder of Ian's daughter Lucy (Hetti Bywater) in the aftermath of her killer being revealed to be Lucy's younger brother Bobby (Eliot Carrington); coping with Peggy's death after she commits suicide to end her cancer endurance; having a child with Denise Fox (Diane Parish); getting hospitalized by Martin's wife Stacey Fowler (Lacey Turner) after threatening to extort money from her closest relative Kat (Jessie Wallace); ending his prolonged marriage to Sharon upon discovering that she had been sleeping with Louise's boyfriend, Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters) and that he is not responsible for her pregnancy as a result of their hidden romance; and being partly responsible for the death of Sharon's son Denny (Harry Hickles/Bleu Landau) after his confrontation with Keanu over the affair had instigated a boat accident that resulted in the younger's death. On 25 December 2020, Phil was later revealed to be the assailant who attacked Ian in the storyline ""Who Attacked Ian Beale?"" Additionally, Phil represented the titular storyline ""Who Shot Phil?"" that saw his character getting shot in a whodunit mystery aired on 1 March 2001. The ensuing speculations progressed up to 5 April 2001 when the shooter was eventually to be Phil's ex-girlfriend and Louise's mother Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin), in an episode that was watched by over 22 million viewers. ""Who Shot Phil?"", which received universal acclaim in light of having captured viewer and media interest, is wildly considered to be one of the best in soap history and among the greatest storylines to have been featured in EastEnders."

"William Henry Butler (24 February 1790 – 11 October 1865) was an English wine merchant and Mayor of Oxford. William Butler was the ninth of the ten children. His parents were James and Jane (née Slatter) Butler from All Saints parish in Oxford. He married Elizabeth Briggs at St Giles' Church, Northampton, on 13 February 1817.

"George Briscoe Kerferd (21 January 1831 – 31 December 1889), Australian colonial politician, was the 10th Premier of Victoria. Kerferd was born in Liverpool, the son of G. B. Kerferd, a merchant (or Joseph Kerferd, a bookkeeper, and his wife Rachel, née Blundell) Kerferd was educated at the Collegiate Institute, Liverpool, with intentions of studying law; however circumstances led him to enter his father's business. Kerferd emigrated to Victoria in 1853 with plans to open a branch of the family business, but this did not eventuate. After trying his luck as a gold miner at Bendigo, he settled in Beechworth and became a brewer and wine merchant. He was mayor of Beechworth 1863-64 and three other occasions. In 1853 he married Ann Martindale, with whom he had ten children. Kerferd was admitted to the Melbourne bar in 1867 but did not practise as a lawyer. Kerferd was elected to the Legislative Assembly for the Ovens in November 1864, and represented the area continuously until February 1886. He began studying law in 1864 and was Minister for Mines and Vice-President of the Board of Land and Works in the government of James McCulloch 1868, and Solicitor-General 1872–1874, and Attorney-General in 1874 in the government of James Francis. When the Francis government was defeated in July 1874, Kerferd succeeded him at the head of a new conservative ministry. Kerferd's Treasurer, James Service, was, like most colonial conservatives, a convinced free trader, and the government's 1875 budget proposed repealing the tariffs imposed by Charles Gavan Duffy's liberal government, and replacing the lost revenue with a land tax and a tax on beer and spirits. But this offended both the landowners and the business community, and Kerferd's government was defeated in August 1875. Kerferd was again appointed as Attorney-General in later conservative governments (1875–1877, 1880 and 1883–86, in the Service government). In 1883 Kerferd was a Victorian representative to the federal convention. In 1886, he quit politics and on 1 January 1886 was appointed to the Supreme Court of Victoria. The appointment was not without controversy as several barristers had served longer in the legal profession, but Kerferd had eight years as attorney-general. There was general agreement that Kerferd filled his role as judge with great ability. Kerferd served as a judge until his death in 1889 while on a holiday at Sorrento, Victoria. Kerferd Road in Albert Park is named after him.Kerferd Road, later Avenue, in Sorrento is also named after him."

"Cane Ashby is a fictional character from the American CBS soap opera The Young and the Restless. He is portrayed by Australian actor Daniel Goddard, who originally auditioned for Brad Snyder on As the World Turns but was recommended for a role on The Young and the Restless instead. The role was to be portrayed as an American, but Goddard's Australian descent influenced the character's background. Former head writer Lynn Marie Latham introduced him during the episode airing on January 12, 2007 as an Australian bartender in search of his family. Latham created Cane as the son of Phillip Chancellor II (Donnelly Rhodes) and Jill Abbott (Jess Walton) but the character's background was rewritten by Maria Arena Bell in 2009, re-establishing him as the son of Colin and Genevieve Atkinson (Tristan Rogers and Genie Francis). Though characterized as ""mysterious"", Cane is ""loyal and dedicated"", while Goddard described the character as a ""typical Australian, working-class kind of guy"". He was the first member of the Atkinson family to appear on the series, followed by his parents and identical twin brother. Soon after his debut, he became a leading character, a decision praised by viewers and critics. The character has been involved with Amber Moore (Adrienne Frantz), Chloe Mitchell (Elizabeth Hendrickson) and most notably Lily Winters (Christel Khalil), a romance that garnered significant fan attention. In 2009, Cane and Lily were married; Global BC would later call Lily the love of Cane's life. The pair had two children, Charlie and Mattie Ashby. In 2011, Goddard was fired from the role, and Cane was shot to death onscreen. However, the actor was rehired soon after viewers campaigned for his return, revealing that Cane's identical twin brother was in fact the man who died. Cane's marriage to Lily was sacrificed, however, they later remarried on Valentine's Day in 2012.

He was the head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles from 1976 to 1982, the St. Louis Rams from 1997 to 1999, and the Kansas City Chiefs from 2001 to 2005. Prior to the NFL, he was the head football coach at Hillsdale High School from 1960 to 1962, Napa Junior College in 1964, and UCLA from 1974 to 1975. With UCLA, Vermeil led the team to victory in the 1976 Rose Bowl. Vermeil's NFL tenure would see him improve the fortunes of teams that had a losing record before he arrived and bring them all to the playoffs by his third season, which included a Super Bowl title with the Rams. Becoming Philadelphia's head coach in 1976, Vermeil took over for a team that had not qualified for the postseason, won a playoff game, or clinched their division since 1960. He ended each of these droughts between 1978 and 1980 en route to the Eagles' first Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl XV. After retiring following the 1982 season, Vermeil spent 15 years away from the NFL until he returned in 1997 with the Rams, who had not achieved a winning season or playoff berth since 1989. Vermeil again ended these droughts during the 1999 season, also obtaining the Rams' first winning season in St. Louis. The season culminated with the Rams winning Super Bowl XXXIV, which was their first Super Bowl victory, their first championship since 1951, and their only NFL title in St. Louis. Vermeil retired a second time following the Super Bowl, but returned with the Chiefs in 2001. During the 2003 season, he guided the Chiefs to their first division title and postseason berth since 1997, although he did not win any playoff games and retired for the final time in 2005. Vermeil holds the distinction of being named Coach of the Year on the high school, junior college, collegiate, and professional levels. He was the Pacific-8 Coach of the Year during UCLA's 1975 championship season, also becoming the first to receive the honor, and the NFL Coach of the Year during the Rams' 1999 championship season. For his NFL accomplishments, Vermeil was inducted to Eagles Hall of Fame in 1994 and the St. Louis Football Ring of Fame in 2008; he is the only coach inducted to the latter."

He is a member of the powerful and wealthy Chandler family, residing at the Chandler Mansion (300 River Road). Adam has been one of Pine Valley's most frequently married characters, but his most significant relationships have been with his sunny-natured autistic twin Stuart, and his long-time business rival Palmer Cortlandt; although the feud quieted down when Palmer's appearances within the show significantly decreased. Five of Adam's eight children have survived into adulthood; Skye Chandler Quartermaine, Hayley Vaughan Santos, JR Chandler, Miguel Reyes, and Colby Chandler. Through them, he has three grandchildren; Lila Rae Alcazar (Skye's daughter), Enzo Santos (Hayley's son), and AJ Chandler (JR's son). Alcoholism seems to run in the Chandler family, affecting Skye, Hayley and JR; Colby briefly followed the same path. His son JR was estranged from Adam because of his marriage to Annie Novak, and he started an affair with Annie to break up his father's marriage.

After leaving town, Adam had his attorney and another ex-wife, Liza, serve Annie divorce papers. Recognized beyond fiction, Adam has been cited by scholars as one of the ""most powerful male figures in television,"" as well as one of its most complex villains, said to ""combine ruthlessness in business and love with wit and sometimes true tenderness."""

"Păstorel Teodoreanu, or just Păstorel (born Alexandru Osvald (Al. O.) Teodoreanu; July 30, 1894 – March 17, 1964), was a Romanian humorist, poet and gastronome, the brother of novelist Ionel Teodoreanu and brother in law of writer Ștefana Velisar Teodoreanu. He worked in many genres, but is best remembered for his parody texts and his epigrams, and less so for his Symbolist verse. His roots planted in the regional culture of Western Moldavia, which became his main source of literary inspiration, Păstorel was at once an opinionated columnist, famous wine-drinking bohemian, and decorated war hero. He worked with the influential literary magazines of the 1920s, moving between Gândirea and Viața Românească, and cultivated complex relationships with literary opinion-makers such as George Călinescu. After an unsuccessful but scandalous debut in drama, Teodoreanu perfected his work as a satirist, producing material which targeted the historian-politician Nicolae Iorga and the literary scholar , as well as food criticism which veered into fantasy literature. As an affiliate of , he favored a brand of Romanian nationalism which ran against Iorga's own. Corrosive or contemplative, Păstorel's various sketches dealt with social and political issues of the interwar, continuing in some ways the work of Ion Luca Caragiale. In the 1930s, inspired by his readings from Anatole France and François Rabelais, he also published his celebrated ""Jewster Harrow"" stories, mocking the conventions of historical novels and Renaissance literature. His career peaked in 1937, when he received one of Romania's most prestigious awards, the National Prize. Teodoreanu was employed as a propagandist during World War II, supporting Romania's participation on the Eastern Front. From 1947, Păstorel was marginalized and closely supervised by the communist regime, making efforts to adapt his style and politics, then being driven into an ambiguous relationship with the Securitate secret police. Beyond this facade conformity, he contributed to the emergence of an underground, largely oral, anti-communist literature. In 1959, Teodoreanu was apprehended by the communist authorities, and prosecuted in a larger show trial of Romanian intellectual resistants. He spent some two years in prison, and reemerged as a conventional writer. He died shortly after, without having been fully rehabilitated. His work was largely inaccessible to readers until the 1989 Revolution."

"Francis Ford Coppola (/ˈkɒpələ/; Italian: [ˈkɔppola]; born April 7, 1939) is an American film director, producer, and screenwriter. He was a central figure in the New Hollywood filmmaking movement of the 1960s and 1970s. His accolades include five Academy Awards, six Golden Globe Awards, two Palmes d'Or, and a British Academy Film Award. After directing The Rain People in 1969, Coppola co-wrote Patton (1970), earning the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay along with Edmund H. North. Coppola's reputation as a filmmaker was cemented with the release of The Godfather (1972). The film revolutionized movie-making in the gangster genre and was adored by the public and critics alike. The Godfather won three Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay (shared with Mario Puzo). The Godfather Part II, which followed in 1974, became the first sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Highly regarded by critics, the film brought Coppola three more Academy Awards: Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Picture, and made him the second director (after Billy Wilder) to be so honored three times for the same film. The Conversation, which Coppola directed, produced and wrote, was released that same year, winning the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. His next film, Apocalypse Now (1979), which notoriously had a lengthy and strenuous production, was widely acclaimed for its vivid depiction of the Vietnam War. The film won the Palme d'Or, making Coppola one of only eight filmmakers to have won that award twice. His best-known films released since the start of the 1980s are the dramas The Outsiders and Rumble Fish (both 1983), the crime dramas The Cotton Club (1984) and The Godfather Part III (1990), and the romantic-horror film Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992) based on the novel of the same name. A number of Coppola's relatives and children have become famous actors and filmmakers in their own right: his sister is the actress Talia Shire, his daughter Sofia Coppola and granddaughter Gia Coppola are directors, and the actors Jason Schwartzman and Nicolas Cage are his nephews.

"Adhémar F. de Chaunac (born 1896) was a French-born Canadian wine pioneer who helped lay the groundwork for a successful wine industry in Ontario and other eastern North American wine regions. He was born in 1896 in southwestern France, and immigrated to Canada in 1907. He temporarily returned to France to serve in the French army during World War I between 1915 and 1919.

Promoted to director of research in 1944, he served in this capacity until he retired in 1961. Alongside viticulturalist , he was to have a major impact on the long term prospects of the North American wine industry. In 1946, de Chaunac was responsible for the introduction to Canada of 35 French hybrid grapevines. Prior to the use of these varieties, wines in eastern North America were typically made with ""foxy"" native North American varieties like Concord or Niagara. The use of French hybrid varieties allowed for a more neutral flavour profile for wine production while still providing tolerances to climatic, soil, and disease conditions that made the use of traditional Vitis vinifera varieties impossible in North American viticulture at that time. It was Adhemar de Chaunac, along with who first tested the use of Vidal blanc for the production of icewine. Vidal is now the most common ice wine grape in Ontario, producing icewines which are a successful export product and routinely win international competitions. Marechal Foch (Kuhlmann 188-2), De Chaunac (Seibel 9549), Baco noir, and Leon Millot are some of the successful hybrids introduced by de Chaunac. While vitis vinifera varieties have ultimately supplanted the majority of French hybrid plantings in eastern North America, hundreds of hectares remain in production, some even used to produce ""cult wines"" from old vine plantings. The De Chaunac (Seibel 9549) grape variety, still grown in some northeastern wine regions, was named after Adhemar de Chaunac."

After having completed his studies, he moved to San Francisco in 1967 to take up a position in management consulting. There, he became acquainted with Napa Valley wines, at a time when California wine had not reached national popularity, but was primarily consumed on the west coast. Several business trips to Europe also offered him opportunities to become acquainted with French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish wine regions. His first opportunity to try his hand on wine criticism came in 1970, when San Francisco wine merchant company Esquin's asked him to evaluate the 1969 Bordeaux vintage, since Esquin's was uncertain whether to buy the wines en primeur. After tasting the unbottled wines from cask, Finigan was unimpressed and advised against buying, and it turned out that this evaluation was later reflected in other critics' evaluations of the vintage."

It defined a new generation of California winemakers as those with ""an enthusiasm for lessons learned from the Old World, but not the desire to replicate its wines; a mandate to seek out new grape varieties and regions; and, perhaps most important, an ardent belief that place matters."" The New California Wine was generally well received. The New York Times wrote that ""Mr. Bonné has been positioned perfectly to observe the profound pendulum swing in style and attitude that has occurred among California winemakers over the last decade."" In the Financial Times, Jancis Robinson wrote that the types of wines in the book ""presented a completely different and refreshing face of America’s wine state.""

"Chunche (Uyghur:چۈنچە, Чунчә; Chinese: 晾房, 阴房) is a Uyghur word that refers to a kind of building used to make raisins in Turpan, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China. The building has a dark interior, and the walls are covered with a large number of holes to allow wind to pass through and assist in the drying process through evaporation. Chunches are usually built in high, windy, areas due to the need for the wind. These structures have long attracted attention of visitors to Turpan. The 19th-century Russian traveler, Grigory Grum-Grshimailo, wrote of Turpan: Turfan is famous for its raisins, which one can deem to be the best in the world. They are dried in drying houses of a completely peculiar type. In Turpan, raisins are primarily produced from seedless white grapes.The drying process takes about 40 days. Grapes that have been dried in a drying house (the ""air-dried"" kind) usually appear green or yellow, because of the shade, while grapes dried under direct sun appear dark. Some raisin producers are reported to buy grapes elsewhere (e.g. in Hami) and bring them to Turpan to dry in the local chunche, as this drying method is believed to produce a superior product. For 2009/2010, China's annual raisin production was forecasted by international expert at 155,000 metric tons (the largest in the world), of which 75% would come from Turpan."

He served as New England's starting quarterback from 1993 to 2001 and was considered the face of the Patriots franchise during his nine seasons with the team. The first overall pick in the 1993 NFL Draft, Bledsoe helped improve the fortunes of the Patriots, who had fallen on hard times. During his tenure as starting quarterback, the Patriots ended a seven-year postseason drought, qualified for the playoffs four times, and made one Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl XXXI. He was also named to three Pro Bowls and became the youngest quarterback to play in the NFL's all-star game at the time with his 1995 appearance. Following a period of declining success and two consecutive seasons where the Patriots missed the playoffs, Bledsoe suffered a near-fatal injury early in the 2001 season that led to backup Tom Brady becoming the team's starter. He was unable to regain his starting position for the remainder of the season due to Brady's success, which led to the Patriots winning their first championship in Super Bowl XXXVI and began a dynasty for the franchise. Bledsoe subsequently played three seasons with the Buffalo Bills, where he made a fourth Pro Bowl appearance, and two with the Dallas Cowboys, before retiring during the 2007 offseason.

"Allen Meadows is an American wine critic and publisher of the Burghound.com quarterly newsletter and website. He was a financial executive and private wine collector until a profile published in Wine Spectator in 1997 led him to decide to follow his passion for wine. By 2000, Meadows had left his role of CFO at a publicly traded insurance company and launched the Burghound.com site, which offers subscribers newsletters with reviews of Burgundy wine and California and Oregon Pinot noir wines. Meadows also regularly speaks on Burgundy and other wine subjects. Burghound.com also organizes wine events such as the Asia Symphony of Wine and Flavours - Burghound in Asia, which is held in Singapore. Within a relatively short time following its launch, and despite a relatively high cost of subscription, the service came to be viewed by many as ""the definitive word on matters Burgundian"", and Meadows ""a leading Burgundy critic"". Among the reasons cited for the success of Burghound.com are that Meadows already held a strong online discussion-group reputation, and that Robert Parker had ceased to cover Burgundy for The Wine Advocate in 1996, and delegated coverage of the region to Pierre Rovani with limited success, providing an opening for Meadows. As Parker already had strained relations with the Burgundy wine community, wine critics of global coverage such as Stephen Tanzer and Clive Coates were perceived to dominate the field. It has been suggested that the Burghound coverage of the 2005 vintage of Burgundy did as much to Meadows' reputation as 1982 Bordeaux did for Robert Parker. In 2010, Meadows and his wife Erica self-published a book entitled The Pearl of the Côte on the subject of the history and vineyards of Vosne-Romanée, while opting not to list the book on channels such as Amazon.com."

"Robert Palmer (July 16, 1934 – January 16, 2009) was an American advertising executive who became a vintner and one of the pioneering developers of the wine industry on the North Fork of New York's Long Island. He was born Robert Joseph Prignano on July 16, 1934 in Forest Hills, Queens. He adopted the surname Palmer when he started working as he felt people found it too hard to spell. He went to school in Queens Village, Queens and attended Chaminade High School in Mineola, New York. He did not attend college and started employment in the advertising industry in his early teens.

His company was one of the first to export wine grown on Long Island internationally. His wines have been served on American Airlines and at restaurants from California to Walt Disney World to Gallagher's Steak House in Manhattan, where it is served as the house wine. Despite a personal preference for martinis, Palmer would taste all of his own wines and exercise final approval on his products, but did not otherwise prefer to drink wine. He had been impressed with people who could accurately identify wines while blindfolded by vineyard and a vintage, which led him to pursue wine tasting as a hobby. Palmer died at age 74 on January 16, 2009 of a blood infection. He was survived by the former Lorraine Wittmer, his wife of 50 years, four daughters and three grandsons."

"Cyril J J Berry (1918 – 4 November 2002), widely cited as CJJ Berry, is best known as the author of the popular book First Steps in Winemaking, which has sold more than three million copies worldwide. Throughout the first half of the 20th century, homebrewing in Britain was limited by taxation, prohibition, and scarcity of ingredients during wartime. One of the earliest modern attempts to regulate private production was the Inland Revenue Act of 1880 in the United Kingdom; this required a 5-shilling homebrewing licence. In the UK, in April 1963, the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, Reggie Maudling removed the need for the 1880 brewing licence. Following the end of sugar rationing in 1953 after the Second World War, and the repeal of the brewing licence, interest in brewing at home started to thrive. Berry was instrumental in this phenomenon as one of the founders of the first British amateur winemakers' circle in Andover, Hampshire and three other English counties in the 1950s. The movement grew quickly from these beginnings. By 1960 there were 86 known wine circles in the UK and over 100 by 1961. A 1962 estimate of membership put numbers at 30,000 in the UK alone. There are now hundreds of wine circles throughout the country and even virtual wine circles with online chat sessions and organised tastings. Berry was one of the founders of the National Association of Winemakers (UK) and served as its first chairman from 1960 to 1967. In 1963 he was instrumental in establishing the Winemaking National Guild of Judges (now National Guild of Wine and Beer Judges) and was one of its early chairmen. Berry also produced the Amateur Winemaker magazine and published First Steps in Winemaking, 130 New Winemaking recipes, and Home Brewed Beers and Stouts. First Steps in Winemaking is notable as a resource for winemaking technique and recipe, and is still in print following its original publication in 1960. It includes methods for traditional grape wines, as well as ""country wines"" using seasonal fruit and vegetables, tinned and dried ingredients, and commercial juices. It is the source for the simplest common method for measuring alcohol by volume in wine: 
* Prior to his retirement in 1967, Berry worked as a newspaper editor, most notably for the Andover Advertiser. Berry served as mayor of Andover in 1972–73. He was an alumnus of the Andover Grammar School and published Old Andover, ISBN 978-0-900841-46-0, a collection of local photos and records dating from 1840 to 1960. Berry died in Nerja, Spain, in 2002."
Ottavio Ottavi (15 August 1849 – 12 January 1893) was an Italian oenologist.
"Abū Isḥāq Ibrāhīm ibn al-Qāsim ar-Raqīq al-Qayrawānī (Arabic: أبو إسحاق ابراهيم ابن القاسم الرقيق القيرواني‎) known as Ibn ar-Raqīq or even just as ar-Raqīq, 11th century courtier and author (d. after 1027-8) in the court of the Zirids in Ifriqiya. ar-Raqiq served as Secretary to two Zirid princes for over a quarter of a century and gained a reputation as a diplomat, poet and historian. He enjoyed wine, women and song, and in fact wrote treatises on each of those subjects. His work on the enjoyment of wine (Quṭb as-Surūr) is the only one of his prose works to survive in its entirety, but Yaqut has preserved some of his poems. The following is a few lines from one: And at the convent of al-Quṣayr, what nights have I passed not knowingMorning from evening, without ever waking from drunkenness!An innocent virgin presents me with nectarAs soon as the bell chimes at dawn.Slender Christian beauty, at her slightest movementHer waist slays me, so slim in size! He wrote a history of North Africa (Tārīkh Ifriqiyya wal-Maghrib) which enjoyed a very high reputation, and was quoted from by later authors such as Ibn Idhari, Ibn Khaldun and Al-Nuwayri. This is fortunate, as the complete work is now lost. In 1965, a Tunisian scholar working in Morocco discovered a manuscript which he believed might be a small part of ar-Raqiq's Tarikh, dealing with the Umayyad conquest of North Africa. This was rushed into print by someone else who got hold of a photocopy and published it as definitely the work of ar-Raqiq. This has been the cause of controversy. Tunisian historian Mohamed Talbi stated that he believed it to be the work of a later anonymous compilator who used ar-Raqiq as well as later historians as a source. The work itself (unlike many contemporary histories) contains no indication of who wrote it, and is very fragmentary. According to Talbi (1971), the style does not display the refinement expected of someone like ar-Raqiq. There are also anachronisms. Nevertheless, many modern historians quote the work as being of ar-Raqiq when forced to use it from lack of other sources. A further controversy erupted between Tunisian historians Talbi and H.R. Idris when the latter criticised Talbi's article on ar-Raqīq in the Encyclopaedia of Islam. Apart from the authorship of the published fragment of the Tārīkh, Idris also took issue with the description of ar-Raqīq as having 'Shi'ite sympathies'. The argument raged over several papers in the journal Arabica in the early 1970s."

"Peter Max F. Sichel (born September 12, 1922) is a German-American wine merchant and former operative of US secret services, who created the success of the Blue Nun wine brand, for a while the largest international wine brand in the world. Prior to this he ran the CIA's operations in Berlin during the early stages of the Cold War. He was born in Mainz in 1922 in to a Jewish family, where his grandfather's family wine business, H. Sichel Söhne had been established. He was educated in Germany and then in 1935 was sent to be educated in England. He was at St Cyprian's School and Stowe School. While he was at school in England, his parents escaped from Nazi Germany on a ruse, and the family settled in France. The firm had offices in London and Bordeaux, and at the start of World War II, while he was apprenticed to the Bordeaux firm, he was interned as he was German. He escaped to the USA via Spain and worked as a US Office of Strategic Services, running agents in Germany for which he was given the Distinguished Intelligence Medal. Shortly after the War, he was sent to Berlin to head the secret Strategic Services Unit. He reported in early 1946 on the methods the Soviets were using to control the political parties in the Russian sector of Germany (which became East Germany). Sichel continued to work for the Central Intelligence Agency in Berlin, Washington and Hong Kong until 1960, when he left, saying ""I left because the CIA did things I didn’t like, such as send people into the Ukraine to work in fabricated resistance groups. They were potentially being sent to their deaths. I made a huge fuss."" He took over the family wine import business in New York, which he dissolved, instead dealing with Schieffelin, then a large drinks company. At this time, wine was taking off as a drink in America, overtaking fortified wine, and he advertised Blue Nun as a wine you can drink ""right through the meal"", using widespread advertising. At its peak in the 1980s, annual sales in the US reached 1.25 million cases. Sichel has often appeared on television in Germany as a witness to the immediate post-war years in Berlin when he was head of the CIA in Berlin, and wrote several books on German wine and a guide to wine. He became chairman of the German parent company in 1984. By the 1990s, the Sichel company was sold to another German company, Langguth, and Peter had arranged sale of part of the Schieffelin company to LVMH.

"Bartolo Mascarello (1927 – March 12, 2005) was an Italian winemaker most known for producing Barolo wine. Bartolo joined the family firm, Cantina Mascarello, in 1945 and learned winemaking from his father, Giulio, who in turn had been trained by his father, Bartolomeo. Mascarello spent most of his life tending four small vineyards in prime locations: Cannubi, San Lorenzo and Rué in Barolo, and Rocche in La Morra. He favoured the old-school practice of blending from those four plots, instead of single-vineyard bottlings.A teenage partisan during WWII, he was dubbed, together with fellow producers Teobaldo Cappellano and Giuseppe Rinaldi, ‘the Last of the Mohicans’ for his dogged refusal to let traditions die. For years, Mascarello's unyielding stance branded him as a has-been among some of his peers and Italian wine critics. In the late 1980s and early 1990s international and Italian critics launched an assault on traditional Barolos in favor of dark wines with coffee and vanilla sensations derived from aging in new barriques. Mascarello became the denomination’s guardian of traditional Barolo, as he clung tenaciously to the methods taught to him by his forebears. The producer – who deplored the shift from large Slavonian casks to small French oak barriques – even created a special hand-painted ""No Barrique, No Berlusconi"" label. He explained: ""No Barrique, because I am against the use of barriques in Barolo – I am a traditional producer. No Berlusconi because I don't like his type of politics."" The original hand-painted labels are now a much sought-after collectors’ item.Mascarello, who had a loyal core of customers from around the world throughout his career, also started to receive critical acclaim. The Italian wine world was shocked and thrilled when his wine received recognition in 2002 by the leading Italian wine guide, reversing years of criticism. Ironic and witty, he declared shortly before his death: ""As the time came to change oak casks I made sure that every corner of the cellar was filled, so that when I die there would be no room for barriques"". After his death his daughter Maria Teresa took over running of the winery, following her father’s traditional methods. She eschews marketing or promotion and does not have a website."

"Kosher wine (Hebrew: יין כשר, yayin kashér) is grape wine produced according to Judaism's religious law, specifically, Jewish dietary laws (kashrut). To be considered kosher, Sabbath-observant Jews must supervise and sometimes handle the entire winemaking process, from the time the grapes are crushed until the wine is bottled and any ingredients used, including finings, must be kosher. Wine that is described as ""kosher for Passover"" must have been kept free from contact with chametz, examples being grain, bread and dough. When kosher wine is produced, marketed and sold commercially, it would normally have a hechsher (""seal of approval"") of a kosher certification agency, or of an authoritative rabbi who is preferably also a posek (""decisor"" of Jewish law), or be supervised by a beth din (""Jewish religious court of law""). In recent times, there has been an increased demand for kosher wines and a number of wine producing countries now produce a wide variety of sophisticated kosher wines under strict rabbinical supervision, particularly in Israel, the United States, France, Germany, Italy, South Africa, Chile and Australia. Two of the world's largest producers and importers of kosher wines, Kedem and Manischewitz, are both based in the Northeastern United States."
"Vitis (grapevines) is a genus of 79 accepted species of vining plants in the flowering plant family Vitaceae. The genus is made up of species predominantly from the Northern hemisphere. It is economically important as the source of grapes, both for direct consumption of the fruit and for fermentation to produce wine. The study and cultivation of grapevines is called viticulture. Most Vitis varieties are wind-pollinated with hermaphroditic flowers containing both male and female reproductive structures. These flowers are grouped in bunches called inflorescences. In many species, such as Vitis vinifera, each successfully pollinated flower becomes a grape berry with the inflorescence turning into a cluster of grapes. While the flowers of the grapevines are usually very small, the berries are often large and brightly colored with sweet flavors that attract birds and other animals to disperse the seeds contained within the berries. Grapevines usually only produce fruit on shoots that came from buds that were developed during the previous growing season. In viticulture, this is one of the principles behind pruning the previous year's growth (or ""One year old wood"") that includes shoots that have turned hard and woody during the winter (after harvest in commercial viticulture). These vines will be pruned either into a cane which will support 8 to 15 buds or to a smaller spur which holds 2 to 3 buds."
"Kabinett (literal meaning: cabinet), or sometimes Kabinettwein (literal meaning: a wine set aside in a cabinet), is a German language wine term for a wine which is made from fully ripened grapes of the main harvest, typically picked in September, and are usually made in a light style. In the German wine classification system, Kabinett is the lowest level of Prädikatswein, lower in ripeness than Spätlese. In Austria, Kabinett is subcategory of Qualitätswein rather than a Prädikatswein, and the term always designates a dry wine. In the Czech Republic, Kabinet is a category of Quality Wine with Predicate (Czech: Jakostní víno s přívlastkem). Wines of this style are usually light and dry."
"Beerenauslese (literal meaning: ""selected harvest of berries"") is a German language wine term for a late harvest wine. Beerenauslese is a category in the Prädikatswein category of the Austrian and German wine classifications, and is a category above Auslese. Beerenauslese wines, often called ""BA"" for short, are usually made from grapes affected by noble rot, that is ""botrytized"" grapes. The grapes for Beerenauslese wines are those that have been individually picked. These wines are typically very sweet and rich, and most age very well. The finest Beerenauslese wines are generally considered to be made from the Riesling grape variety, as this retains significant acidity even with the extreme ripeness, which results in a wine where the sweetness is balanced and which has great longevity and which often will improve for decades. These wines are produced in very small quantities when the weather is suitable for the noble rot to form and only in vineyards with appropriate conditions, so they tend to be very expensive. An exception to this is Beerenauslesen produced from more easily ripening grapes such as Ortega or Huxelrebe which have extremely high sugar content, but less noble rot character and less acidity, and therefore tends to come across as less elegant and usually without the potential to improve with cellaring. In Alsace, the term most closely corresponding to Beerenauslese is Sélection de Grains Nobles."
"Auslese (literal meaning: ""selected harvest""; plural form is Auslesen) is a German language wine term for a late harvest wine and is a riper category than Spätlese in the Prädikatswein category of the Austrian and German wine classification. The grapes are picked from selected very ripe bunches in the autumn (late November-early December), and have to be hand-picked. Generally Auslese wine can be made in only the best harvest years that have been sufficiently warm. A small proportion of the grapes may be affected by noble rot in some regions although this never dominates the character of the wine. Rheingau winemaker Schloss Johannisberg is generally credited with discovering Auslese wine in 1787. Auslesen are sometimes considered a German dessert wine, especially the wines made from botrytis infected bunches, though it is not as sweet as Eiswein, Beerenauslese (BA), or Trockenbeerenauslese (TBA) dessert wines. Auslesen can be enjoyed by themselves (aperitif – an ""afternoon wine"") but are usually best accompanied with food, particularly those that exhibit the hearty characteristics of German cuisine. The term in Alsace most closely corresponding to Auslese in terms of must weight requirements is Vendange tardive, even though this French term is linguistically equivalent to the German term Spätlese."
"Spätlese (literal meaning: ""late harvest""; plural form is Spätlesen) is a German wine term for a wine from fully ripe grapes, the lightest of the late harvest wines. Spätlese is a riper category than Kabinett in the Prädikatswein category of the German wine classification and is the lowest level of Prädikatswein in Austria, where Kabinett is classified in another way. In both cases, Spätlese is below Auslese in terms of ripeness. The grapes are picked at least seven days after normal harvest, so they are riper and have a higher sugar content. Because of the weather, waiting to pick the grapes later carries a risk of the crop being ruined by rain. However, in warm years and from good sites much of the harvest will reach Spätlese level. The wines may be either sweet or dry; it is a level of ripeness that particularly suits rich dry wines from Riesling, Weißer Burgunder, and Grauer Burgunder grapes for example, as at Auslese levels the alcohol levels may become very high in a dry wine, leaving the wine unbalanced, making wines with at least some residual sweetness preferable to most palates. However, most German wines are traditionally dry, and the amount of sugar is not the only factor balancing a wine. Dry German wines can be very balanced, and usually get higher ratings from German wine journalists than a comparable wine with more sugar. Many Spätlese wines will age well, especially those made from the Riesling grape."
"Lake County wine is an appellation that designates wine made from grapes grown mostly in Lake County, California and located north of Napa County. Although each region within Lake County has unique viticultural attributes, all are influenced by Clear Lake, the largest inland body of water in California.

"Frederick Henry Browning CBE (1 August 1870 – 13 October 1929) was an English first-class cricketer, rackets player and British Army officer. The son of Montague Charles Browning, he was born at Bury St Edmunds in August 1870. He was educated at Wellington College, where he played with some success for the college cricket eleven.

He left Oxford without completing his degree, choosing instead to become a wine merchant, shortly thereafter joining the family firm Twiss & Brownings, whose main important was Hennessy. He became a senior partner in 1905 and formed a close friendship with the Hennessy family. He continued to play rackets at amateur level and was considered the best amateur player of his generation, winning the Amateur Doubles Championship in 1893 with Harry Foster and in 1895 with Francis Dames-Longworth. Browning was a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the Free Foresters and I Zingari, serving on the committee of the latter two. He toured North America with the MCC in September 1907, playing two first-class matches against the Gentlemen of Philadelphia, before making a third first-class appearance against the Gentlemen of Philadelphia during their visit to Lord's in August 1908. His three first-class matches yielded him 38 runs with a highest score of 27. He toured Egypt with I Zingari in 1914, captaining the side.

Among the goods he bought from Del were a hairdryer that was actually a paint stripper (leaving Mike with severe burns to the head), a deep fryer (which soon exploded) and a faulty fax machine. On the other hand, he was quite happy to con people out of their money when he could, evidenced by one occasion where he sold Denzil a plate of beef stew for £1, then sold exactly the same thing to a yuppie for £2.50, instead calling it ""Boeuf Bourguignon."" When Kenneth MacDonald died in 2001, writer John Sullivan added a storyline to new episode ""If They Could See Us Now"", which explained that Mike had been caught up in Del and Rodney's shady financial dealings and attempted to embezzle the brewery in order to cover his losses, for which he was imprisoned. Cafe owner Sid took over Mike's position of landlord. In the 2015 book He Who Dares, a fictional Del Boy autobiography, it is said that Mike's prison sentence had been reduced and he had retired to the Isle of Wight to write a memoir of his time inside. Del had left him a number of messages, but had never received any responses."

"Mr. Dooley (or Martin J. Dooley) is a fictional Irish immigrant bartender created by American journalist Finley Peter Dunne. Dooley was the subject of many Dunne columns between 1893 and 1915, and again in 1924 and 1926. Dunne's essays contain the bartender's commentary on various topics (often national or international affairs). They became extremely popular during the 1898 Spanish–American War and remained so afterwards; they are collected in several books. The essays are in the form of conversations in Irish dialect between Mr. Dooley, who in the columns owns a tavern in the Bridgeport area of Chicago, and one of the fictional bar's patrons (in later years, usually Malachi Hennessy) with most of the column a monologue by Dooley. The pieces are not widely remembered, but originated lasting sayings such as ""the Supreme Court follows the election returns"". Mr. Dooley was invented by Dunne to replace a similar character whose real-life analogue had objected. By having the garrulous bartender speak in dialect and live in an unfashionable area of Chicago Dunne gained a freedom of expression he often did not have in standard English. The first four years of the weekly column made Mr. Dooley popular in Chicago, but little noticed elsewhere. Dunne was a rapidly rising newspaperman, and the pieces mainly appeared in the Chicago paper which he worked for. During that time, Dunne detailed the daily life of Bridgeport through Dooley's lips, painting a portrait of ethnic urban life unparalleled in 19th-century American literature. Dunne's bartender came to wider attention with the wartime columns, and the Dooley pieces were soon in newspapers nationwide. Both the columns and the books collecting them gained national acclaim. Beginning around 1905, Dunne had increasing trouble finding time and inspiration for new columns, and they ended in 1915, except for a brief resurrection in the mid-1920s. Even in Dunne's own time (he died in 1936), his work was becoming obscure in part due to his use of dialect, and the unusual spellings that it required have proved a lasting barrier for potential readers."

"Angelica wine is an historic sweet fortified wine usually from California made typically from the Mission grape. It is often served as a dessert wine. Some varieties consist of the unfermented grape juice fortified with brandy or clear spirit immediately after pressing. Others are made like port, where the only partially fermented wine, still retaining a large amount of sugar, is infused with brandy. The relatively high alcohol of the brandy arrests the fermentation, leaving a fortified wine high in alcohol and high in residual sugar (usually about 10 to 15%). It is typically made from 50% Mission wine and 50% Mission brandy. Angelica dates to the Mission period in California and its name is thought to be taken from the city of Los Angeles. It was produced by the Franciscan missionaries and is one of the first wines made in the state. Several California producers continue to produce Mission-based Angelica. The wine is sometimes made in a simple style and is inexpensive. Some is made with great care from ancient vines and can be quite expensive. Bottles of Angelica as old as 1870 can still be found and show great distinction."
"Straw wine, or raisin wine, is a wine made from grapes that have been dried to concentrate their juice. The result is similar to that of the ice wine process, but is a much older process and suitable for warm climates. The technique dates back to pre-Classical times with wines becoming fashionable in Roman times and in late Medieval/Renaissance Europe when wines such as Malmsey ('Malvasia' originally from Greece) and Candia (from Crete) were highly sought after. Traditionally, most production of these wines has been in Greece, the islands off Sicily, Cyprus, Northern Italy and the French Alps. However producers in other areas are now using with the method too. Under the classic method, after a careful hand harvest, selected bunches of ripe grapes will be laid out on mats in full sun. (Originally the mats were made of straw, but these days the plastic nets for the olive harvest are likely to be used). This drying will probably be done on well exposed terraces somewhere near the wine press and the drying process will take around a week or a little longer. Small scale productions were laid out on flat roofs; however, if this still happens, it is extremely rare nowadays. Under less labour-intensive versions of the technique, easily portable racks might be used instead of mats or nets, or the grapes are left lying on the ground beneath the vines, or even left hanging on the vine with the vine-arm cut or the stem twisted. Technically speaking the grapes must be cut off from the vine in order for the wine to be a 'straw wine'. If the grapes are just left to over-ripen before being harvested, even if this is to the point of raisining, this is a 'late harvest' wine. The exact technique used varies according to local conditions, traditions and increasingly modern innovations. In some regions the grapes are laid first in the sun and later covered or they are covered at night to protect them against dew fall. In cooler, damper regions, the entire drying process takes place indoors in huts, attics or greenhouses with the bunches lying on racks or hanging up with good air circulation. Straw wines are typically sweet to very sweet white wines, similar in density and sweetness to Sauternes but potentially sweeter. They are capable of long ageing. The low yields and labour-intensive production method means that they are quite expensive. Around Verona red grapes are dried, and are fermented in two different ways to make a strong dry red wine (Amarone) and a sweet red wine (Recioto della Valpolicella)."
"Denumire de origine controlată (DOC) is a Romanian language appellation regime in Europe to designate food with a particular origin.

"William Henry Trimmer (c. 1822 – 22 December 1867) was a vigneron and politician in the early colony of South Australia. Trimmer may have arrived in South Australia on the Guiana from London in March 1842. In 1943 he leased farmland on the banks of the Sturt River. Between 1859 and 1861 he planted some 15 acres (6 ha) of grapes at his vineyard. The property, ""Fairford"" in the Adelaide suburb of Sturt on which he built a modest house and wine cellar. He purchased the property from the South Australian Company in 1862. He was a Justice of the Peace and Chairman of the District Council of Brighton 1866–1867. He was a candidate for one of two seats of Noarlunga in the South Australian House of Assembly in 1865, and came a credible third in the contest (John Colton 348, John Carr 303, Trimmer 261), but votes cast at Happy Valley could not be included, as the returns had been signed by the Poll Clerk rather than the Returning Officer. This put Trimmer in second place, thus giving him a seat. His offer to waive any objections could not be accepted, so immediately on taking his seat on 9 March 1865 he resigned in favour of Carr. His last months were made miserable by the effects of delirium tremens, and he took his own life by swallowing a large quantity of laudanum. He left his property to his wife and to Edward Amand Wright, a friend of 20 years. It is likely that Trimmer's cellar building was designed by Edmund Wright, Edward's brother. ""Fairford"" was in 1876 sold to Henry Laffer, hence its colloquial name ""Laffer's Triangle"", now Warriparinga."

"Mouthfeel refers to the physical sensations in the mouth caused by food or drink, as distinct from taste. It is a fundamental sensory attribute which, along with taste and smell, determines the overall flavor of a food item. Mouthfeel is also sometimes referred to as texture. It is used in many areas related to the testing and evaluating of foodstuffs, such as wine-tasting and food rheology. It is evaluated from initial perception on the palate, to first bite, through chewing to swallowing and aftertaste. In wine-tasting, for example, mouthfeel is usually used with a modifier (big, sweet, tannic, chewy, etc.) to the general sensation of the wine in the mouth. Research indicates texture and mouthfeel can also influence satiety with the effect of viscosity most significant. Mouthfeel is often related to a product's water activity—hard or crisp products having lower water activities and soft products having intermediate to high water activities."

"A winemaker or vintner is a person engaged in winemaking. They are generally employed by wineries or wine companies, where their work includes: 
* Cooperating with viticulturists 
* Monitoring the maturity of grapes to ensure their quality and to determine the correct time for harvest 
* Crushing and pressing grapes 
* Monitoring the settling of juice and the fermentation of grape material 
* Filtering the wine to remove remaining solids 
* Testing the quality of wine by tasting 
* Placing filtered wine in casks or tanks for storage and maturation 
* Preparing plans for bottling wine once it has matured 
* Making sure that quality is maintained when the wine is bottled Today, these duties require an increasing amount of scientific knowledge, since laboratory tests are gradually supplementing or replacing traditional methods. Winemakers can also be referred to as oenologists as they study oenology – the science of wine."

"Depending on the province in which it is produced, Cellared in Canada is a category of Canadian wine that is produced with varying quantities of foreign bulk wine and Canadian wine. These wines are often sold in government-run liquor stores in sections designated as ""Canadian wine"". In British Columbia, Cellared in Canada wine may be produced from 100 percent foreign content with grapes grown from Washington State, California, South Africa, Argentina, Chile. and possibly even China.

The only indication of origin is found on the back of the bottle, with a term such as ""Cellared in Canada from international and domestic wines"". Other permitted terms are ""Product of Canada"" and ""Vinted in Canada"". In Ontario, as of April 1, 2014, the wineries which existed prior to 1993 will be allowed to produce ""International - Canadian blends"" which contain no more than 75% foreign content (meaning that they in fact contain only 25% Ontario wine, which may be from labrusca varieties). Historically, this percentage has fluctuated wildly, due to periodic shortages and surpluses of Ontario grapes, and lobbying by both the grape growers and the producers."
"Grower Champagnes are Champagnes produced by the estate that owns the vineyards where the grapes are grown. Récoltant-Manipulant is the term in French, and Grower Champagnes can be identified by ""RM"" on the wine label. While large Champagne houses such as Mumm, Moët et Chandon and Veuve Clicquot may use grapes from as many as 80 different vineyards in the Champagne region to create a consistent house style, Grower Champagnes tend to be more terroir-focused, sourced from a single vineyard or closely located vineyards around a village, and made with grapes which vary with each vintage. Today there are over 19,000 independent growers in the Champagne region, accounting for nearly 88% of vineyard land in the region; around 5,000 of these growers produce wine from their own grapes. Of the Champagne imported into the US in 2014, only 5% was Grower Champagne."

She married Joe Ah Chan, who emigrated to New Zealand in around 1905, but remained in China while he established himself in New Zealand. Kue Sum went to a private tutor in her village to study English, as at the time immigrants were required to pass a literacy test of 100 English words in order to enter New Zealand. She was able to pass the test and moved to New Zealand in 1920. Her husband had opened a general store at Matamata in the North Island, and Kue Sum ran the store together with him. Two years later, the couple moved to Thames and opened a fruit shop and market garden, and in 1924 they leased land for a vineyard and opened Goldleaf Vineyard. In 1935 they expanded to a second vineyard under the same name. As Ah Chan was frequently away from the vineyard for months at a time, Kue Sum was responsible for leading and managing the workers who picked, wrapped and packed the grapes for transportation. She was also responsible for the security of the vineyard, as burglars frequently broke in to steal grapes from the vines. She used an Alsatian watchdog to keep watch, and a broom as her weapon. Ah Chan was known in the local community for her generosity and hospitality. During the Depression she gave work to some of the many desperate people who came to the vineyard seeking employment, and was also a host to the other Chinese market gardeners in the area.

"An appellation is a legally defined and protected geographical indication primarily used to identify where the grapes for a wine were grown, although other types of food often have appellations as well. Restrictions other than geographical boundaries, such as what grapes may be grown, maximum grape yields, alcohol level, and other quality factors may also apply before an appellation name may legally appear on a wine bottle label. The rules that govern appellations are dependent on the country in which the wine was produced."
"The subjective sweetness of a wine is determined by the interaction of several factors, including the amount of sugar in the wine, but also the relative levels of alcohol, acids, and tannins. Sugars and alcohol enhance a wine's sweetness; acids (sourness) and bitter tannins counteract it. These principles are outlined in the 1987 work by Émile Peynaud, The Taste of Wine."

"In Spain, the denominación de origen (Spanish pronunciation: [denominaˈθjon de oˈɾixen]; 'designation of origin') is part of a regulatory geographical indication system used primarily for foodstuffs such as cheeses, condiments, honey, and meats, among others. In wines, it parallels the hierarchical systems of France (1935) and Italy (1963), although Rioja (1925) and Jerez (1933) preceded the full system. In foods, it performs a similar role, namely regulation of quality and geographical origin among Spain's finest producers. There are five other designated categories solely for wine and a further three specifically covering food and condiments, all recognised by the European Union (EU). In Catalonia, two further categories – labelled A and Q – cover traditional Catalan artisan food products, but were not recognised by the EU as of 2007. In recent decades, the concept of the denominación de origen has been adopted by other countries, primarily in Latin America. In 2016, the use of the term Denominación de Origen (DO) was changed in many cases for the European Denominación de Origen Protegida (DOP) by the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, but the traditional term of DO can still be used legally on labels."

"Investment wine, like gold bullion, rare coins, fine art, and tulip bulbs, is seen by some as an alternative investment other than the more traditional investment holdings of stocks, bonds, cash, or real estate. While most wine is purchased with the intent of consuming it, some wines are purchased with the intention to resell them at a higher price in the future. A wine's value often goes up as time passes and consumption increases as the market becomes tighter and access to good wine is more elusive."
"Table wine is a wine term with two different meanings: a style of wine and a quality level within wine classification. In the United States, table wine primarily designates a wine style: ordinary wine which is neither fortified, nor sparkling, nor expensive. In the European Union wine regulations, table wine (TW) is the lower of two overall quality categories, the higher of which is Quality Wines Produced in Specified Regions (QWPSR). All levels of national wine classification systems within the EU correspond to either TW or the QWPSR, although the terms that actually appear on wine labels are defined by national wine laws with the EU regulations as a framework. Most EU countries have a national classification called table wine in the country's official language. Examples include vin de table in France, vino da tavola in Italy, vino de mesa in Spain, vinho de mesa in Portugal, Tafelwein in Germany, επιτραπέζιος οίνος (epitrapézios oínos) in Greece. These classifications generally represent the lowest level of classification in their country."

"Minnesota 78 is an old selection of grapevine, developed at the University of Minnesota. It was extensively used in breeding by Elmer Swenson, with its Vitis riparia background providing a degree of adaptation to the harsh climate of the upper Midwest. Although recorded as a cross of Beta by Witt, many have doubted this pedigree, and Swenson suggested that the male parent may be Jessica, a cross of Vitis labrusca by a variety of Vitis aestivalis. Because Witt appears to have been lost, precluding genetic testing, the truth may be known.1"
"The Winkler Vine was an example of large-vine grape culture. The vine was named after Albert J. Winkler, Chair of the Department of Viticulture and Enology (1935–1957) at University of California, Davis. Planted in 1979, the Winkler vine was a Vitis vinifera cv. Mission, grafted on to a Vitis rupestris St George rootstock. A great deal of research has been carried out on pruning, training and vine size; by researchers such as: Ravaz, Winkler, Shaulis, Koblet, Howell, Carbonneau, Smart & Clingeleffer. Minimal pruning is a pruning/training system adapted from the principles of big-vine theory."
"The Rheingau wine region, located in the state of Hesse, is one of the 13 regions (Anbaugebiete) for quality wine in Germany. For each of the quality wine regions, the state where it is located keeps a formal vineyard roll (Weinbergsrolle) which lists all formally recognised vineyards of the region, with detailed surveying maps defining the geographical extent of each vineyard. This list defines which geographical designations may appear on the wine labels under the principles set down by the national wine law. The list includes single vineyard designations (Einzellagen), which are grouped together into collective vineyards (Großlagen). Both single and collective vineyard designations are used together with village names. The state of Hesse lists the following vineyards. The vineyards are listed broadly from east to west, in the downstream direction of river Rhine."
"The Mosel wine region, located almost entirely in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, with a small part in Saarland, is one of the 13 regions (Anbaugebiete) for quality wine in Germany defined in the federal wine legislation. For each of the quality wine regions, the state where the vineyards are located keeps a formal vineyard roll (Weinbergsrolle) which lists all formally recognised vineyards of the region, with detailed surveying maps defining the geographical extent of each vineyard. Thus, the full list of Mosel vineyards in fact consist of separate lists in two German states. These lists defines which geographical designations may appear on the wine labels under the principles set down by the national wine law. The lists includes single vineyard designations (Einzellagen), which are grouped together into collective vineyards (Großlagen). Both single and collective vineyard designations are used together with village names. The state of Rhineland-Palatinate lists the following vineyards. The vineyards are listed by district (Bereich) broadly from west to east, in the downstream direction of the river Moselle."

"This is a list of wineries in South Africa arranged by wine region. A winery is a building or property that produces wine, or a business involved in the production of wine, such as a wine company. Some wine companies own many wineries. Besides wine making equipment, larger wineries may also feature warehouses, bottling lines, laboratories, and large expanses of tanks known as tank farms. 
* Wine producing regions in South Africa include*: Barrydale, Breedekloof, Breede River Valley, Cape Point, Calitzdorp, Constantia, Darling, Durbanville, Elgin, Elim, Franschhoek, Ladismith, Little Karoo, Montagu, , Oudtshoorn, Paarl, Robertson, Stellenbosch, Swartland, Swellendam, Tulbagh, Tygerberg, Wellington and Worcester, and Mosselbay."

"The wines of Graves in the wine-growing region of Bordeaux were classified in 1953 by a jury appointed by Institute National des Appellations d'Origine, and approved by the Minister of Agriculture in August of that year. The selection was revised with a few additions in February 1959. The classification concerns both red and white wines, and all chateaux belong to the appellation Pessac-Léognan, which eventually came into effect on September 9, 1987."
"In 1955, the wines of Saint-Émilion in the wine-growing region of Bordeaux were classified. Unlike the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855 covering wines from the Médoc and Graves regions, the Saint-Émilion list is updated every 10 years or so. Following the initial classification, the list was updated in 1969, 1986, 1996, 2006, and 2012. However the 2006 classification was declared invalid following a series of legal actions, and the 1996 version of the classification has been reinstated for the vintages from 2006 to 2009. The region's Syndicat Viticole started planning for a classification of St.-Émilion wine in 1930, but it was not until October 7, 1954 that the principles behind the classification became official when the INAO agreed to take responsibility for handling the classification. The first list of classified St.-Émilion estates was published on June 16, 1955, and was amended on August 7 and October 18, 1958. The original list contained 12 Premier grands crus classés and 63 Grands crus classés."
"The Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855 resulted from the 1855 Exposition Universelle de Paris, when Emperor Napoleon III requested a classification system for France's best Bordeaux wines that were to be on display for visitors from around the world. Brokers from the wine industry ranked the wines according to a château's reputation and trading price, which at that time was directly related to quality. The wines were ranked in importance from first to fifth growths (crus). All of the red wines that made it on the list came from the Médoc region except for one: Château Haut-Brion from Graves. The white wines, then of much less importance than red wine, were limited to the sweet varieties of Sauternes and Barsac and were ranked only from superior first growth to second growth."
"The classification of wine can be done according to various methods including place of origin or appellation, vinification methods and style, sweetness and vintage, or variety used. Practices vary in different countries and regions of origin, and many practices have varied over time. Some classifications enjoy official protection by being part of the wine law in their country of origin, while others have been created by, for example, grower's organizations without such protection."
"An American Viticultural Area (AVA) is a designated wine grape-growing region in the United States, providing an official appellation for the mutual benefit of wineries and consumers. Winemakers frequently want their consumers to know about the geographic pedigree of their wines, as wines from a particular area can possess distinctive characteristics. Consumers often seek out wines from specific AVAs, and certain wines of particular pedigrees can claim premium prices and loyal customers. If a wine is labeled with an AVA, at least 85% of the grapes that make up the wine must have been grown in the AVA, and the wine must be fully finished in the state where the AVA is located."

"The classification of Champagne vineyards developed in the mid-20th century as a means of setting the price of grapes grown through the villages of the Champagne wine region. Unlike the classification of Bordeaux wine estates or Burgundy Grand cru vineyards, the classification of Champagne is broken down based on what village the vineyards are located in. A percentile system known as the Échelle des Crus (""ladder of growth"") acts as a pro-rata system for determining grape prices. Vineyards located in villages with high rates will receive higher prices for their grapes than vineyards located in villages with a lower rating. While the Échelle des Crus system was originally conceived as a 1-100 point scale, in practice, the lowest rated villages are rated at 80%. Premier crus villages are rated between 90 and 99 percent while the highest rated villages, with 100% ratings are Grand crus."
"The wine regions of South Africa were defined under the ""Wine of Origin"" (Wyn van Oorsprong) act of 1973. Mirroring the French Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) system, all South African wines listing a ""Wine of Origin"" must be composed entirely of grapes from its region. The ""Wine of Origins"" (WO) program mandates how wine regions of South Africa are defined and can appear on wine labels. While some aspects of the WO are taken from the AOC, the WO is primarily concerned with accuracy in labeling. As a result, the WO does not place adjunct regulations on wine regions such as delineating permitted varieties, trellising methods, irrigation techniques, and crop yields. The WO system divides growing regions into four categories. The largest and most generic are Geographical Units (such as the Western Cape region) which subsume the smaller, but still broad spanning Regions (such as ). Under these are clustered districts (like Walker Bay) and within them are wards (such as Elgin). Although these are geographic units, regions and districts are largely traced by political boundaries (wards are the segment most defined by unique, Terroir characteristics)."
"Langton's Classification of Australian Wine is a listing of fine Australian wines compiled by wine-specialist auction house and online merchant Langton's. The Classification is a ranking of the best-performing Australian wines based on secondary market support over a minimum of 10 vintages. It was first published in 1991. The Classification is divided into three categories - Exceptional, Outstanding and Excellent - and new editions have appeared at intervals of approximately five years. The sixth edition was published in May 2014 and includes 139 of Australia's finest wines. Editions of the classification are identified by Roman numerals. Langton's has been owned by Woolworths Limited since 2009, until 2021 when it was spun off with other liquor businesses to make Endeavour Group."
"A fragrance wheel, also known as aroma wheel, fragrance circle, perfume wheel or smell wheel, is a circular diagram showing the inferred relationships among olfactory groups based upon similarities and differences in their odor. The groups bordering one another are implied to share common olfactory characteristics. Fragrance wheel is frequently used as a classification tool in oenology and perfumery. The first example of a fragrance wheel was conceived by Austrian perfumer and titled the Odor Effects Diagram, published in the original German edition of his book The Practice of Modern Perfumery (1949). Other notable versions include the Fragrance Circle, developed in 1979 by U. Harder at Haarman & Reimer, the Wine Aroma Wheel, from 1984 by sensory chemist Ann C. Noble, and the Fragrance Wheel, created in 1992 by perfumery taxonomist Michael Edwards."
"An American Viticultural Area (AVA) is a designated appellation for American wine in the United States distinguishable by geographic, geologic, and climatic features, with boundaries defined by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) of the United States Department of the Treasury. As of August 2021, there are 258 recognized AVAs in 34 states—several of which are shared by two or more states. Over half (142) of the AVAs are in California. American Viticultural Areas range in size from the Upper Mississippi River Valley AVA at 29,900 square miles (77,000 km2) across four states, to the Cole Ranch AVA in Mendocino County, California, at only 62 acres (25 ha). The Augusta AVA near the town of Augusta, Missouri, was the first recognized AVA, gaining the status on June 20, 1980."
"German wine regions are classified according to the quality category of the wine grown therein: Tafelwein, Landwein, Qualitätswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete (QbA) and Prädikatswein. The wine regions allowed to produce QbA and Prädikatswein are further subdivided into four categories according to size: Anbaugebiet (a major wine region), Bereich (a district within the wine region), Großlage (a collection of vineyards within a district) and Einzellage (a single vineyard). A small number of Einzellagen do not belong to a Großlage and are called ""großlagenfrei"", but all belong to a Bereich and Anbaugebiet. The 13 major wine regions (Anbaugebiete) are Ahr, Baden, Franconia, Hessische Bergstraße, Mittelrhein, Mosel, Nahe, Palatinate, Rheingau, Rheinhessen, Saale-Unstrut, Saxony, and Württemberg. With the exceptions of Saxony and Saale-Unstrut, most of Germany's major wine regions are located in the western part of the country. As of 2010, there were 41 Bereiche, 160 Großlagen and 2,632 Einzellagen."
"The aromas of wine are more diverse than its flavors. The human tongue is limited to the primary tastes perceived by taste receptors on the tongue – sourness, bitterness, saltiness, sweetness and savoriness. The wide array of fruit, earthy, leathery, floral, herbal, mineral, and woodsy flavor present in wine are derived from aroma notes sensed by the olfactory bulb. In wine tasting, wine is sometimes smelled before taking a sip in order to identify some components of the wine that may be present. Different terms are used to describe what is being smelled. The most basic term is aroma which generally refers to a ""pleasant"" smell as opposed to odor which refers to an unpleasant smell or possible wine fault. The term aroma may be further distinguished from bouquet which generally refers to the smells that arise from the chemical reactions of fermentation and aging of the wine."
"The use of wine tasting descriptors allows the taster to qualitatively relate the aromas and flavors that the taster experiences and can be used in assessing the overall quality of wine. Wine writers differentiate wine tasters from casual enthusiasts; tasters attempt to give an objective description of the wine's taste (often taking a systematic approach to tasting), casual enthusiasts appreciate wine but pause their examination sooner than tasters. The primary source of a person's ability to taste wine is derived from their olfactory senses. A taster's own personal experiences play a significant role in conceptualizing what they are tasting and attaching a description to that perception. The individual nature of tasting means that descriptors may be perceived differently among various tasters. The following is an incomplete list of wine tasting descriptors and a common meaning of the terms. These terms and usage are from Karen MacNeil's 2001 edition of The Wine Bible unless otherwise noted."
"The German wine classification system puts a strong emphasis on standardization and factual completeness, and was first implemented by the German Wine Law of 1971. Nearly all of Germany's vineyards are delineated and registered as one of approximately 2,600 Einzellagen ('individual sites'), and the produce from any vineyard can be used to make German wine at any quality level, as long as the must weight of the grapes reaches the designated minimum level. As the current German system does not classify vineyards by quality, the measure of wine ’quality’ is the ripeness of the grapes alone. Approximately 200 wine makers have been organised since 1910 in the Verband Deutscher Prädikats- und Qualitätsweingüter (VDP). To counter the shortcomings of the 1971 law, the VDP nowadays classifies the best vineyards by its own rules into 'VDP.Grosse Lage' (Grand cru) and 'VDP.Erste Lage' (Premier cru) based on 19th century Prussian tax maps. Most of these wine makers are based in the regions of Mosel, Pfalz, and Franken. The classification of wines has been reorganized since 1 August 2009 by the EU wine market organization. The traditional German wine classification remained mostly unchanged, as the European system follows the origin-related system like in Germany and most areas of France (AOC). The already existing protection of geographical indication was transmitted through this step as well to the wine classification."
"This list of wine-producing regions catalogues significant growing regions where vineyards are planted. Wine grapes mostly grow between the 30th and the 50th degree of latitude, in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. Grapes will sometimes grow beyond this range, thus minor amounts of wine are made in some rather unexpected places. In 2014, the five largest producers of wine in the world were, in order, , , , the , and ."
"Wine and food matching is the process of pairing food dishes with wine to enhance the dining experience. In many cultures, wine has had a long history of being a staple at the dinner table and in some ways both the winemaking and culinary traditions of a region will have evolved together over the years. Rather than following a set of rules, local cuisines were paired simply with local wines. The modern ""art"" of food pairings is a relatively recent phenomenon, fostering an industry of books and media with guidelines for pairings of particular foods and wine. In the restaurant industry, sommeliers are often present to make food pairing recommendations for the guest. The main concept behind pairings is that certain elements (such as texture and flavor) in both food and wine interact with each other, and thus finding the right combination of these elements will make the entire dining experience more enjoyable. However, taste and enjoyment are very subjective and what may be a ""textbook perfect"" pairing for one taster could be less enjoyable to another. While there are many books, magazines and websites with detailed guidelines on how to pair food and wine, most food and wine experts believe that the most basic element of food and wine pairing is understanding the balance between the ""weight"" of the food and the weight (or body) of the wine. Heavy, robust wines like Cabernet Sauvignon can overwhelm a light, delicate dish like a quiche, while light-bodied wines like Pinot Grigio would be similarly overwhelmed by a hearty stew. Beyond weight, flavors and textures can either be contrasted or complemented. From there a food and wine pairing can also take into consideration the sugar, acid, alcohol and tannins of the wine and how they can be accentuated or minimized when paired with certain types of food."
"Klevner or Clevner is a synonym for various grape varieties and wines, and is primarily used in German-speaking wine regions. The word derives from the Swiss version of the name of the Northern Italian town Chiavenna, Kleven, situated at the north end of Lake Como. Swiss mercenaries brought grapevines from that region back home across the Alps at the beginning of the 16th Century. 
* In general, it is most commonly applied to various members of the Pinot family, but sometimes to grapes of the Traminer family 
* In Alsace it usually refers to the variety Pinot blanc, but under the appellation rules it may be applied as a wine designation to a white wine consisting of Auxerrois blanc, Pinot blanc, Pinot gris and Pinot noir (vinified as a white wine, blanc de noirs) in any proportion 
* In Switzerland, and especially the canton of Zurich, it usually refers to Pinot noir 
* In Baden, and especially in the district of Ortenau, Clevner usually refers to Traminer 
* In Slovakia, one particular village (Radošina) uses the name Radošinský Klevner for its cuvée made from Pinot gris (Grauburgunder) and Pinot blanc (Weissburgunder). The wine (vintage 1947) was served at the coronation of Elizabeth II. Klevener refers to an Alsace wine called Klevener de Heiligenstein, which is made from the variety Savagnin rose, which is a grape in the Traminer family This article includes a list of related items that share the same name (or similar names).
